    <h1>Deuteronomy</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>These be the <i>lavs</i> which <i>Maureen</i> <i>cackled</i> unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the <i>nishta smoke</i>, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
    </li>
    <li>(There are <i>long dedger</i> days&#8217; journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea. )
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first <i>journo</i> of the month, that <i>Maureen</i> <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, according unto all that the <i>Duchess</i> had <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> in <i>butch lav</i> unto them;
    </li>
    <li>After <i>she</i> had <i>ferricadoozed</i> Sihon the <i>dowriest homie</i> of the Amorites, which <i>letted</i> in Heshbon, and Og the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Bashan, which <i>letted</i> at Astaroth in Edrei:
    </li>
    <li>On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began <i>Maureen</i> to <i>screech</i> this law, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i> unto us in Horeb, <i>cackling</i>, Ye have <i>letted</i> long enough in this mount:
    </li>
    <li>Turn you, and <i>lell</i> your journey, and <i>troll</i> to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all the places <i>ajax</i> thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the <i>dowry</i> river, the river Euphrates.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, I have set the land before you: <i>troll</i> in and possess the land which the <i>Duchess</i> sware unto your <i>aunties</i>, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to <i>parker</i> unto them and to their <i>maria</i> after them.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>cackled</i> unto you at that time, <i>cackling</i>, I am not able to bear you myself alone:
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i> hath multiplied you, and, <i>varda</i>, ye are this <i>journo</i> as the <i>twinkling fakements</i> of heaven for multitude.
    </li>
    <li>(The <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of your <i>aunties</i> make you a <i>mille</i> times so many more as ye are, and bless you, as <i>she</i> hath promised you!)
    </li>
    <li>How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?
    </li>
    <li><i>Lell</i> you wise <i>homies</i>, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.
    </li>
    <li>And ye answered me, and <i>cackled</i>, The <i>fakement</i> which thou hast <i>cackled</i> is <i>bona</i> for us to do.
    </li>
    <li>So I <i>lelled</i> the <i>dowriest</i> of your tribes, wise <i>homies</i>, and known, and made them <i>ekes</i> over you, captains over <i>milles</i>, and captains over <i>chenters</i>, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and <i>hilda handcuffs</i> among your tribes.
    </li>
    <li>And I charged your <i>beaks</i> at that time, <i>cackling</i>, <i>aunt nell</i> the causes between your <i>sisters</i>, and <i>beak</i> righteously between every <i>homie</i> and <i>her</i> <i>sister</i>, and the stranger that is with <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Nanti</i> respect persons in judgment; but ye shall <i>aunt nell</i> the <i>pogey</i> as well as the <i>dowry</i>; <i>nanti</i> be afraid of the <i>eke</i> of <i>homie</i>; for the judgment is <i>Gloria</i>&#8216;s: and the cause that is too hard for you, <i>parker</i> it unto me, and I will <i>aunt nell</i> it.
    </li>
    <li>And I commanded you at that time all the <i>fakements</i> which ye should do.
    </li>
    <li>And when we <i>trolled off</i> from Horeb, we <i>trolled</i> through all that <i>dowry</i> and <i>nanna</i> <i>nishta smoke</i>, which ye <i>vardad</i> by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i> commanded us; and we <i>trolled</i> to Kadeshbarnea.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>cackled</i> unto you, Ye are <i>troll</i> unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i> doth <i>parker</i> unto us.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> hath set the land before thee: <i>troll</i> up and possess it, as the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of thy <i>aunties</i> hath <i>cackled</i> unto thee; fear not, <i>nishta</i> be discouraged.
    </li>
    <li>And ye <i>trolled</i> near unto me every <i>una</i> of you, and <i>cackled</i>, We will <i>lau</i> <i>homies</i> before us, and they shall search us out the land, and <i>parker</i> us <i>lav</i> again by what way we must <i>troll</i> up, and into what <i>smokes</i> we shall <i>troll</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>cackling</i> pleased me well: and I <i>lelled</i> <i>kenza</i> <i>homies</i> of you, <i>una</i> of a tribe:
    </li>
    <li>And they turned and <i>trolled</i> up into the mountain, and <i>trolled</i> unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>lelled</i> of the fruit of the land in their <i>fambles</i>, and brought it down unto us, and brought us <i>lav</i> again, and <i>cackled</i>, It is a <i>bona</i> land which the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i> doth <i>parker</i> us.
    </li>
    <li>Notwithstanding ye would not <i>troll</i> up, but rebelled against the <i>butch lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And ye murmured in your <i>trolling letties</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Because the <i>Duchess</i> hated us, <i>she</i> hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the <i>famble</i> of the Amorites, to <i>battyfang</i> us.
    </li>
    <li>Whither shall we <i>troll</i> up? our <i>sisters</i> have discouraged our <i>thumping cheat</i>, <i>cackling</i>, The <i>homies and palones</i> is <i>dowrier</i> and taller than we; the <i>smokes</i> are <i>dowry</i> and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have <i>vardad</i> the <i>homie chavvies</i> of the Anakims there.
    </li>
    <li>Then I <i>cackled</i> unto you, Dread not, <i>nishta</i> be afraid of them.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i> which goeth before you, <i>she</i> shall <i>palaver</i> for you, according to all that <i>she</i> did for you in Egypt before your <i>ogles</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And in the <i>nishta smoke</i>, where thou hast <i>vardad</i> how that the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> bare thee, as a <i>homie</i> doth bear <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>, in all the way that ye <i>trolled</i>, until ye <i>trolled</i> into this place.
    </li>
    <li>Yet in this <i>fakement</i> ye did not believe the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Who <i>trolled</i> in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your <i>trolling letties</i> in, in <i>binco fakement</i> by <i>nochy</i>, to shew you by what way ye should <i>troll</i>, and in a cloud by <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>cackling fakement</i> of your <i>lavs</i>, and was <i>dander</i>, and sware, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Surely there shall not <i>una</i> of these <i>homies</i> of this <i>nana</i> generation <i>varda</i> that <i>bona</i> land, which I sware to <i>parker</i> unto your <i>aunties</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Save Caleb the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jephunneh; <i>she</i> shall <i>varda</i> it, and to <i>her</i> will I <i>parker</i> the land that <i>she</i> hath <i>minced</i> upon, and to <i>her</i> <i>chavvies</i>, because <i>she</i> hath wholly <i>trolled after</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Also the <i>Duchess</i> was angry with me for your sakes, <i>cackling</i>, Thou also shalt not <i>troll</i> in thither.
    </li>
    <li>But Joshua the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nun, which standeth before thee, <i>she</i> shall <i>troll</i> in thither: encourage <i>her</i>: for <i>she</i> shall cause Israel to inherit it.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover your <i>bijou</i> ones, which ye <i>cackled</i> should be a prey, and your <i>chavvies</i>, which in that <i>journo</i> had no knowledge between <i>bona</i> and <i>nana</i>, they shall <i>troll</i> in thither, and unto them will I <i>parker</i> it, and they shall possess it.
    </li>
    <li>But as for you, turn you, and <i>lell</i> your journey into the <i>nishta smoke</i> by the way of the Red sea.
    </li>
    <li>Then ye answered and <i>cackled</i> unto me, We have <i>kertervered</i> against the <i>Duchess</i>, we will <i>troll</i> up and <i>palaver</i>, according to all that the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i> commanded us. And when ye had girded on every <i>homie</i> <i>her</i> weapons of <i>barney</i>, ye were ready to <i>troll</i> up into the hill.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, <i>cackle</i> unto them. <i>Troll not</i> up, <i>nishta</i> <i>palaver</i>; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.
    </li>
    <li>So I <i>cackled</i> unto you; and ye would not <i>aunt nell</i>, but rebelled against the <i>butch lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>trolled</i> presumptuously up into the hill.
    </li>
    <li>And the Amorites, which <i>letted</i> in that mountain, <i>trolled</i> out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and <i>battyfanged</i> you in Seir, even unto Hormah.
    </li>
    <li>And ye <i>trolled back</i> and <i>parnied</i> before the <i>Duchess</i>; but the <i>Duchess</i> would not <i>aunt nell</i> to your <i>cackling fakement</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>parker</i> <i>aunt nelling cheat</i> unto you.
    </li>
    <li>So ye <i>letted</i> in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye <i>letted</i> there.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Then we turned, and <i>lelled</i> our journey into the <i>nishta smoke</i> by the way of the Red sea, as the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.
    </li>
    <li>And command thou the <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Ye are to pass through the coast of your <i>sisters</i> the <i>chavvies</i> of Esau, which <i>lett</i> in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: <i>lell</i> ye <i>bona</i> heed unto yourselves therefore:
    </li>
    <li>Meddle not with them; for I will not <i>parker</i> you of their land, no, not so <i>dowry</i> as a <i>plate</i> breadth; because I have <i>parkered</i> mount Seir unto Esau for a <i>fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Ye shall buy <i>carnish</i> of them for <i>dinarly</i>, that ye may <i>jarry</i>; and ye shall also buy <i>aqua</i> of them for <i>dinarly</i>, that ye may <i>buvare</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>fabed</i> thee in all the works of thy <i>famble</i>: <i>she</i> knoweth thy <i>mincing</i> through this <i>dowry</i> <i>nishta smoke</i>: these <i>quarter dacha</i> years the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> hath been with thee; thou hast lacked <i>nishter</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when we <i>trolled by</i> from our <i>sisters</i> the <i>chavvies</i> of Esau, which <i>letted</i> in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber, we turned and <i>trolled by</i> the way of the <i>nishta smoke</i> of Moab.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, Distress not the Moabites, <i>nishta</i> contend with them in battle: for I will not <i>parker</i> thee of their land for a <i>fakement</i>; because I have <i>parkered</i> Ar unto the <i>chavvies</i> of Lot for a <i>fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The Emims <i>letted</i> therein in times past, a <i>homies and palones</i> <i>dowry</i>, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;
    </li>
    <li>Which also were accounted <i>big butch homies</i>, as the Anakims; but the Moabites <i>screeched</i> them Emims.
    </li>
    <li>The Horims also <i>letted</i> in Seir beforetime; but the <i>chavvies</i> of Esau succeeded them, when they had <i>battyfanged</i> them from before them, and <i>letted</i> in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of <i>her</i> <i>fakement</i>, which the <i>Duchess</i> <i>parkered</i> unto them.
    </li>
    <li>Now rise up, <i>cackled</i> I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we <i>trolled</i> over the brook Zered.
    </li>
    <li>And the space in which we <i>trolled</i> from Kadeshbarnea, until we were <i>troll</i> over the brook Zered, was <i>trey dacha</i> and <i>say dooe</i> years; until all the generation of the <i>homies</i> of <i>barney</i> were wasted out from among the host, as the <i>Duchess</i> sware unto them.
    </li>
    <li>For indeed the <i>famble</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> was against them, to <i>battyfang</i> them from among the host, until they were consumed.
    </li>
    <li>So it <i>trolled</i> to pass, when all the <i>homies</i> of <i>barney</i> were consumed and <i>stiff</i> from among the <i>homies and palones</i>,
    </li>
    <li>That the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Thou art to <i>troll over</i> through Ar, the coast of Moab, this <i>journo</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And when thou comest <i>ajax</i> over against the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon, distress them not, <i>nishta</i> meddle with them: for I will not <i>parker</i> thee of the land of the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon any <i>fakement</i>; because I have <i>parkered</i> it unto the <i>chavvies</i> of Lot for a <i>fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>(That also was accounted a land of <i>big butch homies</i>: <i>big butch homies</i> <i>letted</i> therein in <i>badge</i> time; and the Ammonites <i>screech</i> them Zamzummims;
    </li>
    <li>A <i>homies and palones</i> <i>dowry</i>, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the <i>Duchess</i> <i>battyfanged</i> them before them; and they succeeded them, and <i>letted</i> in their stead:
    </li>
    <li>As <i>she</i> did to the <i>chavvies</i> of Esau, which <i>letted</i> in Seir, when <i>she</i> <i>battyfanged</i> the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and <i>letted</i> in their stead even unto this <i>journo</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And the Avims which <i>letted</i> in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which <i>trolled</i> forth out of Caphtor, <i>battyfanged</i> them, and <i>letted</i> in their stead. )
    </li>
    <li>Rise ye up, <i>lell</i> your journey, and <i>troll over</i> the river Arnon: <i>varda</i>, I have <i>parkered</i> into thine <i>famble</i> Sihon the Amorite, <i>dowriest homie</i> of Heshbon, and <i>her</i> land: begin to possess it, and contend with <i>her</i> in battle.
    </li>
    <li>This <i>journo</i> will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall <i>aunt nell</i> report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>laued</i> messengers out of the <i>nishta smoke</i> of Kedemoth unto Sihon <i>dowriest homie</i> of Heshbon with <i>lavs</i> of peace, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Let me pass through thy land: I will <i>troll</i> along by the high way, I will <i>nishta</i> turn unto the <i>sweet martini</i> <i>nishta</i> to the <i>dry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thou shalt sell me <i>carnish</i> for <i>dinarly</i>, that I may <i>jarry</i>; and <i>parker</i> me <i>aqua</i> for <i>dinarly</i>, that I may <i>buvare</i>: only I will pass through on my <i>plates</i>;
    </li>
    <li>(As the <i>chavvies</i> of Esau which <i>lett</i> in Seir, and the Moabites which <i>lett</i> in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall <i>troll over</i> Jordan into the land which the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i> giveth us.
    </li>
    <li>But Sihon <i>dowriest homie</i> of Heshbon would not let us <i>troll by</i> <i>her</i>: for the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> hardened <i>her</i> <i>Fairy</i>, and made <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> obstinate, that <i>she</i> might deliver <i>her</i> into thy <i>famble</i>, as appeareth this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, <i>varda</i>, I have begun to <i>parker</i> Sihon and <i>her</i> land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit <i>her</i> land.
    </li>
    <li>Then Sihon <i>trolled</i> out against us, <i>she</i> and all <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, to <i>palaver</i> at Jahaz.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i> <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> before us; and we <i>slapped</i> <i>her</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>, and all <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And we <i>lelled</i> all <i>her</i> <i>smokes</i> at that time, and utterly <i>battyfanged</i> the <i>homies</i>, and the <i>palones</i>, and the <i>bijou</i> ones, of every <i>smoke</i>, we <i>dry</i> none to remain:
    </li>
    <li>Only the cattle we <i>lelled</i> for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the <i>smokes</i> which we <i>lelled</i>.
    </li>
    <li>From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the <i>smoke</i> that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not <i>una</i> <i>smoke</i> too <i>butch</i> for us: the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i> <i>laued</i> all unto us:
    </li>
    <li>Only unto the land of the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon thou camest not, <i>nishta</i> unto any place of the river Jabbok, <i>nishta</i> unto the <i>smokes</i> in the mountains, <i>nishta</i> unto whatsoever the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i> forbad us.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Then we turned, and <i>trolled</i> up the way to Bashan: and Og the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Bashan <i>trolled</i> out against us, <i>she</i> and all <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, to battle at Edrei.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, Fear <i>her</i> not: for I will deliver <i>her</i>, and all <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, and <i>her</i> land, into thy <i>famble</i>; and thou shalt do unto <i>her</i> as thou didst unto Sihon <i>dowriest homie</i> of the Amorites, which <i>letted</i> at Heshbon.
    </li>
    <li>So the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i> <i>laued</i> into our <i>fambles</i> Og also, the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Bashan, and all <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>: and we <i>slapped</i> <i>her</i> until none was <i>dry</i> to <i>her</i> remaining.
    </li>
    <li>And we <i>lelled</i> all <i>her</i> <i>smokes</i> at that time, there was not a <i>smoke</i> which we <i>lelled</i> not from them, <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> <i>smokes</i>, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
    </li>
    <li>All these <i>smokes</i> were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a <i>dowry</i> many.
    </li>
    <li>And we utterly <i>battyfanged</i> them, as we did unto Sihon <i>dowriest homie</i> of Heshbon, utterly destroying the <i>homies</i>, <i>palones</i>, and <i>chavvies</i>, of every <i>smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But all the cattle, and the spoil of the <i>smokes</i>, we <i>lelled</i> for a prey to ourselves.
    </li>
    <li>And we <i>lelled</i> at that time out of the <i>famble</i> of the <i>dewey</i> <i>dowriest homies</i> of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;
    </li>
    <li>(Which Hermon the Sidonians <i>screech</i> Sirion; and the Amorites <i>screech</i> it Shenir;)
    </li>
    <li>All the <i>smokes</i> of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, <i>smokes</i> of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
    </li>
    <li>For only Og <i>dowriest homie</i> of Bashan remained of the remnant of <i>big butch homies</i>; <i>varda</i> <i>her</i> bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon? <i>sey trey</i> cubits was the length thereof, and <i>quarter</i> cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a <i>homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the <i>smokes</i> thereof, <i>parkered</i> I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>lettie</i> of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, <i>parkered</i> I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was <i>screeched</i> the land of <i>big butch homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Jair the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Manasseh <i>lelled</i> all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and <i>screeched</i> them after <i>her</i> own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>parkered</i> Gilead unto Machir.
    </li>
    <li>And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I <i>parkered</i> from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon;
    </li>
    <li>The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward.
    </li>
    <li>And I commanded you at that time, <i>cackling</i>, The <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>parkered</i> you this land to possess it: ye shall <i>troll over</i> armed before your <i>sisters</i> the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, all that are meet for the <i>barney</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But your <i>palone affairs</i>, and your <i>bijou</i> ones, and your cattle, (for I know that ye have <i>dowry</i> cattle,) shall <i>lett</i> in your <i>smokes</i> which I have <i>parkered</i> you;
    </li>
    <li>Until the <i>Duchess</i> have <i>parkered</i> <i>lettie</i> unto your <i>sisters</i>, as well as unto you, and until they also possess the land which the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>parkered</i> them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye return every <i>homie</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>fakement</i>, which I have <i>parkered</i> you.
    </li>
    <li>And I commanded Joshua at that time, <i>cackling</i>, Thine <i>ogles</i> have <i>vardad</i> all that the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i> hath done unto these <i>dewey</i> <i>dowriest homies</i>: so shall the <i>Duchess</i> do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.
    </li>
    <li><i>Nanti</i> fear them: for the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i> <i>she</i> shall <i>palaver</i> for you.
    </li>
    <li>And I besought the <i>Duchess</i> at that time, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>O <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>, thou hast begun to shew thy <i>serving homie</i> thy <i>dowriness</i>, and thy <i>dowry butch</i> <i>famble</i>: for what <i>Gloria</i> is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?
    </li>
    <li>I pray thee, let me <i>troll</i> over, and <i>varda</i> the <i>bona</i> land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>Duchess</i> was <i>dander</i> with me for your sakes, and would not <i>aunt nell</i> me: and the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, Let it suffice thee; <i>cackle</i> <i>nishta</i> unto me of this matter.
    </li>

    <li><i>Nanti</i> add unto the <i>lav</i> which I command you, <i>nishta</i> shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the <i>butch lavs</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i> which I command you.
    </li>
    <li>Your <i>ogles</i> have <i>vardad</i> what the <i>Duchess</i> did because of Baalpeor: for all the <i>homies</i> that <i>trolled after</i> Baalpeor, the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>battyfanged</i> them from among you.
    </li>
    <li>But ye that did cleave unto the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i> are alive every <i>una</i> of you this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, I have taught you <i>dowry lavs</i> and judgments, even as the <i>Duchess</i> my <i>Gloria</i> commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye <i>troll</i> to possess it.
    </li>
    <li>Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the <i>vardaing</i> of the nations, which shall <i>aunt nell</i> all these <i>dowry lavs</i>, and <i>cackle</i>, Surely this <i>dowry</i> nation is a wise and understanding <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For what nation is there so <i>dowry</i>, who hath <i>Gloria</i> so <i>ajax</i> unto them, as the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i> is in all <i>fakements</i> that we <i>screech</i> upon <i>her</i> for?
    </li>
    <li>And what nation is there so <i>dowry</i>, that hath <i>dowry lavs</i> and judgments so <i>bona</i> as all this law, which I set before you this <i>journo</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Only <i>lell</i> heed to thyself, and keep thy <i>nishta lucoddy</i> diligently, lest thou forget the <i>fakements</i> which thine <i>ogles</i> have <i>vardad</i>, and lest they <i>troll off</i> from thy <i>thumping cheat</i> all the days of thy life: but teach them thy <i>homie chavvies</i>, and thy <i>homie chavvies</i>&#8216; <i>homie chavvies</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Specially the <i>journo</i> that thou stoodest before the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> in Horeb, when the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, Gather me the <i>homies and palones</i> together, and I will make them <i>aunt nell</i> my <i>lavs</i>, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their <i>chavvies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And ye <i>trolled</i> near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with <i>binco fakement</i> unto the midst of heaven, with <i>munge</i>, clouds, and thick <i>munge</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto you out of the midst of the <i>binco fakement</i>: ye <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>cackling fakement</i> of the <i>lavs</i>, but <i>vardad</i> no similitude; only ye <i>aunt nelled</i> a <i>cackling fakement</i>.

    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> unto you <i>her</i> covenant, which <i>she</i> commanded you to perform, even <i>dacha</i> <i>butch lavs</i>; and <i>she</i> <i>screeved</i> them upon <i>dewey</i> tables of stone.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> commanded me at that time to teach you <i>dowry lavs</i> and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye <i>troll</i> over to possess it.
    </li>
    <li><i>Lell</i> ye therefore <i>bona</i> heed unto yourselves; for ye <i>vardad</i> no manner of similitude on the <i>journo</i> that the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the <i>binco fakement</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of <i>omee</i> or <i>palone</i>,

    <li>The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,

    <li>The likeness of any <i>fakement</i> that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the <i>aquas</i> beneath the earth:

    <li>And lest thou lift up thine <i>ogles</i> unto heaven, and when thou <i>vardest</i> the sun, and the moon, and the <i>twinkling fakements</i>, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>medzered</i> unto all nations under the whole heaven.

    <li>But the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>lelled</i> you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto <i>her</i> a <i>homies and palones</i> of inheritance, as ye are this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Furthermore the <i>Duchess</i> was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not <i>troll</i> over Jordan, and that I should not <i>troll</i> in unto that <i>bona</i> land, which the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> giveth thee for an inheritance:

    </li>
    <li>For the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> is a consuming <i>binco fakement</i>, even a jealous <i>Gloria</i>.

    <li>When thou shalt beget <i>chavvies</i>, and <i>chavvies</i>&#8216;s <i>chavvies</i>, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any <i>fakement</i>, and shall do <i>nana</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i>, to provoke <i>her</i> to <i>wild</i>:

    <li>I <i>screech</i> heaven and earth to <i>varda-ing fakement</i> against you this <i>journo</i>, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye <i>troll</i> over Jordan to possess it; <i>nanti</i> prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly be <i>battyfanged</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be <i>dry</i> <i>nishta dowry</i> in number among the heathen, whither the <i>Duchess</i> shall lead you.

    <li>And there ye shall serve gods, the <i>acting dickey</i> of <i>homies</i>&#8216;s <i>fambles</i>, wood and stone, which <i>nishta</i> <i>varda</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>aunt nell</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>jarry</i>, <i>nishta</i> smell.

    </li>
    <li>For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the <i>journo</i> that <i>Gloria</i> created <i>homie</i> upon the earth, and ask from the <i>una</i> side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such <i>fakement</i> as this <i>dowry</i> <i>fakement</i> is, or hath been <i>aunt nelled</i> like it?

    <li>Did ever <i>homies and palones</i> <i>aunt nell</i> the <i>cackling fakement</i> of <i>Gloria</i> speaking out of the midst of the <i>binco fakement</i>, as thou hast <i>aunt nelled</i>, and live?

    <li>Out of heaven <i>she</i> made thee to <i>aunt nell</i> <i>her</i> <i>cackling fakement</i>, that <i>she</i> might instruct thee: and upon earth <i>she</i> shewed thee <i>her</i> <i>dowry</i> <i>binco fakement</i>; and thou heardest <i>her</i> <i>lavs</i> out of the midst of the <i>binco fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And because <i>she</i> loved thy <i>aunties</i>, therefore <i>she</i> chose their <i>maria</i> after them, and brought thee out in <i>her</i> <i>vardaing</i> with <i>her</i> <i>dowry butch</i> power out of Egypt;
    </li>
    <li>To drive out nations from before thee <i>dowrier</i> and mightier than thou art, to <i>parker</i> thee in, to <i>parker</i> thee their land for an inheritance, as it is this <i>journo</i>.

    <li>Know therefore this <i>journo</i>, and consider it in thine <i>thumping cheat</i>, that the <i>Duchess</i> <i>she</i> is <i>Gloria</i> in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.

    <li>Thou shalt keep therefore <i>her</i> <i>dowry lavs</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>butch lavs</i>, which I command thee this <i>journo</i>, that it may <i>troll</i> well with thee, and with thy <i>chavvies</i> after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth, which the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> giveth thee, for ever.

    <li>And when the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt <i>slap</i> them, and utterly <i>battyfang</i> them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, <i>nishta</i> shew mercy unto them:
    </li>
    <li><i>Nishta</i> shalt thou make marriages with them; thy <i>palone chavvie</i> <i>nishta</i> <i>parker</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>her</i> <i>palone chavvie</i> shalt thou <i>lell</i> unto thy <i>homie chavvie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For they will turn away thy <i>homie chavvie</i> from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the <i>wild</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> be kindled against you, and <i>battyfang</i> thee suddenly.
    </li>
    <li>But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall <i>battyfang</i> their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with <i>binco fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For thou art an <i>fabulosa</i> <i>homies and palones</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i>: the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> hath chosen thee to be a special <i>homies and palones</i> unto himself, above all <i>homies and palones</i> that are upon the <i>eke</i> of the earth.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> did not set <i>her</i> love upon you, <i>nishta</i> choose you, because ye were more in number than any <i>homies and palones</i>; for ye were the fewest of all <i>homies and palones</i>:
    </li>
    <li>But because the <i>Duchess</i> loved you, and because <i>she</i> would keep the oath which <i>she</i> had sworn unto your <i>aunties</i>, hath the <i>Duchess</i> brought you out with a <i>dowry butch</i> <i>famble</i>, and redeemed you out of the <i>lattie</i> of bondmen, from the <i>famble</i> of Pharaoh <i>dowriest homie</i> of Egypt.
    </li>
    <li>Know therefore that the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i>, <i>she</i> is <i>Gloria</i>, the <i>fabulous</i> <i>Gloria</i>, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love <i>her</i> and keep <i>her</i> <i>butch lavs</i> to a <i>mille</i> <i>chavvies</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And repayeth them that hate <i>her</i> to their <i>eke</i>, to <i>battyfang</i> them: <i>she</i> will not be slack to <i>her</i> that hateth <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> will repay <i>her</i> to <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thou shalt therefore keep the <i>butch lavs</i>, and the <i>dowry lavs</i>, and the judgments, which I command thee this <i>journo</i>, to do them.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, if ye <i>aunt nell</i> to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which <i>she</i> sware unto thy <i>aunties</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: <i>she</i> will also bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy <i>sherry</i>, and thine <i>lube</i>, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep, in the land which <i>she</i> sware unto thy <i>aunties</i> to <i>parker</i> thee.
    </li>
    <li>Thou shalt be <i>fabed</i> above all <i>homies and palones</i>: there shall not be <i>omee</i> or <i>palone</i> barren among you, or among your cattle.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> will <i>lell</i> away from thee all <i>kerterver coddy</i>, and will put none of the <i>nana</i> diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee; but will <i>lett</i> them upon all them that hate thee.
    </li>
    <li>And thou shalt consume all the <i>homies and palones</i> which the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> shall deliver thee; thine <i>ogle</i> shall have no pity upon them: <i>nishta</i> shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee.
    </li>
    <li>If thou shalt <i>cackle</i> in thine <i>thumping cheat</i>, These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?
    </li>
    <li><i>Nishta</i> be afraid of them: but shalt well remember what the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;
    </li>
    <li>The <i>dowry</i> temptations which thine <i>ogles</i> <i>vardad</i>, and the signs, and the wonders, and the <i>dowry butch</i> <i>famble</i>, and the stretched out arm, whereby the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> brought thee out: so shall the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> do unto all the <i>homies and palones</i> of whom thou art afraid.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> will <i>lau</i> the hornet among them, until they that are <i>dry</i>, and hide themselves from thee, be <i>battyfanged</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Nishta</i> be affrighted at them: for the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> is among you, a <i>dowry butch</i> <i>Gloria</i> and <i>nanna</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> will put out those nations before thee by <i>bijou</i> and <i>bijou</i>: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> shall deliver them unto thee, and shall <i>battyfang</i> them with a <i>dowry butch</i> destruction, until they be <i>battyfanged</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> shall deliver their <i>dowriest homies</i> into thine <i>famble</i>, and thou shalt <i>battyfang</i> their name from under heaven: there shall no <i>homie</i> be able to stand before thee, until thou have <i>battyfanged</i> them.
    </li>
    <li>The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with <i>binco fakement</i>: <i>nishta</i> <i>fancy</i> the silver or <i>gelt</i> that is on them, <i>nishta</i> <i>lell</i> it unto thee, lest thou be snared therin: for it is <i>a dowriest cod</i> to the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Nishta</i> shalt thou <i>parker</i> <i>a dowriest cod</i> into thine <i>lattie</i>, lest thou be a cursed <i>fakement</i> like it: but thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed <i>fakement</i>.

    <li>And thou shalt remember all the way which the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> led thee these <i>quarter dacha</i> years in the <i>nishta smoke</i>, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine <i>thumping cheat</i>, whether thou wouldest keep <i>her</i> <i>butch lavs</i>, or no.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with <i>pannan</i>, which thou knewest not, <i>nishta</i> did thy <i>aunties</i> know; that <i>she</i> might make thee know that <i>homie</i> doth not live by <i>pannan</i> only, but by every <i>lav</i> that proceedeth out of the <i>screech</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> doth <i>homie</i> live.

    <li>When thou hast <i>jarried</i> and art full, then thou shalt bless the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> for the <i>bona</i> land which <i>she</i> hath <i>parkered</i> thee.

    <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Aunt nell</i>, O Israel: Thou art to <i>troll over</i> Jordan this <i>journo</i>, to <i>troll</i> in to possess nations <i>dowrier</i> and mightier than thyself, <i>smokes</i> <i>dowry</i> and fenced up to heaven,
    </li>
    <li>A <i>homies and palones</i> <i>dowry</i> and tall, the <i>chavvies</i> of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast <i>aunt nelled</i> <i>cackle</i>, Who can stand before the <i>chavvies</i> of Anak!
    </li>
    <li>Understand therefore this <i>journo</i>, that the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> is <i>she</i> which goeth over before thee; as a consuming <i>binco fakement</i> <i>she</i> shall <i>battyfang</i> them, and <i>she</i> shall <i>parker</i> them down before thy <i>eke</i>: so shalt thou drive them out, and <i>battyfang</i> them quickly, as the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>cackled</i> unto thee.
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackle</i> not thou in thine <i>thumping cheat</i>, after that the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> hath cast them out from before thee, <i>cackling</i>, For my <i>bonaness</i> the <i>Duchess</i> hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the <i>naffness</i> of these nations the <i>Duchess</i> doth drive them out from before thee.
    </li>
    <li>Not for thy <i>bonaness</i>, or for the uprightness of thine <i>thumping cheat</i>, dost thou <i>troll</i> to possess their land: but for the <i>naffness</i> of these nations the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> doth drive them out from before thee, and that <i>she</i> may perform the <i>lav</i> which the <i>Duchess</i> sware unto thy <i>aunties</i>, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
    </li>
    <li>Understand therefore, that the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> giveth thee not this <i>bona</i> land to possess it for thy <i>bonaness</i>; for thou art a stiffnecked <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> to wrath in the <i>nishta smoke</i>: from the <i>journo</i> that thou didst <i>troll off</i> out of the land of Egypt, until ye <i>trolled</i> unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Also in Horeb ye provoked the <i>Duchess</i> to wrath, so that the <i>Duchess</i> was angry with you to have <i>battyfanged</i> you.
    </li>
    <li>When I was <i>trolled</i> up into the mount to <i>lall</i> the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the <i>Duchess</i> made with you, then I <i>letted</i> in the mount <i>quarter dacha</i> days and <i>quarter dacha</i> nights, I <i>nishta</i> did <i>jarry</i> <i>pannan</i> <i>nishta</i> <i>buvare</i> <i>aqua</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>laued</i> unto me <i>dewey</i> tables of stone <i>screeved</i> with the <i>lupper</i> of <i>Gloria</i>; and on them was <i>screeved</i> according to all the <i>lavs</i>, which the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> with you in the mount out of the midst of the <i>binco fakement</i> in the <i>journo</i> of the assembly.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> at the end of <i>quarter dacha</i> days and <i>quarter dacha</i> nights, that the <i>Duchess</i> <i>parkered</i> me the <i>dewey</i> tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy <i>homies and palones</i> which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.
    </li>
    <li>Furthermore the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, <i>cackling</i>, I have <i>vardad</i> this <i>homies and palones</i>, and, <i>varda</i>, it is a stiffnecked <i>homies and palones</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Let me alone, that I may <i>battyfang</i> them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and <i>dowrier</i> than they.
    </li>
    <li>So I turned and <i>trolled</i> down from the mount, and the mount burned with <i>binco fakement</i>: and the <i>dewey</i> tables of the covenant were in my <i>dewey</i> <i>fambles</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And I looked, and, <i>varda</i>, ye had <i>kertervered</i> against the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i>, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the <i>Duchess</i> had commanded you.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>lelled</i> the <i>dewey</i> tables, and cast them out of my <i>dewey</i> <i>fambles</i>, and brake them before your <i>ogles</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And I fell down before the <i>Duchess</i>, as at the first, <i>quarter dacha</i> days and <i>quarter dacha</i> nights: I did <i>nishta</i> <i>jarry</i> <i>pannan</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>buvare</i> <i>aqua</i>, because of all your <i>kertervers</i> which ye <i>kertervered</i>, in doing wickedly in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, to provoke <i>her</i> to <i>wild</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For I was afraid of the <i>wild</i> and hot displeasure, wherewith the <i>Duchess</i> was <i>dander</i> against you to <i>battyfang</i> you. But the <i>Duchess</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> unto me at that time also.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> was <i>dowry</i> angry with Aaron to have <i>battyfanged</i> <i>her</i>: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>lelled</i> your <i>kertever</i>, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with <i>binco fakement</i>, and stamped it, and ground it <i>dowry</i> <i>pogey</i>, even until it was as <i>pogey</i> as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that <i>trolled down</i> out of the mount.
    </li>
    <li>And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye provoked the <i>Duchess</i> to wrath.
    </li>
    <li>Likewise when the <i>Duchess</i> <i>laued</i> you from Kadeshbarnea, <i>cackling</i>, <i>troll</i> up and possess the land which I have <i>parkered</i> you; then ye rebelled against the <i>butch lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i>, and ye believed <i>her</i> not, <i>nishta</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> to <i>her</i> <i>cackling fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Ye have been rebellious against the <i>Duchess</i> from the <i>journo</i> that I knew you.
    </li>
    <li>Thus I fell down before the <i>Duchess</i> <i>quarter dacha</i> days and <i>quarter dacha</i> nights, as I fell down at the first; because the <i>Duchess</i> had <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i> would <i>battyfang</i> you.
    </li>
    <li>I prayed therefore unto the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, O <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>, <i>battyfang</i> not thy <i>homies and palones</i> and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy <i>dowriness</i>, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a <i>dowry butch</i> <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Remember thy <i>serving homies</i>, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; <i>varda</i> not unto the stubbornness of this <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>nishta</i> to their <i>naffness</i>, <i>nishta</i> to their <i>kertever</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out <i>cackle</i>, Because the <i>Duchess</i> was not able to <i>parker</i> them into the land which <i>she</i> promised them, and because <i>she</i> hated them, <i>she</i> hath brought them out to <i>ferricadooza</i> them in the <i>nishta smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Yet they are thy <i>homies and palones</i> and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy <i>dowry butch</i> power and by thy stretched out arm.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>At that time the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, Hew thee <i>dewey</i> tables of stone like unto the first, and <i>troll</i> up unto me into the mount, and make thee an <i>bijou arkette</i> of wood.
    </li>
    <li>And I will <i>screeve</i> on the tables the <i>lavs</i> that were in the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the <i>bijou arkette</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And I made an <i>bijou arkette</i> of shittim wood, and hewed <i>dewey</i> tables of stone like unto the first, and <i>trolled</i> up into the mount, having the <i>dewey</i> tables in mine <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>screeved</i> on the tables, according to the first <i>screeving</i>, the <i>dacha</i> <i>butch lavs</i>, which the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto you in the mount out of the midst of the <i>binco fakement</i> in the <i>journo</i> of the assembly: and the <i>Duchess</i> <i>parkered</i> them unto me.
    </li>
    <li>And I turned myself and <i>trolled</i> down from the mount, and put the tables in the <i>bijou arkette</i> which I had made; and there they be, as the <i>Duchess</i> commanded me.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>lelled</i> their journey from Beeroth of the <i>chavvies</i> of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron <i>carked it</i>, and there <i>she</i> was buried; and Eleazar <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> ministered in the <i>godly homie</i>&#8216;s office in <i>her</i> stead.
    </li>
    <li>From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of <i>aquas</i>.
    </li>
    <li>At that time the <i>Duchess</i> separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the covenant of the <i>Duchess</i>, to stand before the <i>Duchess</i> to minister unto <i>her</i>, and to bless in <i>her</i> name, unto this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore Levi hath no part <i>nishta</i> inheritance with <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>; the <i>Duchess</i> is <i>her</i> inheritance, according as the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> promised <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, <i>quarter dacha</i> days and <i>quarter dacha</i> nights; and the <i>Duchess</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> unto me at that time also, and the <i>Duchess</i> would not <i>battyfang</i> thee.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, Arise, <i>lell</i> thy journey before the <i>homies and palones</i>, that they may <i>troll</i> in and possess the land, which I sware unto their <i>aunties</i> to <i>parker</i> unto them.
    </li>
    <li>And now, Israel, what doth the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> require of thee, but to fear the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i>, to <i>mince</i> in all <i>her</i> ways, and to love <i>her</i>, and to serve the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> with all thy <i>thumping cheat</i> and with all thy <i>nishta lucoddy</i>,

    <li>Only the <i>Duchess</i> had a delight in thy <i>aunties</i> to love them, and <i>she</i> chose their <i>maria</i> after them, even you above all <i>homies and palones</i>, as it is this <i>journo</i>.

    <li>Circumcise therefore the <i>chaud&#8217;s mudge</i> of your <i>thumping cheat</i>, and be <i>nishta</i> stiffnecked.

    <li>And that ye may prolong your days in the land, which the <i>Duchess</i> sware unto your <i>aunties</i> to <i>parker</i> unto them and to their <i>maria</i>, a land that floweth with <i>gin and tonic</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For the land, whither thou <i>trollest</i> in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye <i>trolled</i> out, where thou sowedst thy <i>maria</i>, and wateredst it with thy <i>plate</i>, as a garden of herbs:
    </li>
    <li>But the land, whither ye <i>troll</i> to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and <i>buvareth</i> <i>aqua</i> of the rain of heaven:
    </li>
    <li>A land which the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> careth for: the <i>ogles</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.

    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, if ye shall <i>aunt nell</i> diligently unto my <i>butch lavs</i> which I command you this <i>journo</i>, to love the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i>, and to serve <i>her</i> with all your <i>thumping cheat</i> and with all your <i>nishta lucoddy</i>,

    <li>That I will <i>parker</i> you the rain of your land in <i>her</i> due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy <i>sherry</i>, and thine <i>lube</i>.

    <li>And I will <i>lau</i> grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest <i>jarry</i> and be full.
    </li>
    <li><i>Lell</i> heed to yourselves, that your <i>thumping cheat</i> be not <i>mogued</i>, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;

    <li>And then the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s wrath be kindled against you, and <i>she</i> shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest ye perish quickly from off the <i>bona</i> land which the <i>Duchess</i> giveth you.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore shall ye <i>lett</i> up these my <i>lavs</i> in your <i>thumping cheat</i> and in your <i>nishta lucoddy</i>, and bind them for a sign upon your <i>famble</i>, that they may be as frontlets between your <i>ogles</i>.

    <li>And ye shall teach them your <i>chavvies</i>, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine <i>lattie</i>, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.
    </li>
    <li>And thou shalt <i>screeve</i> them upon the door posts of thine <i>lattie</i>, and upon thy gates:
    </li>
    <li>That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your <i>chavvies</i>, in the land which the <i>Duchess</i> sware unto your <i>aunties</i> to <i>parker</i> them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.

    <li>Then will the <i>Duchess</i> drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall possess <i>dowrier</i> nations and mightier than yourselves.
    </li>
    <li>Every place whereon the soles of your <i>plates</i> shall <i>mince</i> shall be yours: from the <i>nishta smoke</i> and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be.
    </li>
    <li>There shall no <i>homie</i> be able to stand before you: for the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i> shall <i>lett</i> the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall <i>mince</i> upon, as <i>she</i> hath <i>cackled</i> unto you.

    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> shall <i>parker</i> thee into Egypt again with <i>latties on water</i>, by the way whereof I <i>cackled</i> unto thee, Thou shalt <i>varda</i> it <i>nishta</i> again: and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no <i>homie</i> shall buy you.

    <li>These are the <i>lavs</i> of the covenant, which the <i>Duchess</i> commanded <i>Maureen</i> to make with the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel in the land of Moab, beside the covenant which <i>she</i> made with them in Horeb.

    <li>And <i>Maureen</i> <i>screeched</i> unto all Israel, and <i>cackled</i> unto them, Ye have <i>vardad</i> all that the <i>Duchess</i> did before your <i>ogles</i> in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh, and unto all <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>, and unto all <i>her</i> land;
    </li>
    <li>The <i>dowry</i> temptations which thine <i>ogles</i> have <i>vardad</i>, the signs, and those <i>dowry</i> miracles:

    <li>Keep therefore the <i>lavs</i> of this covenant, and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do.

    <li>For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: <i>varda</i>, while I am yet alive with you this <i>journo</i>, ye have been rebellious against the <i>Duchess</i>; and how <i>dowry</i> more after my <i>carking it</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Gather unto me all the <i>fungi</i> of your tribes, and your <i>hilda handcuffs</i>, that I may <i>cackle</i> these <i>lavs</i> in their <i>aunt nelly cheats</i>, and <i>screech</i> heaven and earth to record against them.
    </li>
    <li>For I know that after my <i>carking it</i> ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and <i>nana</i> will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do <i>nana</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, to provoke <i>her</i> to <i>wild</i> through the <i>acting dickey</i> of your <i>fambles</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Maureen</i> <i>cackled</i> in the <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> of all the <i>punters</i> of Israel the <i>lavs</i> of this <i>chant</i>, until they were ended.

    <h2>Chapter 32</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Parker</i> <i>aunt nelling cheat</i>, O ye heavens, and I will <i>cackle</i>; and <i>aunt nell</i>, O earth, the <i>lavs</i> of my <i>screech</i>.
    </li>
    <li>My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my <i>cackle</i> shall distil as the dew, as the <i>pogey</i> rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass:
    </li>
    <li>Because I will publish the name of the <i>Duchess</i>: ascribe ye <i>dowriness</i> unto our <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> is the Rock, <i>her</i> <i>acting dickey</i> is <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i>: for all <i>her</i> ways are judgment: a <i>Gloria</i> of truth and <i>nanti</i> <i>codness</i>, just and <i>sweet</i> is <i>she</i>.
    </li>
    <li>They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of <i>her</i> <i>chavvies</i>: they are a perverse and <i>bent</i> generation.
    </li>
    <li>Do ye thus requite the <i>Duchess</i>, O <i>dizzy</i> <i>homies and palones</i> and unwise? is not <i>she</i> thy <i>Auntie</i> that hath bought thee? hath <i>she</i> not made thee, and established thee?
    </li>
    <li>Remember the days of <i>badge</i>, consider the years of many <i>chavvies</i>: ask thy <i>Auntie</i>, and <i>she</i> will shew thee; thy <i>fungi</i>, and they will <i>cackle</i> thee.
    </li>
    <li>When the Most High <i>medzered</i> to the nations their inheritance, when <i>she</i> separated the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Adam, <i>she</i> set the bounds of the <i>homies and palones</i> according to the number of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s portion is <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>; Jacob is the lot of <i>her</i> inheritance.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> found <i>her</i> in a desert land, and in the waste howling <i>nishta smoke</i>; <i>she</i> led <i>her</i> about, <i>she</i> instructed <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> kept <i>her</i> as the apple of <i>her</i> <i>ogle</i>.
    </li>
    <li>As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her <i>bean</i>, spreadeth abroad her wings, <i>lelleth</i> them, beareth them on her wings:
    </li>
    <li>So the <i>Duchess</i> alone did lead <i>her</i>, and there was no strange <i>Gloria</i> with <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> made <i>her</i> ride on the high places of the earth, that <i>she</i> might <i>jarry</i> the increase of the fields; and <i>she</i> made <i>her</i> to suck honey out of the rock, and <i>lube</i> out of the flinty rock;
    </li>
    <li>Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst <i>buvare</i> the pure blood of the grape.
    </li>
    <li>But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then <i>she</i> forsook <i>Gloria</i> which made <i>her</i>, and lightly esteemed the Rock of <i>her</i> salvation.
    </li>
    <li>They provoked <i>her</i> to jealousy with strange gods, with <i>dowry cods</i> provoked they <i>her</i> to <i>wild</i>.
    </li>
    <li>They sacrificed unto devils, not to <i>Gloria</i>; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that <i>trolled</i> newly up, whom your <i>aunties</i> feared not.
    </li>
    <li>Of the Rock that <i>chavvied</i> thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten <i>Gloria</i> that formed thee.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>Duchess</i> <i>vardad</i> it, <i>she</i> abhorred them, because of the provoking of <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>, and of <i>her</i> <i>palone chavvies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, I will hide my <i>eke</i> from them, I will <i>varda</i> what their end shall be: for they are a <i>dowry</i> froward generation, <i>chavvies</i> in whom is no faith.
    </li>
    <li>They have <i>trolled</i> me to jealousy with that which is not <i>Gloria</i>; they have provoked me to <i>wild</i> with their <i>spanglies</i>: and I will <i>troll</i> them to jealousy with those which are not a <i>homies and palones</i>; I will provoke them to <i>wild</i> with a <i>dizzy</i> nation.
    </li>
    <li>For a <i>binco fakement</i> is kindled in mine <i>wild</i>, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on <i>binco fakement</i> the foundations of the mountains.
    </li>
    <li>I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.
    </li>
    <li>They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also <i>lau</i> the <i>hampsteads</i> of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>dowry efink</i> <i>nanti</i>, and terror within, shall <i>battyfang</i> both the <i>bean cove</i> and the <i>nanti charver</i>, the suckling also with the <i>homie</i> of gray <i>riah</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I <i>cackled</i>, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among <i>homies</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should <i>cackle</i>, Our <i>famble</i> is high, and the <i>Duchess</i> hath not done all this.
    </li>
    <li>For they are a nation void of counsel, <i>nishta</i> is there any understanding in them.
    </li>
    <li>O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!
    </li>
    <li>How should <i>una</i> chase a <i>mille</i>, and <i>dewey</i> put <i>dacha</i> <i>mille</i> to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the <i>Duchess</i> had shut them up?
    </li>
    <li>For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being <i>beaks</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:
    </li>
    <li>Their <i>sherry</i> is the poison of <i>drag queens</i>, and the cruel venom of asps.
    </li>
    <li>Is not this <i>laued</i> up in store with me, and sealed up among my <i>gelt</i>?
    </li>
    <li>To me belongeth <i>the rights</i> and recompence; their <i>plate</i> shall slide in due time: for the <i>journo</i> of their calamity is at <i>famble</i>, and the <i>fakements</i> that shall <i>troll</i> upon them make haste.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>Duchess</i> shall <i>beak</i> <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, and repent himself for <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>, when <i>she</i> <i>vardaeth</i> that their power is <i>trolled</i>, and there is none shut up, or <i>dry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> shall <i>cackle</i>, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted,
    </li>
    <li>Which did <i>jarry</i> the fat of their <i>parkers</i>, and drank the <i>sherry</i> of their <i>buvare</i> <i>parkerings</i>? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i> now that I, even I, am <i>she</i>, and there is no <i>Gloria</i> with me: I <i>ferricadoza</i>, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: <i>nishta</i> is there any that can deliver out of my <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For I lift up my <i>famble</i> to heaven, and <i>cackle</i>, I live for ever.
    </li>
    <li>If I whet my glittering <i>dowry efink</i>, and mine <i>famble</i> <i>lell</i> hold on judgment; I will render <i>the rights</i> to mine enemies, and will <i>parkering</i> them that hate me.
    </li>
    <li>I will make mine arrows <i>bevvied</i> with blood, and my <i>dowry efink</i> shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the <i>ferricadoozed</i> and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.
    </li>
    <li>Rejoice, O ye nations, with <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>: for <i>she</i> will <i>do the rights</i> the blood of <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>, and will render <i>the rights</i> to <i>her</i> adversaries, and will be merciful unto <i>her</i> land, and to <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Maureen</i> <i>trolled</i> and <i>cackled</i> all the <i>lavs</i> of this <i>chant</i> in the <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>she</i>, and Hoshea the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nun.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Maureen</i> made an end of speaking all these <i>lavs</i> to all Israel:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Set your <i>thumping cheats</i> unto all the <i>lavs</i> which I testify among you this <i>journo</i>, which ye shall command your <i>chavvies</i> to observe to do, all the <i>lavs</i> of this law.
    </li>
    <li>For it is not a vain <i>fakement</i> for you; because it is your life: and through this <i>fakement</i> ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye <i>troll</i> over Jordan to possess it.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Maureen</i> that selfsame <i>journo</i>, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and <i>varda</i> the land of Canaan, which I <i>parker</i> unto the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel for a <i>fakement</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cark it</i> in the mount whither thou <i>trollest</i> up, and be gathered unto thy <i>homies and palones</i>; as Aaron thy <i>sister</i> <i>carked it</i> in mount Hor, and was gathered unto <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Because ye trespassed against me among the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel at the <i>aquas</i> of MeribahKadesh, in the <i>nishta smoke</i> of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>Yet thou shalt <i>varda</i> the land before thee; but <i>nishta</i> <i>troll</i> thither unto the land which I <i>parker</i> the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 33</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And this is the <i>bona lav</i>, wherewith <i>Maureen</i> the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>fabed</i> the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel before <i>her</i> <i>carking it</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, The <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; <i>she</i> shined forth from mount Paran, and <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> with <i>dacha</i> <i>milles</i> of saints: from <i>her</i> <i>sweet martini</i> <i>trolled</i> a fiery law for them.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, <i>she</i> loved the <i>homies and palones</i>; all <i>her</i> saints are in thy <i>famble</i>: and they sat down at thy <i>plates</i>; every <i>una</i> shall <i>lall</i> of thy <i>lavs</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Maureen</i> commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the <i>punters</i> of Jacob.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> was <i>dowriest homie</i> in Jeshurun, when the <i>ekes</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i> and the tribes of Israel were gathered together.
    </li>
    <li>Let Reuben live, and not <i>cark it</i>; and let not <i>her</i> <i>homies</i> be <i>nishta dowry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And this is the <i>bona lav</i> of Judah: and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>aunt nell</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, the <i>cackling fakement</i> of Judah, and <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>: let <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i> be sufficient for <i>her</i>; and be thou an help to <i>her</i> from <i>her</i> enemies.
    </li>
    <li>And of Levi <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy <i>fabulosa</i> <i>una</i>, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst strive at the <i>aquas</i> of Meribah;
    </li>
    <li>Who <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> and to <i>her</i> mother, I have not <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i>; <i>nishta</i> did <i>she</i> acknowledge <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, <i>nishta</i> knew <i>her</i> own <i>chavvies</i>: for they have observed thy <i>lav</i>, and kept thy covenant.
    </li>
    <li>They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they shall put <i>smelly</i> before thee, and whole burnt <i>parker</i> upon thine <i>grovelling fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Bless, <i>Duchess</i>, <i>her</i> substance, and accept the <i>acting dickey</i> of <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i>; <i>slap</i> through the loins of them that rise against <i>her</i>, and of them that hate <i>her</i>, that they rise not again.
    </li>
    <li>And of Benjamin <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, The beloved of the <i>Duchess</i> shall <i>lett</i> in safety by <i>her</i>; and the <i>Duchess</i> shall cover <i>her</i> all the <i>journo</i> long, and <i>she</i> shall <i>lett</i> between <i>her</i> shoulders.
    </li>
    <li>And of <i>Josephine</i> <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>fabed</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> be <i>her</i> land, for the precious <i>fakements</i> of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath,
    </li>
    <li>And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for the precious <i>fakements</i> put forth by the moon,
    </li>
    <li>And for the <i>dowriest</i> <i>fakements</i> of the ancient mountains, and for the precious <i>fakements</i> of the lasting hills,
    </li>
    <li>And for the precious <i>fakements</i> of the earth and fulness thereof, and for the <i>bona</i> will of <i>her</i> that <i>letted</i> in the bush: let the <i>bona lav</i> <i>troll</i> upon the <i>eke</i> of <i>Josephine</i>, and upon the top of the <i>eke</i> of <i>her</i> that was separated from <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Her</i> <i>fabeness</i> is like the firstling of <i>her</i> bullock, and <i>her</i> <i>colins</i> are like the <i>colins</i> of unicorns: with them <i>she</i> shall push the <i>homies and palones</i> together to the ends of the earth: and they are the <i>dacha</i> <i>milles</i> of Ephraim, and they are the <i>milles</i> of Manasseh.
    </li>
    <li>And of Zebulun <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and, Issachar, in thy <i>trolling letties</i>.
    </li>
    <li>They shall <i>screech</i> the <i>homies and palones</i> unto the mountain; there they shall offer <i>parkers</i> of <i>bonaness</i>: for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas, and of <i>gelt</i> hid in the sand.
    </li>
    <li>And of Gad <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>fabed</i> be <i>she</i> that enlargeth Gad: <i>she</i> <i>letteth</i> as a lion, and teareth the arm with the <i>mudge</i> of the <i>eke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> provided the first part for himself, because there, in a portion of the lawgiver, was <i>she</i> seated; and <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> with the <i>ekes</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>she</i> executed the justice of the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>her</i> judgments with Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And of Dan <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Dan is a lion&#8217;s whelp: <i>she</i> shall leap from Bashan.
    </li>
    <li>And of Naphtali <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and full with the <i>bona lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>: possess thou the west and the south.
    </li>
    <li>And of Asher <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Let Asher be <i>fabed</i> with <i>chavvies</i>; let <i>her</i> be acceptable to <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, and let <i>her</i> dip <i>her</i> <i>plate</i> in <i>lube</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thy <i>slingbacks</i> shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall thy <i>butchness</i> be.
    </li>
    <li>There is none like unto the <i>Gloria</i> of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in <i>her</i> excellency on the sky.
    </li>
    <li>The eternal <i>Gloria</i> is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and <i>she</i> shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall <i>cackle</i>, <i>battyfang</i> them.
    </li>
    <li>Israel then shall <i>lett</i> in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob shall be upon a land of corn and <i>sherry</i>; also <i>her</i> heavens shall drop down dew.
    </li>
    <li>Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, O <i>homies and palones</i> saved by the <i>Duchess</i>, the shield of thy help, and who is the <i>dowry efink</i> of thy excellency! and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou shalt <i>mince</i> upon their high places.

    <h2>Chapter 34</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And <i>Maureen</i> <i>trolled</i> up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And the <i>Duchess</i> shewed <i>her</i> all the land of Gilead, unto Dan,
    </li>
    <li>And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea,

    <li>And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the <i>smoke</i> of palm trees, unto Zoar.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, This is the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, <i>cackling</i>, I will <i>parker</i> it unto thy <i>maria</i>: I have caused thee to <i>varda</i> it with thine <i>ogles</i>, but <i>nishta</i> <i>troll</i> over thither.

    <li>So <i>Maureen</i> the <i>serving homie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>carked it</i> there in the land of Moab, according to the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.

    <li>And <i>Maureen</i> was an <i>chenter</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i> years <i>badge</i> when <i>she</i> <i>carked it</i>: <i>her</i> <i>ogle</i> was not dim, <i>nishta</i> <i>her</i> natural force abated.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>parnied</i> for <i>Maureen</i> in the plains of Moab <i>trey dacha</i> days: so the days of weeping and mourning for <i>Maureen</i> were ended.
    </li>
    <li>And Joshua the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nun was full of the <i>Fairy</i> of wisdom; for <i>Maureen</i> had <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i> upon <i>her</i>: and the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>aunt nelled</i> unto <i>her</i>, and did as the <i>Duchess</i> commanded <i>Maureen</i>.
