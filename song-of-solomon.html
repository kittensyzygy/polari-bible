    <h1>Song of Solomon</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>The <i>chant</i> of <i>chants</i>, which is Solomon&#8217;s.
    </li>
    <li>Let <i>her</i> kiss me with the kisses of <i>her</i> <i>screech</i>: for thy love is <i>benar</i> than <i>sherry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Because of the savour of thy <i>bona</i> ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the <i>nanti charvers</i> love thee.
    </li>
    <li>Draw me, we will run after thee: the <i>dowriest homie</i> hath brought me into <i>her</i> chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than <i>sherry</i>: the upright love thee.
    </li>
    <li>I am <i>goolie</i>, but comely, O ye <i>palone chavvies</i> of Jerusalem, as the <i>trolling letties</i> of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i> not upon me, because I am <i>goolie</i>, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother&#8217;s <i>chavvies</i> were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept.
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackle</i> me, O thou whom my <i>nishta lucoddy</i> loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to <i>lettie</i> at noon: for why should I be as <i>una</i> that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?
    </li>
    <li>If thou know not, O thou fairest among <i>palones</i>, <i>troll</i> thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds&#8217; <i>trolling letties</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh&#8217;s <i>rattling coves</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thy cheeks are comely with rows of <i>groinage</i>, thy neck with chains of <i>gelt</i>.
    </li>
    <li>We will make thee borders of <i>gelt</i> with studs of silver.
    </li>
    <li>While the <i>dowriest homie</i> sitteth at <i>her</i> table, my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof.
    </li>
    <li>A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me; <i>she</i> shall lie all <i>nochy</i> betwixt my <i>foofs</i>.
    </li>
    <li>My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, thou art <i>filly</i>, my love; <i>varda</i>, thou art <i>filly</i>; thou hast doves&#8217; <i>ogles</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, thou art <i>filly</i>, my beloved, <i>any road up</i>, <i>dolly</i>: also our bed is green.
    </li>
    <li>The beams of our <i>lattie</i> are cedar, and our rafters of fir.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.
    </li>
    <li>As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the <i>palone chavvies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the <i>homie chavvies</i>. I sat down under <i>her</i> shadow with <i>dowry</i> delight, and <i>her</i> fruit was <i>bona</i> to my taste.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> brought me to the banqueting <i>lattie</i>, and <i>her</i> banner over me was love.
    </li>
    <li>Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love.
    </li>
    <li><i>Her</i> <i>dry martini</i> is under my <i>eke</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>sweet martini</i> doth embrace me.
    </li>
    <li>I charge you, O ye <i>palone chavvies</i> of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, <i>nishta</i> awake my love, till <i>she</i> please.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>cackling fakement</i> of my beloved! <i>varda</i>, <i>she</i> <i>trolleth</i> leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.
    </li>
    <li>My beloved is like a roe or a <i>bean</i> hart: <i>varda</i>, <i>she</i> standeth behind our wall, <i>she</i> <i>varda-eth</i> forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice.
    </li>
    <li>My beloved <i>cackled</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto me, Rise up, my love, my <i>filly</i> <i>una</i>, and <i>troll</i> away.
    </li>
    <li>For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and <i>trolled</i>;
    </li>
    <li>The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is <i>troll</i>, and the <i>cackling fakement</i> of the turtle is <i>aunt nelled</i> in our land;
    </li>
    <li>The fig tree <i>laueth</i> forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape <i>parker</i> a <i>bona</i> smell. Arise, my love, my <i>filly</i> <i>una</i>, and <i>troll</i> away.
    </li>
    <li>O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me <i>varda</i> thy countenance, let me <i>aunt nell</i> thy <i>cackling fakement</i>; for <i>bona</i> is thy <i>cackling fakement</i>, and thy countenance is comely.
    </li>
    <li><i>Lell</i> us the foxes, the <i>bijou</i> foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes.
    </li>
    <li>My beloved is mine, and I am <i>her</i>: <i>she</i> <i>jarrieth</i> among the lilies.
    </li>
    <li>Until the <i>journo</i> break, and the shadows <i>scarper</i> away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a <i>bean</i> hart upon the mountains of Bether.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>By <i>nochy</i> on my bed I sought <i>her</i> whom my <i>nishta lucoddy</i> loveth: I sought <i>her</i>, but I found <i>her</i> not.
    </li>
    <li>I will rise now, and <i>troll about</i> the <i>smoke</i> in the streets, and in the broad ways I will <i>charper</i> <i>her</i> whom my <i>nishta lucoddy</i> loveth: I sought <i>her</i>, but I found <i>her</i> not.
    </li>
    <li>The watchmen that <i>troll about</i> the <i>smoke</i> found me: to whom I <i>cackled</i>, <i>vardad</i> ye <i>her</i> whom my <i>nishta lucoddy</i> loveth?
    </li>
    <li>It was but a <i>bijou</i> that I passed from them, but I found <i>her</i> whom my <i>nishta lucoddy</i> loveth: I held <i>her</i>, and would not let <i>her</i> <i>troll</i>, until I had brought <i>her</i> into my mother&#8217;s <i>lattie</i>, and into the <i>booth</i> of her that conceived me.
    </li>
    <li>I charge you, O ye <i>palone chavvies</i> of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, <i>nishta</i> awake my love, till <i>she</i> please.
    </li>
    <li>Who is this that <i>trolleth</i> out of the <i>nishta smoke</i> like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the <i>bodega homie</i>?
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i> <i>her</i> bed, which is Solomon&#8217;s; <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> valiant <i>homies</i> are about it, of the valiant of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>They all hold <i>dowry efinks</i>, being expert in <i>barney</i>: every <i>homie</i> hath <i>her</i> <i>dowry efink</i> upon <i>her</i> thigh because of fear in the <i>nochy</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Dowriest homie</i> Solomon made himself a <i>trundling cheat</i> of the wood of Lebanon.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of <i>gelt</i>, the covering of it of purple, the midst thereof being paved with love, for the <i>palone chavvies</i> of Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li><i>Troll forth</i>, O ye <i>palone chavvies</i> of Zion, and <i>varda</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon with the <i>mudge</i> wherewith <i>her</i> mother crowned <i>her</i> in the <i>journo</i> of <i>her</i> espousals, and in the <i>journo</i> of the gladness of <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, thou art <i>filly</i>, my love; <i>varda</i>, thou art <i>filly</i>; thou hast doves&#8217; <i>ogles</i> within thy locks: thy <i>riah</i> is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.
    </li>
    <li>Thy <i>hampsteads</i> are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which <i>trolled</i> up from the washing; whereof every <i>una</i> bear twins, and none is barren among them.
    </li>
    <li>Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy <i>cackle</i> is comely: thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.
    </li>
    <li>Thy neck is like the tower of <i>Davina</i> builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a <i>mille</i> bucklers, all shields of <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thy <i>dewey</i> <i>foofs</i> are like <i>dewey</i> <i>bean</i> roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies.
    </li>
    <li>Until the <i>journo</i> break, and the shadows <i>scarper</i> away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.
    </li>
    <li>Thou art all <i>filly</i>, my love; there is no spot in thee.
    </li>
    <li><i>Troll</i> with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon: <i>varda</i> from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions&#8217; dens, from the mountains of the leopards.
    </li>
    <li>Thou hast ravished my <i>thumping cheat</i>, my sister, my spouse; thou hast ravished my <i>thumping cheat</i> with <i>una</i> of thine <i>ogles</i>, with <i>una</i> chain of thy neck.
    </li>
    <li>How <i>filly</i> is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how <i>dowry</i> <i>benar</i> is thy love than <i>sherry</i>! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!
    </li>
    <li>Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb: honey and milk are under thy <i>polari</i>; and the smell of thy <i>frocks</i> is like the smell of Lebanon.
    </li>
    <li>A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.
    </li>
    <li>Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with <i>dolly</i> fruits; camphire, with spikenard,
    </li>
    <li>Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the <i>dowriest</i> spices:
    </li>
    <li>A fountain of gardens, a well of living <i>aquas</i>, and streams from Lebanon.
    </li>
    <li>Awake, O north wind; and <i>troll</i>, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved <i>troll</i> into <i>her</i> garden, and <i>jarry</i> <i>her</i> <i>dolly</i> fruits.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>I am <i>troll</i> into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have <i>jarried</i> my honeycomb with my honey; I have <i>bevvied</i> my <i>sherry</i> with my milk: <i>jarry</i>, O <i>bencoves</i>; <i>buvare</i>, <i>any road up</i>, <i>buvare</i> <i>dowrily</i>, O beloved.
    </li>
    <li>I <i>letty</i>, but my <i>thumping cheat</i> waketh: it is the <i>cackling fakement</i> of my beloved that knocketh, <i>cackling</i>, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my <i>eke</i> is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the <i>nochy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have <i>dhobied</i> my <i>plates</i>; how shall I defile them?
    </li>
    <li>My beloved put in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> by the hole of the door, and my <i>chutney locker</i> were <i>trolled</i> for <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I rose up to open to my beloved; and my <i>fambles</i> dropped with myrrh, and my <i>luppers</i> with <i>bona</i> smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.
    </li>
    <li>I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was <i>trolled</i>: my <i>nishta lucoddy</i> failed when <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>: I sought <i>her</i>, but I could not find <i>her</i>; I <i>screeched</i> <i>her</i>, but <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> me no answer.
    </li>
    <li>The watchmen that <i>trolled</i> about the <i>smoke</i> found me, they <i>slapped</i> me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls <i>lelled</i> away my veil from me.
    </li>
    <li>I charge you, O <i>palone chavvies</i> of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye <i>cackle</i> <i>her</i>, that I am sick of love.
    </li>
    <li>What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among <i>palones</i>? what is thy beloved more than another beloved, that thou dost so charge us?
    </li>
    <li>My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among <i>dacha</i> <i>mille</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Her</i> <i>eke</i> is as the most <i>bona</i> <i>gelt</i>, <i>her</i> locks are bushy, and <i>goolie</i> as a raven.
    </li>
    <li><i>Her</i> <i>ogles</i> are as the <i>ogles</i> of doves by the rivers of <i>aquas</i>, <i>dhobied</i> with milk, and fitly set.
    </li>
    <li><i>Her</i> cheeks are as a bed of spices, as <i>bona</i> flowers: <i>her</i> lips like lilies, dropping <i>bona</i> smelling myrrh.
    </li>
    <li><i>Her</i> <i>fambles</i> are as <i>gelt</i> <i>famble cheats</i> set with the beryl: <i>her</i> belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires.
    </li>
    <li><i>Her</i> <i>scotches</i> are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of <i>bona</i> <i>gelt</i>: <i>her</i> countenance is as Lebanon, <i>fantabulosa</i> as the cedars.
    </li>
    <li><i>Her</i> <i>screech</i> is most <i>bona</i>: <i>any road up</i>, <i>she</i> is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my <i>bencove</i>, O <i>palone chavvies</i> of Jerusalem.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Whither is thy beloved <i>trolled</i>, O thou fairest among <i>palones</i>? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may <i>charper</i> <i>her</i> with thee.
    </li>
    <li>My beloved is <i>trolled</i> down into <i>her</i> garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
    </li>
    <li>I am my beloved&#8217;s, and my beloved is mine: <i>she</i> <i>jarrieth</i> among the lilies.
    </li>
    <li>Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, <i>nanna</i> as an army with banners.
    </li>
    <li>Turn away thine <i>ogles</i> from me, for they have overcome me: thy <i>riah</i> is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.
    </li>
    <li>Thy <i>hampsteads</i> are as a flock of sheep which <i>troll</i> up from the washing, whereof every <i>una</i> beareth twins, and there is not <i>una</i> barren among them.
    </li>
    <li>As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks.
    </li>
    <li>There are <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> <i>dowriest palones</i>, and fourscore concubines, and <i>nanti charvers</i> <i>nanti</i> number.
    </li>
    <li>My dove, my undefiled is but <i>una</i>; she is the only <i>una</i> of her mother, she is the choice <i>una</i> of her that bare her. The <i>palone chavvies</i> <i>vardad</i> her, and <i>fabed</i> her; <i>any road up</i>, the <i>dowriest palones</i> and the concubines, and they praised her.
    </li>
    <li>Who is she that <i>varda-eth</i> forth as the morning, <i>filly</i> as the moon, clear as the sun, and <i>nanna</i> as an army with banners?
    </li>
    <li>I <i>trolled</i> down into the garden of nuts to <i>varda</i> the fruits of the valley, and to <i>varda</i> whether the vine flourished and the pomegranates budded.
    </li>
    <li>Or ever I was aware, my <i>nishta lucoddy</i> made me like the <i>rattling coves</i> of Amminadib.
    </li>
    <li>Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may <i>varda</i> upon thee. What will ye <i>varda</i> in the Shulamite? As it were the company of <i>dewey</i> armies.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>How beautiful are thy <i>plates</i> with <i>slingbacks</i>, O <i>princess</i>&#8216;s <i>palone chavvie</i>! the joints of thy thighs are like <i>groinage</i>, the <i>acting dickey</i> of the <i>fambles</i> of a cunning workman.
    </li>
    <li>Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies.
    </li>
    <li>Thy <i>dewey</i> <i>foofs</i> are like <i>dewey</i> <i>bean</i> roes that are twins.
    </li>
    <li>Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine <i>ogles</i> like the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which <i>varda-eth</i> toward Damascus.
    </li>
    <li>Thine <i>eke</i> upon thee is like Carmel, and the <i>riah</i> of thine <i>eke</i> like purple; the <i>dowriest homie</i> is held in the galleries.
    </li>
    <li>How <i>filly</i> and how <i>dolly</i> art thou, O love, for delights!
    </li>
    <li>This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy <i>foofs</i> to clusters of grapes.
    </li>
    <li>I <i>cackled</i>, I will <i>troll</i> up to the palm tree, I will <i>lell</i> hold of the boughs thereof: now also thy <i>foofs</i> shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples;
    </li>
    <li>And the roof of thy <i>screech</i> like the best <i>sherry</i> for my beloved, that goeth down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to <i>cackle</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I am my beloved&#8217;s, and <i>her</i> <i>fancy</i> is toward me.
    </li>
    <li><i>Troll</i>, my beloved, let us <i>troll forth</i> into the field; let us lodge in the villages.
    </li>
    <li>Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us <i>varda</i> if the vine flourish, whether the tender grape appear, and the pomegranates bud forth: there will I <i>parker</i> thee my loves.
    </li>
    <li>The mandrakes <i>parker</i> a smell, and at our gates are all manner of <i>dolly</i> fruits, new and <i>badge</i>, which I have <i>laued</i> up for thee, O my beloved.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>O that thou wert as my <i>sister</i>, that sucked the <i>foofs</i> of my mother! when I should find thee <i>nanti</i>, I would kiss thee; <i>any road up</i>, I should not be despised.
    </li>
    <li>I would lead thee, and <i>parker</i> thee into my mother&#8217;s <i>lattie</i>, who would instruct me: I would cause thee to <i>buvare</i> of spiced <i>sherry</i> of the juice of my pomegranate.
    </li>
    <li><i>Her</i> <i>dry martini</i> should be under my <i>eke</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>sweet martini</i> should embrace me.
    </li>
    <li>I charge you, O <i>palone chavvies</i> of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, <i>nishta</i> awake my love, until <i>she</i> please.
    </li>
    <li>Who is this that <i>trolleth</i> up from the <i>nishta smoke</i>, leaning upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth that bare thee.
    </li>
    <li>Set me as a seal upon thine <i>thumping cheat</i>, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is <i>butch</i> as <i>carking it</i>; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of <i>binco fakement</i>, which hath a most vehement flame.
    </li>
    <li>Many <i>aquas</i> cannot quench love, <i>nishta</i> can the <i>dowry aquas</i> drown it: if a <i>homie</i> would <i>parker</i> all the substance of <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i> for love, it would utterly be contemned.
    </li>
    <li>We have a <i>bijou</i> sister, and she hath no <i>foofs</i>: what shall we do for our sister in the <i>journo</i> when she shall be <i>cackled</i> for?
    </li>
    <li>If she be a wall, we will build upon her a <i>dowry lattie</i> of silver: and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.
    </li>
    <li>I am a wall, and my <i>foofs</i> like towers: then was I in <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i> as <i>una</i> that found favour.
    </li>
    <li>Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; <i>she</i> let out the vineyard unto keepers; every <i>una</i> for the fruit thereof was to <i>parker</i> a <i>mille</i> pieces of silver.
    </li>
    <li>My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon, must have a <i>mille</i>, and those that keep the fruit thereof <i>dewey</i> <i>chenter</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions <i>aunt nell</i> to thy <i>cackling fakement</i>: cause me to <i>aunt nell</i> it.
    </li>
    <li>Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a <i>bean</i> hart upon the mountains of spices.
