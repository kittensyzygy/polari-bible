    <h1>Zechariah</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>In the <i>otterth</i> month, in the second year of Darius, <i>trolled</i> the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> unto Zechariah, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Berechiah, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Iddo the prophet, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> hath been sore displeased with your <i>aunties</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore <i>cackle</i> thou unto them, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts; Turn ye unto me, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts, and I will turn unto you, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts.
    </li>
    <li>Be ye not as your <i>aunties</i>, unto whom the former prophets have <i>screeched</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts; Turn ye now from your <i>nana</i> ways, and from your <i>nana</i> doings: but they did not <i>aunt nell</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>aunt nell</i> unto me, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Your <i>aunties</i>, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?
    </li>
    <li>But my <i>lavs</i> and my <i>dowry lavs</i>, which I commanded my <i>serving homies</i> the prophets, did they not <i>lell</i> hold of your <i>aunties</i>? and they <i>trolled back</i> and <i>cackled</i>, Like as the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath <i>she</i> dealt with us.
    </li>
    <li>Upon the <i>quarter</i> and <i>dewey dachath</i> <i>journo</i> of the eleventh month, which is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, <i>trolled</i> the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> unto Zechariah, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Berechiah, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Iddo the prophet, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>I <i>vardad</i> by <i>nochy</i>, and <i>varda</i> a <i>homie</i> riding upon a red horse, and <i>she</i> stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom; and behind <i>her</i> were there red horses, speckled, and white.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> I, O my <i>Duchess</i>, what are these? And the <i>fairy</i> that talked with me <i>cackled</i> unto me, I will shew thee what these be.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>homie</i> that stood among the myrtle trees answered and <i>cackled</i>, These are they whom the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>laued</i> to <i>mince</i> to and fro through the earth.
    </li>
    <li>And they answered the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> that stood among the myrtle trees, and <i>cackled</i>, We have <i>minced</i> to and fro through the earth, and, <i>varda</i>, all the earth sitteth still, and is at <i>lettie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> answered and <i>cackled</i>, O <i>Duchess</i> of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the <i>smokes</i> of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> and <i>dacha</i> years?
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> answered the <i>fairy</i> that talked with me with <i>bona</i> <i>lavs</i> and comfortable <i>lavs</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So the <i>fairy</i> that <i>dished the dirt</i> with me <i>cackled</i> unto me, <i>screech</i> thou, <i>cackling</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a <i>dowry</i> jealousy.
    </li>
    <li>And I am <i>dowry</i> sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease: for I was but a <i>bijou</i> displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>; I am <i>trolled back to</i> Jerusalem with mercies: my <i>lattie</i> shall be built in it, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li><i>Screech</i> yet, <i>cackling</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts; My <i>smokes</i> through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the <i>Duchess</i> shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>Then lifted I up mine <i>ogles</i>, and <i>vardad</i>, and <i>varda</i> <i>quarter</i> <i>colins</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>fairy</i> that talked with me, What be these? And <i>she</i> answered me, These are the <i>colins</i> which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> shewed me <i>quarter</i> carpenters.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> I, What <i>troll</i> these to do? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>cackling</i>, These are the <i>colins</i> which have scattered Judah, so that no <i>homie</i> did lift up <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>: but these are <i>troll</i> to fray them, to cast out the <i>colins</i> of the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>, which lifted up their <i>colin</i> over the land of Judah to scatter it.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>I lifted up mine <i>ogles</i> again, and looked, and <i>varda</i> a <i>homie</i> with a measuring line in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> I, Whither <i>trollest</i> thou? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to <i>varda</i> what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.
    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, the <i>fairy</i> that talked with me <i>trolled</i> forth, and another <i>fairy</i> <i>trolled</i> out to meet <i>her</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Run, <i>cackle</i> to this <i>bean cove</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns <i>nanti</i> walls for the multitude of <i>homies</i> and cattle therein:
    </li>
    <li>For I, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, will be unto her a wall of <i>binco fakement</i> round about, and will be the <i>fabeness</i> in the midst of her.
    </li>
    <li>Ho, ho, <i>troll</i> forth, and <i>scarper</i> from the land of the north, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>: for I have spread you abroad as the <i>quarter</i> winds of the heaven, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest with the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Babylon.
    </li>
    <li>For thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts; After the <i>fabeness</i> hath <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> me unto the nations which spoiled you: for <i>she</i> that <i>reefeth</i> you <i>reefeth</i> the apple of <i>her</i> <i>ogle</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For, <i>varda</i>, I will shake mine <i>famble</i> upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their <i>serving homies</i>: and ye shall know that the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts hath <i>laued</i> me.
    </li>
    <li>Sing and rejoice, O <i>palone chavvie</i> of Zion: for, lo, I <i>troll</i>, and I will <i>lett</i> in the midst of thee, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And many nations shall be joined to the <i>Duchess</i> in that <i>journo</i>, and shall be my <i>homies and palones</i>: and I will <i>lett</i> in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts hath <i>laued</i> me unto thee.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> shall inherit Judah <i>her</i> portion in the <i>fabulosa</i> land, and shall choose Jerusalem again.
    </li>
    <li>Be silent, O all flesh, before the <i>Duchess</i>: for <i>she</i> is raised up out of <i>her</i> <i>fabulosa</i> habitation.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And <i>she</i> shewed me Joshua the high <i>godly homie</i> standing before the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>Sadie</i> standing at <i>her</i> <i>sweet martini</i> to resist <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Sadie</i>, The <i>Duchess</i> rebuke thee, O <i>Sadie</i>; even the <i>Duchess</i> that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the <i>binco fakement</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Now Joshua was clothed with <i>manky</i> <i>frocks</i>, and stood before the <i>fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> answered and <i>cackled</i> unto those that stood before <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>lell</i> away the <i>manky</i> <i>frocks</i> from <i>her</i>. And unto <i>her</i> <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, I have caused thine <i>codness</i> to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of <i>clobber</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>cackled</i>, Let them set a <i>filly</i> mitre upon <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>. So they set a <i>filly</i> mitre upon <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>, and clothed <i>her</i> with <i>frocks</i>. And the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> stood by.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> protested unto Joshua, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts; If thou wilt <i>mince</i> in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also <i>beak</i> my <i>lattie</i>, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will <i>parker</i> thee places to <i>mince</i> among these that stand by.
    </li>
    <li><i>Aunt nell</i> now, O Joshua the high <i>godly homie</i>, thou, and thy fellows that <i>lett</i> before thee: for they are <i>homies</i> wondered at: for, <i>varda</i>, I will <i>parker</i> forth my <i>serving homie</i> the BRANCH.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>varda</i> the stone that I have <i>laued</i> before Joshua; upon <i>una</i> stone shall be <i>setter</i> <i>ogles</i>: <i>varda</i>, I will engrave the graving thereof, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts, and I will remove the <i>codness</i> of that land in <i>una</i> <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>In that <i>journo</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts, shall ye <i>screech</i> every <i>homie</i> <i>her</i> <i>homie ajax</i> under the vine and under the fig tree.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And the <i>fairy</i> that talked with me <i>trolled</i> again, and waked me, as a <i>homie</i> that is wakened out of <i>her</i> <i>letty</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackled</i> unto me, What <i>vardest</i> thou? And I <i>cackled</i>, I have looked, and <i>varda</i> a candlestick all of <i>gelt</i>, with a bowl upon the top of it, and <i>her</i> <i>setter</i> <i>bincos</i> thereon, and <i>setter</i> pipes to the <i>setter</i> <i>bincos</i>, which are upon the top thereof:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>dewey</i> olive trees by it, <i>una</i> upon the <i>sweet</i> side of the bowl, and the other upon the <i>dry</i> side thereof.
    </li>
    <li>So I answered and <i>cackled</i> to the <i>fairy</i> that talked with me, <i>cackling</i>, What are these, my <i>Duchess</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>fairy</i> that talked with me answered and <i>cackled</i> unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I <i>cackled</i>, No, my <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>she</i> answered and <i>cackled</i> unto me, <i>cackling</i>, This is the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> unto Zerubbabel, <i>cackling</i>, Not by might, <i>nishta</i> by power, but by my <i>Fairy</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts.
    </li>
    <li>Who art thou, O <i>dowry</i> mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain: and <i>she</i> shall <i>parker</i> forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, <i>screeching</i>, <i>gracie</i>, <i>gracie</i> unto it.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> unto me, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>The <i>fambles</i> of Zerubbabel have <i>laued</i> the foundation of this <i>lattie</i>; <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i> shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts hath <i>laued</i> me unto you.
    </li>
    <li>For who hath despised the <i>journo</i> of <i>pogey</i> <i>fakements</i>? for they shall rejoice, and shall <i>varda</i> the plummet in the <i>famble</i> of Zerubbabel with those <i>setter</i>; they are the <i>ogles</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, which run to and fro through the whole earth.
    </li>
    <li>Then answered I, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, What are these <i>dewey</i> olive trees upon the <i>sweet</i> side of the candlestick and upon the <i>dry</i> side thereof?
    </li>
    <li>And I answered again, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, What be these <i>dewey</i> olive branches which through the <i>dewey</i> golden pipes empty the golden <i>lube</i> out of themselves?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> answered me and <i>cackled</i>, Knowest thou not what these be? And I <i>cackled</i>, No, my <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i>, These are the <i>dewey</i> anointed ones, that stand by the <i>Duchess</i> of the whole earth.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Then I turned, and lifted up mine <i>ogles</i>, and looked, and <i>varda</i> a flying roll.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, What <i>vardest</i> thou? And I answered, I <i>varda</i> a flying roll; the length thereof is <i>dewey dacha</i> cubits, and the breadth thereof <i>dacha</i> cubits.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i> unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the <i>eke</i> of the whole earth: for every <i>una</i> that stealeth shall be cut off as on this side according to it; and every <i>una</i> that sweareth shall be cut off as on that side according to it.
    </li>
    <li>I will <i>parker</i> it forth, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts, and it shall enter into the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>sharpering homie</i>, and into the <i>lattie</i> of <i>her</i> that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>fairy</i> that talked with me <i>trolled</i> forth, and <i>cackled</i> unto me, Lift up now thine <i>ogles</i>, and <i>varda</i> what is this that goeth forth.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>cackled</i>, What is it? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, This is an ephah that goeth forth. <i>She</i> <i>cackled</i> moreover, This is their resemblance through all the earth.
    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this is a <i>palone</i> that sitteth in the midst of the ephah.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, This is <i>naffness</i>. And <i>she</i> cast it into the midst of the ephah; and <i>she</i> cast the weight of lead upon the <i>screech</i> thereof.
    </li>
    <li>Then lifted I up mine <i>ogles</i>, and looked, and, <i>varda</i>, there <i>trolled</i> out <i>dewey</i> <i>palones</i>, and the wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> I to the <i>fairy</i> that talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, To build it an <i>lattie</i> in the land of Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her own base.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And I turned, and lifted up mine <i>ogles</i>, and looked, and, <i>varda</i>, there <i>trolled</i> <i>quarter</i> <i>rattling coves</i> out from between <i>dewey</i> mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass.
    </li>
    <li>In the first <i>trundling cheat</i> were red horses; and in the second <i>trundling cheat</i> <i>goolie</i> horses;
    </li>
    <li>And in the third <i>trundling cheat</i> white horses; and in the <i>quarter</i> <i>trundling cheat</i> grisled and bay horses.
    </li>
    <li>Then I answered and <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>fairy</i> that talked with me, What are these, my <i>Duchess</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>fairy</i> answered and <i>cackled</i> unto me, These are the <i>quarter</i> <i>fairies</i> of the heavens, which <i>troll forth</i> from standing before the <i>Duchess</i> of all the earth.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>goolie</i> horses which are therein <i>troll forth</i> into the north country; and the white <i>troll forth</i> after them; and the grisled <i>troll forth</i> toward the south country.
    </li>
    <li>And the bay <i>trolled</i> forth, and sought to <i>troll</i> that they might <i>mince</i> to and fro through the earth: and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Get you hence, <i>mince</i> to and fro through the earth. So they <i>minced</i> to and fro through the earth.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>screeched</i> <i>she</i> upon me, and <i>cackled</i> unto me, <i>cackling</i>, <i>varda</i>, these that <i>troll</i> toward the north country have quieted my <i>Fairy</i> in the north country.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> unto me, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Lell</i> of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, which are <i>troll</i> from Babylon, and <i>troll</i> thou the same <i>journo</i>, and <i>troll</i> into the <i>lattie</i> of Josiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Zephaniah;
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>lell</i> silver and <i>gelt</i>, and make crowns, and set them upon the <i>eke</i> of Joshua the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Josedech, the high <i>godly homie</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackle</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts, <i>cackling</i>, <i>varda</i> the <i>homie</i> whose name is The BRANCH; and <i>she</i> shall grow up out of <i>her</i> place, and <i>she</i> shall build the <i>holy carsey</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Even <i>she</i> shall build the <i>holy carsey</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>; and <i>she</i> shall bear the <i>fabeness</i>, and shall <i>lett</i> and rule upon <i>her</i> throne; and <i>she</i> shall be a <i>godly homie</i> upon <i>her</i> throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.
    </li>
    <li>And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the <i>holy carsey</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they that are far off shall <i>troll</i> and build in the <i>holy carsey</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and ye shall know that the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts hath <i>laued</i> me unto you. And this shall <i>troll</i> to pass, if ye will diligently obey the <i>cackling fakement</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> in the <i>quarter</i> year of <i>dowriest homie</i> Darius, that the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> unto Zechariah in the <i>quarter</i> <i>journo</i> of the ninth month, even in Chisleu;
    </li>
    <li>When they had <i>laued</i> unto the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> Sherezer and Regemmelech, and their <i>homies</i>, to pray before the <i>Duchess</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And to <i>cackle</i> unto the <i>godly homies</i> which were in the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts, and to the prophets, <i>cackling</i>, Should I <i>parnie</i> in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>trolled</i> the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts unto me, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackle</i> unto all the <i>homies and palones</i> of the land, and to the <i>godly homies</i>, <i>cackling</i>, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and <i>setterth</i> month, even those <i>setter dacha</i> years, did ye at all <i>nishta manjarry</i> unto me, even to me?
    </li>
    <li>And when ye did <i>jarry</i>, and when ye did <i>buvare</i>, did not ye <i>jarry</i> for yourselves, and <i>buvare</i> for yourselves?
    </li>
    <li>Should ye not <i>aunt nell</i> the <i>lavs</i> which the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>screeched</i> by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the <i>smokes</i> thereof round about her, when <i>homies</i> inhabited the south and the plain?
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> unto Zechariah, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts, <i>cackling</i>, Execute true judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every <i>homie</i> to <i>her</i> <i>sister</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And oppress not the widow, <i>nishta</i> the fatherless, the stranger, <i>nishta</i> the <i>nanti dinarly</i>; and let none of you imagine <i>nana</i> against <i>her</i> <i>sister</i> in your <i>thumping cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But they refused to <i>aunt nell</i>, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their <i>aunt nelly cheats</i>, that they should not <i>aunt nell</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, they made their <i>thumping cheats</i> as an adamant stone, lest they should <i>aunt nell</i> the law, and the <i>lavs</i> which the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts hath <i>laued</i> in <i>her</i> <i>Fairy</i> by the former prophets: therefore <i>trolled</i> a <i>dowry</i> wrath from the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore it is <i>troll</i> to pass, that as <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i>, and they would not <i>aunt nell</i>; so they <i>screeched</i>, and I would not <i>aunt nell</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts:
    </li>
    <li>But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no <i>homie</i> passed through <i>nishta</i> <i>trolled back</i>: for they <i>laued</i> the <i>dolly</i> land desolate.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Again the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts <i>trolled</i> to me, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with <i>dowry</i> jealousy, and I was jealous for her with <i>dowry</i> fury.
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>; I am <i>trolled back</i> unto Zion, and will <i>lett</i> in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be <i>screeched</i> a <i>smoke</i> of truth; and the mountain of the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts the <i>fabulosa</i> mountain.
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts; There shall yet <i>badge coves</i> and <i>badge</i> <i>palones</i> <i>lett</i> in the streets of Jerusalem, and every <i>homie</i> with <i>her</i> <i>trolling fakement</i> in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> for <i>dowry</i> age.
    </li>
    <li>And the streets of the <i>smoke</i> shall be full of <i>filiomes</i> and girls playing in the streets thereof.
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts; If it be marvellous in the <i>ogles</i> of the remnant of this <i>homies and palones</i> in these days, should it also be marvellous in mine <i>ogles</i>? <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts.
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts; <i>varda</i>, I will save my <i>homies and palones</i> from the east country, and from the west country;
    </li>
    <li>And I will <i>parker</i> them, and they shall <i>lett</i> in the midst of Jerusalem: and they shall be my <i>homies and palones</i>, and I will be their <i>Gloria</i>, <i>no flies</i> and in <i>bonaness</i>.
    </li>

    <li>So again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the <i>lattie</i> of Judah: fear ye not.

    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts; It shall yet <i>troll</i> to pass, that there shall <i>troll</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, and the inhabitants of many <i>smokes</i>:

    <li>And the inhabitants of <i>una</i> <i>smoke</i> shall <i>troll</i> to another, <i>cackling</i>, Let us <i>troll</i> speedily to pray before the <i>Duchess</i>, and to <i>charper</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts: I will <i>troll</i> also.

    <li><i>Any road up</i>, many <i>homies and palones</i> and <i>butch</i> nations shall <i>troll</i> to <i>charper</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the <i>Duchess</i>.

    <li>Mine <i>wild</i> was kindled against the shepherds, and I <i>zsa zsa-ed</i> the goats: for the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts hath visited <i>her</i> flock the <i>lattie</i> of Judah, and hath made them as <i>her</i> goodly horse in the battle.

    <li>There is a <i>cackling fakement</i> of the howling of the shepherds; for their <i>fabeness</i> is spoiled: a <i>cackling fakement</i> of the <i>butch shrieking</i> of <i>bean</i> lions; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled.
