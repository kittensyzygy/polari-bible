    <li>Now in the first year of Cyrus <i>dowriest homie</i> of Persia, that the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> by the <i>screech</i> of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the <i>Duchess</i> stirred up the <i>Fairy</i> of Cyrus <i>dowriest homie</i> of Persia, that <i>she</i> made a proclamation throughout all <i>her</i> kingdom, and put it also in <i>screeving</i>, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> Cyrus <i>dowriest homie</i> of Persia, The <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of heaven hath <i>parkered</i> me all the kingdoms of the earth; and <i>she</i> hath charged me to build <i>her</i> an <i>lattie</i> at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
    </li>
    <li>Who is there among you of all <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>? <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i> be with <i>her</i>, and let <i>her</i> <i>troll</i> up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, (<i>she</i> is the <i>Gloria</i>,) which is in Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And whosoever remaineth in any place where <i>she</i> <i>trolleth</i>, let the <i>homies</i> of <i>her</i> place help <i>her</i> with silver, and with <i>gelt</i>, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill <i>parkering</i> for the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> that is in Jerusalem.

    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And when the <i>setterth</i> month was <i>troll</i>, and the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel were in the <i>smokes</i>, the <i>homies and palones</i> gathered themselves together as <i>una</i> <i>homie</i> to Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>Then stood up Jeshua the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jozadak, and <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i> the <i>godly homies</i>, and Zerubbabel the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Shealtiel, and <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, and builded the <i>grovelling fakement</i> of the <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, to offer burnt <i>parkerings</i> thereon, as it is <i>screeved</i> in the law of <i>Maureen</i> the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they set the <i>grovelling fakement</i> upon <i>her</i> bases; for fear was upon them because of the <i>homies and palones</i> of those countries: and they offered burnt <i>parkerings</i> thereon unto the <i>Duchess</i>, even burnt <i>parkerings</i> morning and <i>bijou nochy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>They kept also the <i>dowry munjarlee</i> of <i>bijoux tabernaclettes</i>, as it is <i>screeved</i>, and offered the daily burnt <i>parkerings</i> by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every <i>journo</i> required;
    </li>
    <li>And afterward offered the continual burnt <i>parkering</i>, both of the new moons, and of all the set <i>dowry munjarlees</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> that were consecrated, and of every <i>una</i> that willingly offered a freewill <i>parkering</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>From the first <i>journo</i> of the <i>setterth</i> month began they to offer burnt <i>parkerings</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>. But the foundation of the <i>holy carsey</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> was not yet <i>laued</i>.
    </li>
    <li>They <i>parkered</i> <i>dinarly</i> also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and <i>carnish</i>, and <i>buvare</i>, and <i>lube</i>, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to <i>parker</i> cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus <i>dowriest homie</i> of Persia.
    </li>
    <li>Now in the second year of their <i>trolling</i> unto the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jozadak, and the remnant of their <i>sisters</i> the <i>godly homies</i> and the Levites, and all they that were <i>troll</i> out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from <i>dewey dacha</i> years <i>badge</i> and upward, to set forward the <i>acting dickey</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then stood Jeshua with <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> and <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, Kadmiel and <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>, the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>: the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Henadad, with their <i>homie chavvies</i> and their <i>sisters</i> the Levites.
    </li>
    <li>And when the builders <i>laued</i> the foundation of the <i>holy carsey</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, they set the <i>godly homies</i> in their <i>schmutter</i> with trumpets, and the Levites the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the <i>Duchess</i>, after the ordinance of <i>Davina</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the <i>Duchess</i>; because <i>she</i> is <i>bona</i>, for <i>her</i> mercy endureth for ever toward Israel. And all the <i>homies and palones</i> shouted with a <i>dowry</i> <i>screech</i>, when they praised the <i>Duchess</i>, because the foundation of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> was <i>laued</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But many of the <i>godly homies</i> and Levites and <i>dowriest</i> of the <i>aunties</i>, who were ancient <i>homies</i>, that had <i>vardad</i> the first <i>lattie</i>, when the foundation of this <i>lattie</i> was <i>laued</i> before their <i>ogles</i>, <i>parnied</i> with a loud <i>cackling fakement</i>; and many shouted aloud for joy:
    </li>
    <li>So that the <i>homies and palones</i> could not discern the <i>screech</i> of the <i>screech</i> of joy from the <i>screech</i> of the weeping of the <i>homies and palones</i>: for the <i>homies and palones</i> shouted with a loud <i>screech</i>, and the <i>screech</i> was <i>aunt nelled</i> <i>nishta ajax</i> off.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin <i>aunt nelled</i> that the <i>chavvies</i> of the captivity builded the <i>holy carsey</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel;
    </li>
    <li>Then they <i>trolled</i> to Zerubbabel, and to the <i>dowriest</i> of the <i>aunties</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto them, Let us build with you: for we <i>charper</i> your <i>Gloria</i>, as ye do; and we do <i>parker</i> unto <i>her</i> since the days of Esarhaddon <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assur, which brought us up hither.
    </li>
    <li>But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the <i>lettie</i> of the <i>dowriest</i> of the <i>aunties</i> of Israel, <i>cackled</i> unto them, Ye have <i>nishter</i> to do with us to build an <i>lattie</i> unto our <i>Gloria</i>; but we ourselves together will build unto the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, as <i>dowriest homie</i> Cyrus the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Persia hath commanded us.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>homies and palones</i> of the land weakened the <i>fambles</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i> of Judah, and troubled them in building,
    </li>
    <li>And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus <i>dowriest homie</i> of Persia, even until the reign of Darius <i>dowriest homie</i> of Persia.
    </li>
    <li>And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of <i>her</i> reign, <i>screeved</i> they unto <i>her</i> an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And in the days of Artaxerxes <i>screeved</i> Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the <i>lettie</i> of their companions, unto Artaxerxes <i>dowriest homie</i> of Persia; and the <i>screeving</i> of the letter was <i>screeved</i> in the Syrian <i>polari</i>, and interpreted in the Syrian <i>polari</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe <i>screeved</i> a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the <i>dowriest homie</i> in this sort:
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>screeved</i> Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the <i>lettie</i> of their companions; the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, and the Elamites,
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>lettie</i> of the nations whom the <i>dowry</i> and noble Asnapper brought over, and set in the <i>smokes</i> of Samaria, and the <i>lettie</i> that are on this side the river, and at such a time.
    </li>
    <li>This is the copy of the letter that they <i>laued</i> unto <i>her</i>, even unto Artaxerxes the <i>dowriest homie</i>; Thy <i>serving homies</i> the <i>homies</i> on this side the river, and at such a time.
    </li>
    <li>Be it known unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>, that the <i>kosher homies</i> which <i>trolled</i> up from thee to us are <i>troll</i> unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the <i>cod</i> <i>smoke</i>, and have set up the walls thereof, and joined the foundations.
    </li>
    <li>Be it known now unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>, that, if this <i>smoke</i> be builded, and the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the <i>dowriest homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now because we have maintenance from the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>dowry lattie</i>, and it was not meet for us to <i>varda</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s dishonour, therefore have we <i>laued</i> and certified the <i>dowriest homie</i>;
    </li>
    <li>That search may be made in the <i>glossy</i> of the records of thy <i>aunties</i>: so shalt thou find in the <i>glossy</i> of the records, and know that this <i>smoke</i> is a rebellious <i>smoke</i>, and hurtful unto <i>dowriest homies</i> and provinces, and that they have <i>trolled</i> sedition within the same of <i>badge</i> time: for which cause was this <i>smoke</i> <i>battyfanged</i>.
    </li>
    <li>We certify the <i>dowriest homie</i> that, if this <i>smoke</i> be builded again, and the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>laued</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the <i>lettie</i> of their companions that <i>lett</i> in Samaria, and unto the <i>lettie</i> beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time.
    </li>
    <li>The letter which ye <i>laued</i> unto us hath been plainly <i>varda the lavs</i> before me.
    </li>
    <li>And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this <i>smoke</i> of <i>badge</i> time hath made insurrection against <i>dowriest homies</i>, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein.
    </li>
    <li>There have been <i>dowry butch</i> <i>dowriest homies</i> also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was <i>parkered</i> unto them.

    <li><i>Parker</i> ye now <i>butch lav</i> to cause these <i>homies</i> to cease, and that this <i>smoke</i> be not builded, until another <i>butch lav</i> shall be <i>parkered</i> from me.
    </li>
    <li><i>Lell</i> heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the <i>dowriest homies</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Now when the copy of <i>dowriest homie</i> Artaxerxes&#8217; letter was <i>varda the lavs</i> before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they <i>trolled</i> up in haste to Jerusalem unto the <i>kosher homies</i>, and made them to cease by force and power.
    </li>
    <li>Then ceased the <i>acting dickey</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> which is at Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius <i>dowriest homie</i> of Persia.

    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Iddo, prophesied unto the <i>kosher homies</i> that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, even unto them.
    </li>
    <li>Then rose up Zerubbabel the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jozadak, and began to build the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> which is at Jerusalem: and with them were the prophets of <i>Gloria</i> helping them.
    </li>
    <li>At the same time <i>trolled</i> to them Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai and their companions, and <i>cackled</i> thus unto them, Who hath commanded you to build this <i>lattie</i>, and to make up this wall?
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> we unto them after this manner, What are the names of the <i>homies</i> that make this building?
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>ogle</i> of their <i>Gloria</i> was upon the <i>fungi</i> of the <i>kosher homies</i>, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter <i>trolled</i> to Darius: and then they <i>trolled back</i> answer by letter concerning this matter.
    </li>
    <li>The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai and <i>her</i> companions the Apharsachites, which were on this side the river, <i>laued</i> unto Darius the <i>dowriest homie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>They <i>laued</i> a letter unto <i>her</i>, wherein was <i>screeved</i> thus; Unto Darius the <i>dowriest homie</i>, all peace.
    </li>
    <li>Be it known unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>, that we <i>trolled</i> into the province of Judea, to the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>dowry</i> <i>Gloria</i>, which is builded with <i>dowry</i> stones, and timber is <i>laued</i> in the walls, and this <i>acting dickey</i> goeth <i>nishta manjarry</i> on, and prospereth in their <i>fambles</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then asked we those <i>fungi</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto them thus, Who commanded you to build this <i>lattie</i>, and to make up these walls?
    </li>
    <li>We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might <i>screeve</i> the names of the <i>homies</i> that were the <i>dowriest</i> of them.
    </li>
    <li>And thus they <i>trolled back</i> us answer, <i>cackling</i>, We are the <i>serving homies</i> of the <i>Gloria</i> of heaven and earth, and build the <i>lattie</i> that was builded these many years ago, which a <i>dowry</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel builded and set up.
    </li>
    <li>But after that our <i>aunties</i> had provoked the <i>Gloria</i> of heaven unto wrath, <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> them into the <i>famble</i> of Nebuchadnezzar the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon, the Chaldean, who <i>battyfanged</i> this <i>lattie</i>, and <i>lelled</i> the <i>homies and palones</i> away into Babylon.
    </li>
    <li>But in the first year of Cyrus the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon the same <i>dowriest homie</i> Cyrus made a decree to build this <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>fakements</i> also of <i>gelt</i> and silver of the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, which Nebuchadnezzar <i>lelled</i> out of the <i>holy carsey</i> that was in Jerusalem, and brought them into the <i>holy carsey</i> of Babylon, those did Cyrus the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>lell</i> out of the <i>holy carsey</i> of Babylon, and they were <i>laued</i> unto <i>una</i>, whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom <i>she</i> had made governor;
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>lell</i> these <i>fakements</i>, <i>troll</i>, carry them into the <i>holy carsey</i> that is in Jerusalem, and let the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> be builded in <i>her</i> place.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>trolled</i> the same Sheshbazzar, and <i>laued</i> the foundation of the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not finished.
    </li>
    <li>Now therefore, if it seem <i>bona</i> to the <i>dowriest homie</i>, let there be search made in the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>gelt</i> <i>lattie</i>, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the <i>dowriest homie</i> to build this <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> at Jerusalem, and let the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>lau</i> <i>her</i> pleasure to us concerning this matter.

    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Then Darius the <i>dowriest homie</i> made a decree, and search was made in the <i>lattie</i> of the rolls, where the <i>gelt</i> were <i>laued</i> up in Babylon.
    </li>
    <li>And there was found at Achmetha, in the <i>dowry lattie</i> that is in the province of the Medes, a roll, and therein was a record thus <i>screeved</i>:
    </li>
    <li>In the first year of Cyrus the <i>dowriest homie</i> the same Cyrus the <i>dowriest homie</i> made a decree concerning the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> at Jerusalem, Let the <i>lattie</i> be builded, the place where they offered <i>parkers</i>, and let the foundations thereof be strongly <i>laued</i>; the height thereof <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> cubits, and the breadth thereof <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> cubits;
    </li>
    <li>With <i>trey</i> rows of <i>dowry</i> stones, and a row of new timber: and let the expenses be <i>parkered</i> out of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And also let the golden and silver <i>fakements</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, which Nebuchadnezzar <i>lelled</i> forth out of the <i>holy carsey</i> which is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the <i>holy carsey</i> which is at Jerusalem, every <i>una</i> to <i>her</i> place, and place them in the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shetharboznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, which are beyond the river, be ye <i>nishter ajax</i> thence:
    </li>
    <li>Let the <i>acting dickey</i> of this <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> alone; let the governor of the <i>kosher homies</i> and the <i>fungi</i> of the <i>kosher homies</i> build this <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> in <i>her</i> place.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the <i>fungi</i> of these <i>kosher homies</i> for the building of this <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>: that of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s goods, even of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expenses be <i>parkered</i> unto these <i>homies</i>, that they be not hindered.
    </li>
    <li>And that which they have need of, both <i>bean</i> bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt <i>parkerings</i> of the <i>Gloria</i> of heaven, wheat, salt, <i>sherry</i>, and <i>lube</i>, according to the appointment of the <i>godly homies</i> which are at Jerusalem, let it be <i>parkered</i> them <i>journo</i> by <i>journo</i> <i>nanti</i> fail:
    </li>
    <li>That they may offer <i>parkers</i> of <i>bona</i> savours unto the <i>Gloria</i> of heaven, and pray for the life of the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and of <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this <i>lav</i>, let timber be pulled down from <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>, and being set up, let <i>her</i> be hanged thereon; and let <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i> be made a dunghill for this.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Gloria</i> that hath caused <i>her</i> name to <i>lett</i> there <i>battyfang</i> all <i>dowriest homies</i> and <i>homies and palones</i>, that shall put to their <i>famble</i> to alter and to <i>battyfang</i> this <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> which is at Jerusalem.

    </li>
    <li>Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shetharboznai, and their companions, according to that which Darius the <i>dowriest homie</i> had <i>laued</i>, so they did speedily.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>fungi</i> of the <i>kosher homies</i> builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Iddo.

    <li>And this <i>lattie</i> was finished on the third <i>journo</i> of the month Adar, which was in the <i>seyth</i> year of the reign of Darius the <i>dowriest homie</i>.

    <li>For I was ashamed to require of the <i>dowriest homie</i> a band of <i>butch homies</i> and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>, <i>cackling</i>, The <i>famble</i> of our <i>Gloria</i> is upon all them for <i>bona</i> that <i>charper</i> <i>her</i>; but <i>her</i> power and <i>her</i> wrath is against all them that forsake <i>her</i>.

    <li><i>Varda</i> ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the <i>dowriest</i> of the <i>godly homies</i> and the Levites, and <i>dowriest</i> of the <i>aunties</i> of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So <i>lelled</i> the <i>godly homies</i> and the Levites the weight of the silver, and the <i>gelt</i>, and the <i>fakements</i>, to <i>parker</i> them to Jerusalem unto the <i>lattie</i> of our <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then we <i>trolled off</i> from the river of Ahava on the twelfth <i>journo</i> of the first month, to <i>troll</i> unto Jerusalem: and the <i>famble</i> of our <i>Gloria</i> was upon us, and <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> us from the <i>famble</i> of the enemy, and of such as <i>lett</i> in wait by the way.
    </li>
    <li>And we <i>trolled</i> to Jerusalem, and <i>letted</i> there <i>trey</i> days.
    </li>
    <li>Now on the <i>quarter</i> <i>journo</i> was the silver and the <i>gelt</i> and the <i>fakements</i> weighed in the <i>lattie</i> of our <i>Gloria</i> by the <i>famble</i> of Meremoth the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Uriah the <i>godly homie</i>; and with <i>her</i> was Eleazar the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jeshua, and Noadiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Binnui, Levites;
    </li>
    <li>By number and by weight of every <i>una</i>: and all the weight was <i>screeved</i> at that time.
    </li>
    <li>Also the <i>chavvies</i> of those that had been <i>lelled</i> away, which were <i>troll</i> out of the captivity, offered burnt <i>parkerings</i> unto the <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, <i>kenza</i> bullocks for all Israel, <i>nobber dacha</i> and <i>sey</i> rams, <i>setter dacha</i> and <i>setter</i> lambs, <i>kenza</i> <i>she</i> goats for a <i>kertever</i> <i>parkering</i>: all this was a burnt <i>parkering</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>laued</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s commissions unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they furthered the <i>homies and palones</i>, and the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now when these <i>fakements</i> were done, the <i>princesses</i> <i>trolled</i> to me, <i>cackling</i>, The <i>homies and palones</i> of Israel, and the <i>godly homies</i>, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the <i>homies and palones</i> of the lands, doing according to their <i>dowry cods</i>, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.
    </li>
    <li>For they have <i>lelled</i> of their <i>palone chavvies</i> for themselves, and for their <i>homie chavvies</i>: so that the <i>fabulosa</i> <i>maria</i> have mingled themselves with the <i>homies and palones</i> of those lands: <i>any road up</i>, the <i>famble</i> of the <i>princesses</i> and rulers hath been <i>dowriest</i> in this <i>caterver</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when I <i>aunt nelled</i> this <i>fakement</i>, I rent my <i>frock</i> and my mantle, and plucked off the <i>riah</i> of my <i>eke</i> and of my beard, and sat down astonied.
    </li>
    <li>Then were assembled unto me every <i>una</i> that trembled at the <i>lavs</i> of the <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been <i>lelled</i> away; and I sat astonied until the <i>bijou nochy</i> <i>parker</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And at the <i>bijou nochy</i> <i>parker</i> I arose up from my heaviness; and having rent my <i>frock</i> and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my <i>fambles</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i> my <i>Gloria</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackled</i>, O my <i>Gloria</i>, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my <i>eke</i> to thee, my <i>Gloria</i>: for our <i>cods</i> are increased over our <i>eke</i>, and our <i>caterver</i> is grown up unto the heavens.
    </li>
    <li>Since the days of our <i>aunties</i> have we been in a <i>dowry</i> <i>caterver</i> unto this <i>journo</i>; and for our <i>cods</i> have we, our <i>dowriest homies</i>, and our <i>godly homies</i>, been <i>laued</i> into the <i>famble</i> of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of the lands, to the <i>dowry efink</i>, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of <i>eke</i>, as it is this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And now for a <i>bijou</i> space <i>gracie</i> hath been shewed from the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i>, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to <i>parker</i> us a nail in <i>her</i> <i>fabulosa</i> place, that our <i>Gloria</i> may lighten our <i>ogles</i>, and <i>parker</i> us a <i>bijou</i> reviving in our bondage.
    </li>
    <li>For we were bondmen; yet our <i>Gloria</i> hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Persia, to <i>parker</i> us a reviving, to set up the <i>lattie</i> of our <i>Gloria</i>, and to repair the desolations thereof, and to <i>parker</i> us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And now, O our <i>Gloria</i>, what shall we <i>cackle</i> after this? for we have forsaken thy <i>butch lavs</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Which thou hast commanded by thy <i>serving homies</i> the prophets, <i>cackling</i>, The land, unto which ye <i>troll</i> to possess it, is an <i>nanti sparkle</i> land with the filthiness of the <i>homies and palones</i> of the lands, with their <i>dowry cods</i>, which have filled it from <i>una</i> end to another with their <i>nishta sparkle</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now therefore <i>parker</i> not your <i>palone chavvies</i> unto their <i>homie chavvies</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>lell</i> their <i>palone chavvies</i> unto your <i>homie chavvies</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>charper</i> their peace or their <i>metties</i> for ever: that ye may be <i>butch</i>, and <i>jarry</i> the <i>bona</i> of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your <i>chavvies</i> for ever.
    </li>
    <li>And after all that is <i>troll</i> upon us for our <i>nana</i> deeds, and for our <i>dowry</i> <i>caterver</i>, <i>vardaing</i> that thou our <i>Gloria</i> hast <i>zsa zsa-ed</i> us <i>nanti dowry</i> than our <i>cods</i> deserve, and hast <i>parkered</i> us such deliverance as this;
    </li>
    <li>Should we again break thy <i>butch lavs</i>, and join in affinity with the <i>homies and palones</i> of these <i>dowry cods</i>? wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant <i>nishta</i> escaping?
    </li>
    <li>O <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, thou art <i>bona</i>: for we remain yet <i>scarpered</i>, as it is this <i>journo</i>: <i>varda</i>, we are before thee in our <i>catervers</i>: for we cannot stand before thee because of this.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now when Ezra had prayed, and when <i>she</i> had confessed, weeping and <i>chucking</i> himself down before the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, there assembled unto <i>her</i> out of Israel a <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry</i> <i>punters</i> of <i>homies</i> and <i>palones</i> and <i>chavvies</i>: for the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>parnied</i> <i>dowry</i> sore.
    </li>
    <li>And Shechaniah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jehiel, <i>una</i> of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Elam, answered and <i>cackled</i> unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our <i>Gloria</i>, and have <i>lelled</i> strange <i>palone affairs</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i> of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this <i>fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now therefore let us make a covenant with our <i>Gloria</i> to put away all the <i>palone affairs</i>, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my <i>Duchess</i>, and of those that tremble at the <i>butch lav</i> of our <i>Gloria</i>; and let it be done according to the law.
    </li>
    <li>Arise; for this matter belongeth unto thee: we also will be with thee: be of <i>bona</i> courage, and do it.
    </li>
    <li>Then arose Ezra, and made the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homies</i>, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they should do according to this <i>lav</i>. And they sware.
    </li>
    <li>Then Ezra rose up from before the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and <i>trolled</i> into the <i>booth</i> of Johanan the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Eliashib: and when <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> thither, <i>she</i> did <i>jarry</i> no <i>pannan</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>buvare</i> <i>aqua</i>: for <i>she</i> mourned because of the transgression of them that had been <i>lelled</i> away.
    </li>
    <li>And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the <i>chavvies</i> of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;
    </li>
    <li>And that whosoever would not <i>troll</i> within <i>trey</i> days, according to the counsel of the <i>princesses</i> and the <i>fungi</i>, all <i>her</i> substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the <i>punters</i> of those that had been <i>lelled</i> away.
    </li>
    <li>Then all the <i>homies</i> of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within <i>trey</i> days. It was the ninth month, on the <i>dewey dachath</i> <i>journo</i> of the month; and all the <i>homies and palones</i> sat in the street of the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, trembling because of this matter, and for the <i>dowry</i> rain.
    </li>
    <li>And Ezra the <i>godly homie</i> stood up, and <i>cackled</i> unto them, Ye have transgressed, and have <i>lelled</i> strange <i>palone affairs</i>, to increase the <i>caterver</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>Now therefore make confession unto the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of your <i>aunties</i>, and do <i>her</i> pleasure: and separate yourselves from the <i>homies and palones</i> of the land, and from the strange <i>palone affairs</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then all the <i>punters</i> answered and <i>cackled</i> with a loud <i>cackling fakement</i>, As thou hast <i>cackled</i>, so must we do.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>homies and palones</i> are many, and it is a time of <i>dowry</i> rain, and we are not able to stand <i>nanti</i>, <i>nishta</i> is this a <i>acting dickey</i> of <i>una</i> <i>journo</i> or <i>dewey</i>: for we are many that have transgressed in this <i>fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Let now our rulers of all the <i>punters</i> stand, and let all them which have <i>lelled</i> strange <i>palone affairs</i> in our <i>smokes</i> <i>troll</i> at appointed times, and with them the <i>fungi</i> of every <i>smoke</i>, and the <i>beaks</i> thereof, until the fierce wrath of our <i>Gloria</i> for this matter be turned from us.
    </li>
    <li>Only Jonathan the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Asahel and Jahaziah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Tikvah were employed about this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of the captivity did so. And Ezra the <i>godly homie</i>, with certain <i>dowriest</i> of the <i>aunties</i>, after the <i>lattie</i> of their <i>aunties</i>, and all of them by their names, were separated, and sat down in the first <i>journo</i> of the <i>dachath</i> month to examine the matter.
    </li>
    <li>And they made an end with all the <i>homies</i> that had <i>lelled</i> strange <i>palone affairs</i> by the first <i>journo</i> of the first month.
    </li>
    <li>And among the <i>homie chavvies</i> of the <i>godly homies</i> there were found that had <i>lelled</i> strange <i>palone affairs</i>: namely, of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Jeshua the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jozadak, and <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>parkered</i> their <i>fambles</i> that they would put away their <i>palone affairs</i>; and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their <i>caterver</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Immer; Hanani, and Zebadiah.
    </li>
    <li>And of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Harim; Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah, and Jehiel, and Uzziah.
