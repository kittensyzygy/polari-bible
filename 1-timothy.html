    <h1>1 Timothy</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Pauline</i>, an apostle of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> by the <i>butch lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i> our Saviour, and <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, which is our hope;
    </li>
    <li>Unto Timothy, my own <i>homie chavvie</i> in the faith: <i>gracie</i>, mercy, and peace, from <i>Gloria</i> our <i>Auntie</i> and <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> our <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>As I besought thee to <i>lett</i> still at Ephesus, when I <i>trolled</i> into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,
    </li>
    <li><i>Nishta</i> <i>parker</i> heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than <i>fabe</i> edifying which is in faith: so do.
    </li>
    <li>Now the end of the <i>butch lav</i> is charity out of a pure <i>thumping cheat</i>, and of a <i>bona</i> conscience, and of faith unfeigned:
    </li>
    <li>From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;
    </li>
    <li>Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding <i>nishta</i> what they <i>cackle</i>, <i>nishta</i> whereof they affirm.
    </li>
    <li>But we know that the law is <i>bona</i>, if a <i>homie</i> use it lawfully;
    </li>
    <li>Knowing this, that the law is not made for a <i>bona</i> <i>homie</i>, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for <i>kerterverers</i>, for <i>nanna</i> and <i>billingsgate</i>, for murderers of <i>aunties</i> and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,
    </li>
    <li>For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with <i>homiekind</i>, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other <i>fakement</i> that is contrary to sound doctrine;
    </li>
    <li>According to the <i>fabe</i> <i>gossip</i> of the <i>fabed</i> <i>Gloria</i>, which was committed to my trust.
    </li>
    <li>And I thank <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i> our <i>Duchess</i>, who hath enabled me, for that <i>she</i> counted me <i>fabulous</i>, putting me into the ministry;
    </li>
    <li>Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>gracie</i> of our <i>Duchess</i> was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>This is a <i>fabulous</i> <i>cackling</i>, and <i>bona</i> of all acceptation, that <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>trolled</i> into the world to save <i>kerterverers</i>; of whom I am <i>dowriest</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on <i>her</i> to life everlasting.
    </li>
    <li>Now unto the <i>dowriest homie</i> eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise <i>Gloria</i>, be honour and <i>fabeness</i> for ever and ever. <i>Larlou</i>.
    </li>
    <li>This charge I commit unto thee, <i>homie chavvie</i> Timothy, according to the prophecies which <i>trolled</i> before on thee, that thou by them mightest <i>barney</i> a <i>bona</i> warfare;
    </li>
    <li>Holding faith, and a <i>bona</i> conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:
    </li>
    <li>Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have <i>laued</i> unto <i>Sadie</i>, that they may learn not to blaspheme.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, <i>meshigener mutterings</i>, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all <i>homies</i>;
    </li>
    <li>For <i>dowriest homies</i>, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all <i>fabeness</i> and honesty.
    </li>
    <li>For this is <i>bona</i> and acceptable in the <i>vardaing</i> of <i>Gloria</i> our Saviour;
    </li>
    <li>Who will have all <i>homies</i> to be saved, and to <i>troll</i> unto the knowledge of the truth.
    </li>
    <li>For there is <i>una</i> <i>Gloria</i>, and <i>una</i> mediator between <i>Gloria</i> and <i>homies</i>, the <i>homie</i> <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Who <i>parkered</i> himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.
    </li>
    <li>Whereunto I am ordained a <i>cackling homie</i>, and an apostle, (I <i>cackle</i> the truth in <i>Crystal</i>, and lie not;) a teacher of the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> in faith and verity.
    </li>
    <li>I will therefore that <i>homies</i> pray every where, lifting up <i>fabulosa</i> <i>fambles</i>, <i>nanti</i> wrath and doubting.
    </li>
    <li>In like manner also, that <i>palones</i> adorn themselves in modest <i>schmutter</i>, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided <i>riah</i>, or <i>gelt</i>, or <i>zhoosh</i>, or costly array;
    </li>
    <li>But (which becometh <i>palones</i> professing <i>fabeness</i>) with <i>bona</i> works.
    </li>
    <li>Let the <i>palone</i> learn in <i>nishta cackle</i> with all subjection.
    </li>
    <li>But I suffer not a <i>palone</i> to teach, <i>nishta</i> to usurp authority over the <i>homie</i>, but to be in <i>nishta cackle</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For Adam was first formed, then <i>Steve</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Adam was not <i>mogued</i>, but the <i>palone</i> being <i>mogued</i> was in the transgression.
    </li>
    <li>Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>This is a true <i>cackling</i>, If a <i>homie</i> <i>fancy</i> the office of a bishop, <i>she</i> desireth a <i>bona</i> <i>acting dickey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>A bishop then must be blameless, the <i>homie affair</i> of <i>una</i> <i>palone affair</i>, vigilant, sober, of <i>bona</i> behaviour, <i>parkered</i> to hospitality, apt to teach;
    </li>
    <li>Not <i>parkered</i> to <i>sherry</i>, no striker, not greedy of <i>manky</i> lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;
    </li>
    <li><i>Una</i> that ruleth well <i>her</i> own <i>lattie</i>, having <i>her</i> <i>chavvies</i> in subjection with all gravity;
    </li>
    <li>(For if a <i>homie</i> know not how to rule <i>her</i> own <i>lattie</i>, how shall <i>she</i> <i>lell</i> care of the <i>meshigener carsey</i> of <i>Gloria</i>?)
    </li>
    <li>Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride <i>she</i> fall into the condemnation of the devil.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover <i>she</i> must have a <i>bona</i> report of them which are <i>nanti</i>; lest <i>she</i> fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
    </li>
    <li>Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not <i>parkered</i> to <i>dowry</i> <i>sherry</i>, not greedy of <i>manky</i> lucre;
    </li>
    <li>Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
    </li>
    <li>And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless.
    </li>
    <li>Even so must their <i>palone affairs</i> be grave, not slanderers, sober, <i>fabulous</i> in all <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Let the deacons be the <i>homie affairs</i> of <i>una</i> <i>palone affair</i>, ruling their <i>chavvies</i> and their own <i>latties</i> well.
    </li>
    <li>For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a <i>bona</i> degree, and <i>dowry</i> boldness in the faith which is in <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>These <i>fakements</i> <i>screeve</i> I unto thee, hoping to <i>troll</i> unto thee shortly:
    </li>
    <li>But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, which is the <i>meshigener carsey</i> of the living <i>Gloria</i>, the pillar and ground of the truth.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>nanti</i> controversy <i>dowry</i> is the mystery of <i>fabeness</i>: <i>Gloria</i> was manifest in the flesh, justified in the <i>Fairy</i>, <i>vardad</i> of <i>fairies</i>, <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>, believed on in the world, <i>lalled</i> up into <i>fabeness</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now the <i>Fairy</i> <i>cackleth</i> expressly, that in the latter times some shall <i>troll off</i> from the faith, giving heed to seducing <i>fairies</i>, and doctrines of devils;
    </li>
    <li>Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;
    </li>
    <li>Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which <i>Gloria</i> hath created to be <i>lalled</i> with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.
    </li>
    <li>For every creature of <i>Gloria</i> is <i>bona</i>, and <i>nishter</i> to be refused, if it be <i>lalled</i> with thanksgiving:
    </li>
    <li>For it is sanctified by the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i> and <i>meshigener muttering</i>.
    </li>
    <li>If thou put the <i>sisters</i> in remembrance of these <i>fakements</i>, thou shalt be a <i>bona</i> minister of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, nourished up in the <i>lavs</i> of faith and of <i>bona</i> doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.
    </li>
    <li>But refuse <i>billingsgate</i> and <i>badge</i> <i>palone affairs</i>&#8216; fables, and exercise thyself rather unto <i>fabeness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For bodily exercise profiteth <i>bijou</i>: but <i>fabeness</i> is profitable unto all <i>fakements</i>, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to <i>troll</i>.
    </li>
    <li>This is a <i>fabulous</i> <i>cackling</i> and <i>bona</i> of all acceptation.
    </li>
    <li>For therefore we both <i>acting dickey</i> and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living <i>Gloria</i>, who is the Saviour of all <i>homies</i>, specially of those that believe.
    </li>
    <li>These <i>fakements</i> command and teach.
    </li>
    <li>Let no <i>homie</i> despise thy <i>beandom</i>; but be thou an example of the believers, in <i>lav</i>, in conversation, in charity, in <i>Fairy</i>, in faith, in purity.
    </li>
    <li>Till I <i>troll</i>, <i>parker</i> attendance to <i>vardaing the lavs</i>, to exhortation, to doctrine.
    </li>
    <li>Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was <i>parkered</i> thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the <i>fambles</i> of the presbytery.
    </li>
    <li>Meditate upon these <i>fakements</i>; <i>parker</i> thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.
    </li>
    <li><i>Lell</i> heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that <i>aunt nell</i> thee.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Rebuke not an elder, but intreat <i>her</i> as a <i>Auntie</i>; and the younger <i>homies</i> as <i>sisters</i>;
    </li>
    <li>The elder <i>palones</i> as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.
    </li>
    <li>Honour widows that are widows indeed.
    </li>
    <li>But if any widow have <i>chavvies</i> or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is <i>bona</i> and acceptable before <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in <i>Gloria</i>, and continueth in supplications and <i>meshigener mutterings</i> <i>nochy</i> and <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But she that <i>letteth</i> in pleasure is <i>stiff</i> while she <i>letteth</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And these <i>fakements</i> <i>parker</i> in charge, that they may be blameless.
    </li>
    <li>But if any provide not for <i>her</i> own, and specially for those of <i>her</i> own <i>lattie</i>, <i>she</i> hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.
    </li>
    <li>Let not a widow be <i>lelled</i> into the number under <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> years <i>badge</i>, having been the <i>palone affair</i> of <i>una</i> <i>homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Well reported of for <i>bona</i> works; if she have brought up <i>chavvies</i>, if she have lodged strangers, if she have <i>dhobied</i> the saints&#8217; <i>plates</i>, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently <i>trolled after</i> every <i>bona</i> <i>acting dickey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against <i>Crystal</i>, they will marry;
    </li>
    <li>Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith.
    </li>
    <li>And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from <i>lattie</i> to <i>lattie</i>; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking <i>fakements</i> which they ought not.
    </li>
    <li>I will therefore that the younger <i>palones</i> marry, bear <i>chavvies</i>, guide the <i>lattie</i>, <i>parker</i> none occasion to the adversary to <i>cackle</i> reproachfully.
    </li>
    <li>For some are already turned aside after <i>Sadie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>If any <i>homie</i> or <i>palone</i> that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the <i>meshigener carsey</i> be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.
    </li>
    <li>Let the <i>fungi</i> that rule well be counted <i>bona</i> of double honour, especially they who <i>acting dickey</i> in the <i>lav</i> and doctrine.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>glossy</i> <i>cackleth</i>, <i>nishta</i> muzzle the ox that <i>minceth</i> out the corn. And, The labourer is <i>bona</i> of <i>her</i> <i>parkering</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Against an elder <i>lall</i> not an accusation, but before <i>dewey</i> or <i>trey</i> witnesses.
    </li>
    <li>Them that <i>kertever</i> rebuke before all, that others also may fear.
    </li>
    <li>I charge thee before <i>Gloria</i>, and the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, and the elect <i>fairies</i>, that thou observe these <i>fakements</i> <i>nanti</i> preferring <i>una</i> before another, doing <i>nishter</i> by partiality.
    </li>
    <li><i>Lett</i> <i>fambles</i> suddenly on no <i>homie</i>, <i>nishta</i> be partaker of other <i>homies</i>&#8216;s <i>kertervers</i>: keep thyself pure.
    </li>
    <li><i>Buvare</i> no longer <i>aqua</i>, but use a <i>bijou</i> <i>sherry</i> for thy stomach&#8217;s sake and thine often infirmities.
    </li>
    <li>Some <i>homies</i>&#8216;s <i>kertervers</i> are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some <i>homies</i> they <i>troll after</i> after.
    </li>
    <li>Likewise also the <i>bona</i> works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Let as many <i>serving homies</i> as are under the yoke count their own masters <i>bona</i> of all honour, that the name of <i>Gloria</i> and <i>her</i> doctrine be not blasphemed.
    </li>
    <li>And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are <i>sisters</i>; but rather do them service, because they are <i>fabulous</i> and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These <i>fakements</i> teach and exhort.
    </li>
    <li>If any <i>homie</i> teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome <i>lavs</i>, even the <i>lavs</i> of our <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, and to the doctrine which is according to <i>fabeness</i>;
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> is proud, knowing <i>nishter</i>, but doting about questions and strifes of <i>lavs</i>, whereof <i>trolleth</i> envy, strife, railings, <i>nana</i> surmisings,
    </li>
    <li>Perverse disputings of <i>homies</i> of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is <i>fabeness</i>: from such withdraw thyself.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>fabeness</i> with contentment is <i>dowry</i> gain.
    </li>
    <li>For we brought <i>nishter</i> into this world, and it is certain we can carry <i>nishter</i> out.
    </li>
    <li>And having <i>manjarry</i> and <i>clobber</i> let us be therewith content.
    </li>
    <li>But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many <i>dizzy</i> and hurtful lusts, which drown <i>homies</i> in destruction and perdition.
    </li>
    <li>For the love of <i>dinarly</i> is the root of all <i>nana</i>: which while some <i>ogled</i> after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many <i>shardas</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But thou, O <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, <i>scarper</i> these <i>fakements</i>; and <i>troll after</i> after <i>bonaness</i>, <i>fabeness</i>, faith, love, patience, <i>campness</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Palaver</i> the <i>bona</i> <i>palaver</i> of faith, <i>lett</i> hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also <i>screeched</i>, and hast professed a <i>bona</i> profession before many witnesses.
    </li>
    <li>I <i>parker</i> thee charge in the <i>vardaing</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, who quickeneth all <i>fakements</i>, and before <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i>, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a <i>bona</i> confession;
    </li>
    <li>That thou keep this <i>butch lav</i> <i>nanti</i> spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of our <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Which in <i>her</i> times <i>she</i> shall shew, who is the <i>fabed</i> and only Potentate, the <i>dowriest homie</i> of <i>dowriest homies</i>, and <i>Duchess</i> of <i>ladies</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the <i>sparkle</i> which no <i>homie</i> can approach unto; whom no <i>homie</i> hath <i>vardad</i>, <i>nishta</i> can <i>varda</i>: to whom be honour and power everlasting. <i>Larlou</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, <i>nishta</i> trust in uncertain riches, but in the living <i>Gloria</i>, who giveth us richly all <i>fakements</i> to enjoy;
    </li>
    <li>That they do <i>bona</i>, that they be rich in <i>bona</i> works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;
    </li>
    <li>Laying up in store for themselves a <i>bona</i> foundation against the time to <i>troll</i>, that they may <i>lett</i> hold on eternal life.
    </li>
    <li>O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding <i>billingsgate</i> and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so <i>screeched</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. <i>Gracie</i> be with thee. <i>Larlou</i>.
