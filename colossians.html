    <h1>Colossians</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Pauline</i>, an apostle of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> by the will of <i>Gloria</i>, and Timotheus our <i>sister</i>,
    </li>
    <li>To the saints and <i>fabulous</i> <i>sisters</i> in <i>Crystal</i> which are at Colosse: <i>gracie</i> be unto you, and peace, from <i>Gloria</i> our <i>Auntie</i> and the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>We <i>parker</i> thanks to <i>Gloria</i> and the <i>Auntie</i> of our <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, praying always for you,
    </li>
    <li>Since we <i>aunt nelled</i> of your faith in <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i>, and of the love which ye have to all the saints,
    </li>
    <li>For the hope which is <i>laued</i> up for you in heaven, whereof ye <i>aunt nelled</i> before in the <i>lav</i> of the truth of the <i>gossip</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Which is <i>troll</i> unto you, as it is in all the world; and <i>parkereth</i> forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the <i>journo</i> ye <i>aunt nelled</i> of it, and knew the <i>gracie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>no flies</i>:
    </li>
    <li>As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a <i>fabulous</i> minister of <i>Crystal</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Who also <i>screeched</i> unto us your love in the <i>Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For this cause we also, since the <i>journo</i> we <i>aunt nelled</i> it, <i>nix</i> cease to pray for you, and to <i>fancy</i> that ye might be filled with the knowledge of <i>her</i> will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;
    </li>
    <li>That ye might <i>mince</i> <i>bona</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every <i>bona</i> <i>acting dickey</i>, and increasing in the knowledge of <i>Gloria</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Strengthened with all might, according to <i>her</i> <i>fabe</i> power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;
    </li>
    <li>Giving thanks unto the <i>Auntie</i>, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in <i>sparkle</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Who hath <i>laued</i> us from the power of <i>munge</i>, and hath translated us into the kingdom of <i>her</i> dear <i>homie chavvie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>In whom we have redemption through <i>her</i> blood, even the forgiveness of <i>kertervers</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Who is the image of the invisible <i>Gloria</i>, the firstborn of every creature:
    </li>
    <li>For by <i>her</i> were all <i>fakements</i> created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all <i>fakements</i> were created by <i>her</i>, and for <i>her</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> is before all <i>fakements</i>, and by <i>her</i> all <i>fakements</i> consist.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> is the <i>eke</i> of the <i>lucoddy</i>, the <i>meshigener carsey</i>: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the <i>stiff</i>; that in all <i>fakements</i> <i>she</i> might have the preeminence.
    </li>
    <li>For it pleased the <i>Auntie</i> that in <i>her</i> should all fulness <i>lett</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And, having made peace through the blood of <i>her</i> cross, by <i>her</i> to reconcile all <i>fakements</i> unto himself; by <i>her</i>, I <i>cackle</i>, whether they be <i>fakements</i> in earth, or <i>fakements</i> in heaven.
    </li>
    <li>And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by <i>naff</i> works, yet now hath <i>she</i> reconciled
    </li>
    <li>In the <i>lucoddy</i> of <i>her</i> flesh through <i>carking it</i>, to present you <i>fabulosa</i> and unblameable and unreproveable in <i>her</i> <i>vardaing</i>:
    </li>
    <li>If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not <i>trolled</i> away from the hope of the <i>gossip</i>, which ye have <i>aunt nelled</i>, and which was <i>cackled</i> to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I <i>Pauline</i> am made a minister;
    </li>
    <li>Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of <i>Crystal</i> in my flesh for <i>her</i> <i>lucoddy</i>&#8216;s sake, which is the <i>meshigener carsey</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of <i>Gloria</i> which is <i>parkered</i> to me for you, to fulfil the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from <i>chavvies</i>, but now is made manifest to <i>her</i> saints:
    </li>
    <li>To whom <i>Gloria</i> would make known what is the riches of the <i>fabeness</i> of this mystery among the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>; which is <i>Crystal</i> in you, the hope of <i>fabeness</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Whom we <i>cackle</i>, warning every <i>homie</i>, and teaching every <i>homie</i> in all wisdom; that we may present every <i>homie</i> <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i> in <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Whereunto I also <i>acting dickey</i>, striving according to <i>her</i> working, which worketh in me mightily.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>For I would that ye knew what <i>dowry</i> conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not <i>vardad</i> my <i>eke</i> in the flesh;
    </li>
    <li>That their <i>thumping cheats</i> might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of <i>Gloria</i>, and of the <i>Auntie</i>, and of <i>Crystal</i>;
    </li>
    <li>In whom are hid all the <i>gelt</i> of wisdom and knowledge.
    </li>
    <li>And this I <i>cackle</i>, lest any <i>homie</i> should beguile you with enticing <i>lavs</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the <i>Fairy</i>, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>As ye have therefore <i>lalled</i> <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, so <i>mince</i> ye in <i>her</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Rooted and built up in <i>her</i>, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.
    </li>
    <li><i>Gardy loo</i> lest any <i>homie</i> spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of <i>homies</i>, after the rudiments of the world, and not after <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For in <i>her</i> <i>letteth</i> all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.
    </li>
    <li>And ye are complete in <i>her</i>, which is the <i>eke</i> of all principality and power:
    </li>
    <li>In whom also ye are <i>roundhead</i> with the circumcision made <i>nanti</i> <i>fambles</i>, in putting off the <i>lucoddy</i> of the <i>kertervers</i> of the flesh by the circumcision of <i>Crystal</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Buried with <i>her</i> in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with <i>her</i> through the faith of the operation of <i>Gloria</i>, who hath raised <i>her</i> from the <i>stiff</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And you, being <i>stiff</i> in your <i>kertervers</i> and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath <i>she</i> quickened together with <i>her</i>, having forgiven you all <i>catervers</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and <i>lelled</i> it out of the way, nailing it to <i>her</i> cross;
    </li>
    <li>And having spoiled principalities and powers, <i>she</i> made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.
    </li>
    <li>Let no <i>homie</i> therefore <i>beak</i> you in <i>carnish</i>, or in <i>buvare</i>, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:
    </li>
    <li>Which are a shadow of <i>fakements</i> to <i>troll</i>; but the <i>lucoddy</i> is of <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Let no <i>homie</i> beguile you of your <i>parkering</i> in a voluntary humility and worshipping of <i>fairies</i>, intruding into those <i>fakements</i> which <i>she</i> hath not <i>vardad</i>, vainly puffed up by <i>her</i> fleshly mind,
    </li>
    <li>And not holding the <i>eke</i>, from which all the <i>lucoddy</i> by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore if ye be <i>stiff</i> with <i>Crystal</i> from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,
    </li>
    <li>(<i>reef</i> not; taste not; handle not;
    </li>
    <li>Which all are to perish with the using;) after the <i>butch lavs</i> and doctrines of <i>homies</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Which <i>fakements</i> have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the <i>lucoddy</i>: not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>If ye then be risen with <i>Crystal</i>, <i>charper</i> those <i>fakements</i> which are above, where <i>Crystal</i> sitteth on the <i>sweet martini</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Set your affection on <i>fakements</i> above, not on <i>fakements</i> on the earth.
    </li>
    <li>For ye are <i>stiff</i>, and your life is hid with <i>Crystal</i> in <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>When <i>Crystal</i>, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with <i>her</i> in <i>fabeness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; <i>charvering</i>, <i>nishta sparkle</i>, inordinate affection, <i>nana</i> concupiscence, and <i>ogling</i>, which is idolatry:
    </li>
    <li>For which <i>fakements</i>&#8216; sake the wrath of <i>Gloria</i> <i>trolleth</i> on the <i>chavvies</i> of disobedience:
    </li>
    <li>In the which ye also <i>minced</i> some time, when ye lived in them.
    </li>
    <li>But now ye also put off all these; <i>wild</i>, wrath, malice, <i>billingsgate</i>, <i>manky</i> communication out of your <i>screech</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Lie not <i>una</i> to another, <i>vardaing</i> that ye have put off the <i>badge cove</i> with <i>her</i> deeds;
    </li>
    <li>And have put on the new <i>homie</i>, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of <i>her</i> that created <i>her</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Where there is <i>nishta</i> Greek <i>nishta</i> <i>kosher homie</i>, circumcision <i>nishta</i> uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond <i>nishta</i> free: but <i>Crystal</i> is all, and in all.
    </li>
    <li>Put on therefore, as the elect of <i>Gloria</i>, <i>fabulosa</i> and beloved, <i>chutney locker</i> of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, <i>campness</i>, longsuffering;
    </li>
    <li>Forbearing <i>una</i> another, and forgiving <i>una</i> another, if any <i>homie</i> have a quarrel against any: even as <i>Crystal</i> forgave you, so also do ye.
    </li>
    <li>And above all these <i>fakements</i> put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.
    </li>
    <li>And let the peace of <i>Gloria</i> rule in your <i>thumping cheats</i>, to the which also ye are <i>screeched</i> in <i>una</i> <i>lucoddy</i>; and be ye thankful.
    </li>
    <li>Let the <i>lav</i> of <i>Crystal</i> <i>lett</i> in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing <i>una</i> another in psalms and hymns and spiritual <i>chants</i>, singing with <i>gracie</i> in your <i>thumping cheats</i> to the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And whatsoever ye do in <i>lav</i> or deed, do all in the name of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i>, giving thanks to <i>Gloria</i> and the <i>Auntie</i> by <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Palone affairs</i>, submit yourselves unto your own <i>homie affairs</i>, as it is fit in the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Homie affairs</i>, love your <i>palone affairs</i>, and be not bitter against them.
    </li>
    <li><i>Chavvies</i>, obey your parents in all <i>fakements</i>: for this is well pleasing unto the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Aunties</i>, provoke not your <i>chavvies</i> to <i>wild</i>, lest they be discouraged.
    </li>
    <li><i>Serving homies</i>, obey in all <i>fakements</i> your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of <i>thumping cheat</i>, fearing <i>Gloria</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the <i>Duchess</i>, and not unto <i>homies</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Knowing that of the <i>Duchess</i> ye shall <i>lall</i> the <i>parkering</i> of the inheritance: for ye serve the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> that doeth wrong shall <i>lall</i> for the wrong which <i>she</i> hath done: and there is no respect of persons.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Masters, <i>parker</i> unto your <i>serving homies</i> that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.
    </li>
    <li>Continue in <i>meshigener muttering</i>, and <i>varda</i> in the same with thanksgiving;
    </li>
    <li>Withal praying also for us, that <i>Gloria</i> would open unto us a door of utterance, to <i>cackle</i> the mystery of <i>Crystal</i>, for which I am also in bonds:
    </li>
    <li>That I may make it manifest, as I ought to <i>cackle</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Mince</i> in wisdom toward them that are <i>nanti</i>, redeeming the time.
    </li>
    <li>Let your <i>cackle</i> be alway with <i>gracie</i>, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every <i>homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>All my state shall Tychicus <i>screech</i> unto you, who is a beloved <i>sister</i>, and a <i>fabulous</i> minister and fellowservant in the <i>Duchess</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Whom I have <i>laued</i> unto you for the same purpose, that <i>she</i> might know your estate, and comfort your <i>thumping cheats</i>;
    </li>
    <li>With Onesimus, a <i>fabulous</i> and beloved <i>sister</i>, who is <i>una</i> of you. They shall make known unto you all <i>fakements</i> which are done here.
    </li>
    <li>Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister&#8217;s <i>homie chavvie</i> to Barnabas, (<i>reefing</i> whom ye <i>lalled</i> <i>butch lavs</i>: if <i>she</i> <i>troll</i> unto you, <i>lall</i> <i>her</i>😉
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i>, which is <i>screeched</i> Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>, which have been a comfort unto me.
    </li>
    <li>Epaphras, who is <i>una</i> of you, a <i>serving homie</i> of <i>Crystal</i>, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in <i>meshigener mutterings</i>, that ye may stand <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i> and complete in all the will of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For I bear <i>her</i> record, that <i>she</i> hath a <i>dowry</i> zeal for you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.
    </li>
    <li><i>Lucille</i>, the beloved <i>crocus</i>, and Demas, greet you.
    </li>
    <li>Salute the <i>sisters</i> which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the <i>meshigener carsey</i> which is in <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when this epistle is <i>varda the lavs</i> among you, cause that it be <i>varda the lavs</i> also in the <i>meshigener carsey</i> of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise <i>varda the lavs</i> the epistle from Laodicea.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackle</i> to Archippus, <i>lell</i> heed to the ministry which thou hast <i>lalled</i> in the <i>Duchess</i>, that thou fulfil it.
    </li>
    <li>The salutation by the <i>famble</i> of me <i>Pauline</i>. Remember my bonds. <i>Gracie</i> be with you. <i>Larlou</i>.
