    <h1>Acts</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that <i>Josie</i> began both to do and teach,
    </li>
    <li>Until the <i>journo</i> in which <i>she</i> was <i>lelled</i> up, after that <i>she</i> through the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i> had <i>parkered</i> <i>butch lavs</i> unto the apostles whom <i>she</i> had chosen:
    </li>
    <li>To whom also <i>she</i> shewed himself alive after <i>her</i> passion by many infallible proofs, being <i>vardad</i> of them <i>quarter dacha</i> days, and speaking of the <i>fakements</i> pertaining to the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not <i>troll off</i> from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the <i>Auntie</i>, which, <i>cackleth</i> <i>she</i>, ye have <i>aunt nelled</i> of me.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>Jane</i> truly baptized with <i>aqua</i>; but ye shall be baptized with the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i> not many days hence.
    </li>
    <li>When they therefore were <i>troll</i> together, they asked of <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the <i>Auntie</i> hath put in <i>her</i> own power.
    </li>
    <li>But ye shall <i>lall</i> power, after that the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i> is <i>troll</i> upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> had <i>cackled</i> these <i>fakements</i>, while they beheld, <i>she</i> was <i>lelled</i> up; and a cloud <i>lalled</i> <i>her</i> out of their <i>vardaing</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> up, <i>varda</i>, <i>dewey</i> <i>homies</i> stood by them in white <i>schmutter</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Which also <i>cackled</i>, Ye <i>homies</i> of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same <i>Josie</i>, which is <i>lelled</i> up from you into heaven, shall so <i>troll</i> in like manner as ye have <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i> <i>troll</i> into heaven.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>trolled back</i> they unto Jerusalem from the mount <i>screeched</i> Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath <i>journo</i>&#8216;s journey.
    </li>
    <li>And when they were <i>troll</i> in, they <i>trolled</i> up into an <i>dark room</i>, where <i>letted</i> both <i>Petra</i>, and James, and <i>Jane</i>, and <i>Andrea</i>, <i>Phyllis</i>, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and <i>Matilda</i>, James the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Alphaeus, and <i>Simone</i> Zelotes, and Judas the <i>sister</i> of James.
    </li>
    <li>These all continued with <i>una</i> accord in <i>meshigener muttering</i> and supplication, with the <i>palones</i>, and Mary the mother of <i>Josie</i>, and with <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And in those days <i>Petra</i> stood up in the midst of the disciples, and <i>cackled</i>, (the number of names together were about an <i>chenter</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i>,)
    </li>
    <li><i>Homies</i> and <i>sisters</i>, this <i>glossy</i> must needs have been fulfilled, which the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i> by the <i>screech</i> of <i>Davina</i> <i>cackled</i> before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that <i>lelled</i> <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.
    </li>
    <li>Now this <i>homie</i> purchased a field with the <i>parkering</i> of <i>codness</i>; and falling headlong, <i>she</i> burst asunder in the midst, and all <i>her</i> <i>chutney locker</i> gushed out.
    </li>
    <li>And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is <i>screeched</i> in their proper <i>polari</i>, Aceldama, that is to <i>cackle</i>, The field of blood.
    </li>
    <li>For it is <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of Psalms, Let <i>her</i> habitation be desolate, and let no <i>homie</i> <i>lett</i> therein: and <i>her</i> bishoprick let another <i>lell</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore of these <i>homies</i> which have companied with us all the time that the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>trolled</i> in and out among us,
    </li>
    <li>Beginning from the baptism of <i>Jane</i>, unto that same <i>journo</i> that <i>she</i> was <i>lelled</i> up from us, must <i>una</i> be ordained to be a <i>varda-ing fakement</i> with us of <i>her</i> resurrection.
    </li>
    <li>And they appointed <i>dewey</i>, <i>Josephine</i> <i>screeched</i> Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.
    </li>
    <li>And they prayed, and <i>cackled</i>, Thou, <i>Duchess</i>, which knowest the <i>thumping cheats</i> of all <i>homies</i>, shew whether of these <i>dewey</i> thou hast chosen,
    </li>
    <li>That <i>she</i> may <i>lell</i> part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that <i>she</i> might <i>troll</i> to <i>her</i> own place.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>parkered</i> forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and <i>she</i> was numbered with the <i>long dedger</i> apostles.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And when the <i>journo</i> of Pentecost was fully <i>troll</i>, they were all with <i>una</i> accord in <i>una</i> place.
    </li>
    <li>And suddenly there <i>trolled</i> a sound from heaven as of a rushing <i>dowry butch</i> wind, and it filled all the <i>lattie</i> where they were sitting.
    </li>
    <li>And there appeared unto them cloven <i>polaris</i> like as of <i>binco fakement</i>, and it sat upon each of them.
    </li>
    <li>And they were all filled with the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>, and began to <i>cackle</i> with other <i>polaris</i>, as the <i>Fairy</i> <i>parkered</i> them utterance.
    </li>
    <li>And there were dwelling at Jerusalem <i>kosher homies</i>, devout <i>homies</i>, out of every nation under heaven.
    </li>
    <li>Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude <i>trolled</i> together, and were <i>bamboozled</i>, because that every <i>homie</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> them <i>cackle</i> in <i>her</i> own language.
    </li>
    <li>And they were all <i>gobsmacked</i> and marvelled, <i>cackling</i> <i>una</i> to another, <i>varda</i>, are not all these which <i>cackle</i> Galilaeans?
    </li>
    <li>And how <i>aunt nell</i> we every <i>homie</i> in our own <i>polari</i>, wherein we were born?
    </li>
    <li>Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,
    </li>
    <li>Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, <i>kosher homies</i> and proselytes,
    </li>
    <li>Cretes and Arabians, we do <i>aunt nell</i> them <i>cackle</i> in our <i>polaris</i> the <i>fortuni</i> works of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they were all <i>gobsmacked</i>, and were in doubt, <i>cackling</i> <i>una</i> to another, What meaneth this?
    </li>
    <li>Others mocking <i>cackled</i>, These <i>homies</i> are full of new <i>sherry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>Petra</i>, standing up with the <i>long dedger</i>, lifted up <i>her</i> <i>cackling fakement</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto them, Ye <i>homies</i> of Judaea, and all ye that <i>lett</i> at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and <i>aunt nell</i> to my <i>lavs</i>:
    </li>
    <li>For these are not <i>daffy</i>, as ye suppose, <i>vardaing</i> it is but the third hour of the <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But this is that which was <i>cackled</i> by the prophet Joel;
    </li>
    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass in the last days, <i>cackleth</i> <i>Gloria</i>, I will pour out of my <i>Fairy</i> upon all flesh: and your <i>homie chavvies</i> and your <i>palone chavvies</i> shall prophesy, and your <i>bean coves</i> shall <i>varda</i> visions, and your <i>badge coves</i> shall dream dreams:
    </li>
    <li>And on my <i>serving homies</i> and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my <i>Fairy</i>; and they shall prophesy:
    </li>
    <li>And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and <i>binco fakement</i>, and vapour of smoke:
    </li>
    <li>The sun shall be turned into <i>munge</i>, and the moon into blood, before the <i>dowry</i> and notable <i>journo</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>troll</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, that whosoever shall <i>screech</i> on the name of the <i>Duchess</i> shall be saved.
    </li>
    <li>Ye <i>homies</i> of Israel, <i>aunt nell</i> these <i>lavs</i>; <i>Josie</i> of Nazareth, a <i>homie</i> approved of <i>Gloria</i> among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which <i>Gloria</i> did by <i>her</i> in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:
    </li>
    <li><i>Her</i>, being <i>laued</i> by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of <i>Gloria</i>, ye have <i>lelled</i>, and by <i>naff</i> <i>fambles</i> have crucified and <i>ferricadoozed</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Whom <i>Gloria</i> hath raised up, having loosed the pains of <i>carking it</i>: because it was not possible that <i>she</i> should be holden of it.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>Davina</i> <i>cackleth</i> concerning <i>her</i>, I foresaw the <i>Duchess</i> always before my <i>eke</i>, for <i>she</i> is on my <i>sweet martini</i>, that I should not be <i>trolled</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Therefore did my <i>thumping cheat</i> rejoice, and my <i>polari</i> was glad; moreover also my flesh shall <i>lettie</i> in hope:
    </li>
    <li>Because thou wilt not leave my <i>nishta lucoddy</i> in hell, <i>nishta</i> wilt thou suffer thine <i>fabulosa</i> <i>una</i> to <i>varda</i> corruption.
    </li>
    <li>Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.
    </li>
    <li><i>Homies</i> and <i>sisters</i>, let me freely <i>cackle</i> unto you of the patriarch <i>Davina</i>, that <i>she</i> is both <i>stiff</i> and buried, and <i>her</i> sepulchre is with us unto this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that <i>Gloria</i> had sworn with an oath to <i>her</i>, that of the fruit of <i>her</i> loins, according to the flesh, <i>she</i> would raise up <i>Crystal</i> to <i>lett</i> on <i>her</i> throne;
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> <i>vardaing</i> this before <i>cackled</i> of the resurrection of <i>Crystal</i>, that <i>her</i> <i>nishta lucoddy</i> was not <i>dry</i> in hell, <i>nishta</i> <i>her</i> flesh did <i>varda</i> corruption.
    </li>
    <li>This <i>Josie</i> hath <i>Gloria</i> raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore being by the <i>sweet martini</i> of <i>Gloria</i> exalted, and having <i>lalled</i> of the <i>Auntie</i> the promise of the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>, <i>she</i> hath shed forth this, which ye now <i>varda</i> and <i>aunt nell</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>Davina</i> is not <i>trolled up</i> into the heavens: but <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i> himself, The <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto my <i>Duchess</i>, <i>lett</i> thou on my <i>sweet martini</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Until I make thy foes thy footstool.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore let all the <i>lattie</i> of Israel know assuredly, that <i>Gloria</i> hath made the same <i>Josie</i>, whom ye have crucified, both <i>Duchess</i> and <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now when they <i>aunt nelled</i> this, they were pricked in their <i>thumping cheat</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Petra</i> and to the <i>lettie</i> of the apostles, <i>homies</i> and <i>sisters</i>, what shall we do?
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>Petra</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Repent, and be baptized every <i>una</i> of you in the name of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> for the remission of <i>kertervers</i>, and ye shall <i>lall</i> the gift of the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For the promise is unto you, and to your <i>chavvies</i>, and to all that are <i>nishta ajax</i> off, even as many as the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i> shall <i>screech</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And with many other <i>lavs</i> did <i>she</i> testify and exhort, <i>cackling</i>, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.
    </li>
    <li>Then they that gladly <i>lalled</i> <i>her</i> <i>lav</i> were baptized: and the same <i>journo</i> there were added unto them about <i>trey</i> <i>mille</i> <i>nishta lucoddies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they continued stedfastly in the apostles&#8217; doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of <i>pannan</i>, and in <i>meshigener mutterings</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And fear <i>trolled</i> upon every <i>nishta lucoddy</i>: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.
    </li>
    <li>And all that believed were together, and had all <i>fakements</i> common;
    </li>
    <li>And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all <i>homies</i>, as every <i>homie</i> had need.
    </li>
    <li>And they, continuing daily with <i>una</i> accord in the <i>holy carsey</i>, and breaking <i>pannan</i> from <i>lattie</i> to <i>lattie</i>, did <i>jarry</i> their <i>carnish</i> with gladness and singleness of <i>thumping cheat</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Praising <i>Gloria</i>, and having favour with all the <i>homies and palones</i>. And the <i>Duchess</i> added to the <i>meshigener carsey</i> daily such as should be saved.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now <i>Petra</i> and <i>Jane</i> <i>trolled</i> up together into the <i>holy carsey</i> at the hour of <i>meshigener muttering</i>, being the ninth hour.
    </li>
    <li>And a certain <i>homie</i> <i>nanti wallop</i> from <i>her</i> mother&#8217;s womb was <i>lelled</i>, whom they <i>laued</i> daily at the gate of the <i>holy carsey</i> which is <i>screeched</i> Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the <i>holy carsey</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Who <i>vardaing</i> <i>Petra</i> and <i>Jane</i> about to <i>troll</i> into the <i>holy carsey</i> asked an alms.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Petra</i>, fastening <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i> upon <i>her</i> with <i>Jane</i>, <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i> on us.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> heed unto them, expecting to <i>lall</i> something of them.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>Petra</i> <i>cackled</i>, Silver and <i>gelt</i> have I none; but such as I have <i>parker</i> I thee: In the name of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> of Nazareth rise up and <i>mince</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> by the <i>sweet martini</i>, and lifted <i>her</i> up: and immediately <i>her</i> <i>plates</i> and ankle bones <i>lalled</i> <i>butchness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> leaping up stood, and <i>minced</i>, and entered with them into the <i>holy carsey</i>, <i>mincing</i>, and leaping, and praising <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And all the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i> <i>mincing</i> and praising <i>Gloria</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And they knew that it was <i>she</i> which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the <i>holy carsey</i>: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And as the <i>nanti wallop</i> <i>homie</i> which was healed held <i>Petra</i> and <i>Jane</i>, all the <i>homies and palones</i> ran together unto them in the porch that is <i>screeched</i> Solomon&#8217;s, greatly wondering.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>Petra</i> <i>vardad</i> it, <i>she</i> answered unto the <i>homies and palones</i>, Ye <i>homies</i> of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why <i>varda</i> ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this <i>homie</i> to <i>mince</i>?
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Gloria</i> of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the <i>Gloria</i> of our <i>aunties</i>, hath glorified <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> <i>Josie</i>; whom ye <i>laued</i> up, and denied <i>her</i> in the presence of Pilate, when <i>she</i> was determined to let <i>her</i> <i>troll</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But ye denied the <i>fabulosa</i> <i>una</i> and the Just, and <i>fancied</i> a murderer to be granted unto you;
    </li>
    <li>And <i>ferricadozad</i> the <i>princess</i> of life, whom <i>Gloria</i> hath raised from the <i>stiff</i>; whereof we are witnesses.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>her</i> name through faith in <i>her</i> name hath made this <i>homie</i> <i>butch</i>, whom ye <i>varda</i> and know: <i>any road up</i>, the faith which is by <i>her</i> hath <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> this <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i> soundness in the presence of you all.
    </li>
    <li>And now, <i>sisters</i>, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers.
    </li>
    <li>But those <i>fakements</i>, which <i>Gloria</i> before had shewed by the <i>screech</i> of all <i>her</i> prophets, that <i>Crystal</i> should suffer, <i>she</i> hath so fulfilled.
    </li>
    <li>Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your <i>kertervers</i> may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall <i>troll</i> from the presence of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> shall <i>lau</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, which before was <i>cackled</i> unto you:
    </li>
    <li>Whom the heaven must <i>lall</i> until the times of restitution of all <i>fakements</i>, which <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>cackled</i> by the <i>screech</i> of all <i>her</i> <i>fabulosa</i> prophets since the world began.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>Maureen</i> truly <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>aunties</i>, A prophet shall the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i> raise up unto you of your <i>sisters</i>, like unto me; <i>her</i> shall ye <i>aunt nell</i> in all <i>fakements</i> whatsoever <i>she</i> shall <i>cackle</i> unto you.
    </li>
    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, that every <i>nishta lucoddy</i>, which will not <i>aunt nell</i> that prophet, shall be <i>battyfanged</i> from among the <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that <i>troll after</i> after, as many as have <i>cackled</i>, have likewise foretold of these days.
    </li>
    <li>Ye are the <i>chavvies</i> of the prophets, and of the covenant which <i>Gloria</i> made with our <i>aunties</i>, <i>cackling</i> unto Abraham, And in thy <i>maria</i> shall all the kindreds of the earth be <i>fabed</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Unto you first <i>Gloria</i>, having raised up <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> <i>Josie</i>, <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> to bless you, in turning away every <i>una</i> of you from <i>her</i> <i>cods</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And as they <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>homies and palones</i>, the <i>godly homies</i>, and the captain of the <i>holy carsey</i>, and the Sadducees, <i>trolled</i> upon them,
    </li>
    <li>Being grieved that they taught the <i>homies and palones</i>, and <i>cackled</i> through <i>Josie</i> the resurrection from the <i>stiff</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>laued</i> <i>fambles</i> on them, and put them in hold unto the next <i>journo</i>: for it was now eventide.
    </li>
    <li>Howbeit many of them which <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>lav</i> believed; and the number of the <i>homies</i> was about <i>chinker</i> <i>mille</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> on the morrow, that their rulers, and <i>fungi</i>, and <i>betty bracelets</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And Annas the high <i>godly homie</i>, and Caiaphas, and <i>Jane</i>, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high <i>godly homie</i>, were gathered together at Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>Petra</i>, filled with the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>, <i>cackled</i> unto them, Ye rulers of the <i>homies and palones</i>, and <i>fungi</i> of Israel,
    </li>
    <li>If we this <i>journo</i> be examined of the <i>bona</i> deed done to the impotent <i>homie</i>, by what means <i>she</i> is made whole;
    </li>
    <li>Be it known unto you all, and to all the <i>homies and palones</i> of Israel, that by the name of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom <i>Gloria</i> raised from the <i>stiff</i>, even by <i>her</i> doth this <i>homie</i> stand here before you whole.
    </li>
    <li>This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the <i>eke</i> of the corner.
    </li>
    <li><i>Nishta</i> is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven <i>parkered</i> among <i>homies</i>, whereby we must be saved.
    </li>
    <li>Now when they <i>vardad</i> the boldness of <i>Petra</i> and <i>Jane</i>, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant <i>homies</i>, they marvelled; and they <i>lelled</i> knowledge of them, that they had been with <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And beholding the <i>homie</i> which was healed standing with them, they could <i>cackle</i> <i>nishter</i> against it.
    </li>
    <li>But when they had commanded them to <i>troll</i> aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackling</i>, What shall we do to these <i>homies</i>? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that <i>lett</i> in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.
    </li>
    <li>But that it spread no further among the <i>homies and palones</i>, let us <i>hettily</i> threaten them, that they <i>cackle</i> henceforth to no <i>homie</i> in this name.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>screeched</i> them, and commanded them not to <i>cackle</i> at all <i>nishta</i> teach in the name of <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>Petra</i> and <i>Jane</i> answered and <i>cackled</i> unto them, Whether it be <i>sweet</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of <i>Gloria</i> to <i>aunt nell</i> unto you more than unto <i>Gloria</i>, <i>beak</i> ye.
    </li>
    <li>For we cannot but <i>cackle</i> the <i>fakements</i> which we have <i>vardad</i> and <i>aunt nelled</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So when they had further threatened them, they let them <i>troll</i>, finding <i>nishter</i> how they might <i>zsa zsa</i> them, because of the <i>homies and palones</i>: for all <i>homies</i> glorified <i>Gloria</i> for that which was done.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>homie</i> was above <i>quarter dacha</i> years <i>badge</i>, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed.
    </li>
    <li>And being let <i>troll</i>, they <i>trolled</i> to their own company, and reported all that the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homies</i> and <i>fungi</i> had <i>cackled</i> unto them.
    </li>
    <li>And when they <i>aunt nelled</i> that, they lifted up their <i>cackling fakement</i> to <i>Gloria</i> with <i>una</i> accord, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, thou art <i>Gloria</i>, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:
    </li>
    <li>Who by the <i>screech</i> of thy <i>serving homie</i> <i>Davina</i> hast <i>cackled</i>, Why did the heathen rage, and the <i>homies and palones</i> imagine vain <i>fakements</i>?
    </li>
    <li>The <i>dowriest homies</i> of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the <i>Duchess</i>, and against <i>her</i> <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For of a truth against thy <i>fabulosa</i> <i>chavvie</i> <i>Josie</i>, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>, and the <i>homies and palones</i> of Israel, were gathered together,
    </li>
    <li>For to do whatsoever thy <i>famble</i> and thy counsel determined before to be done.
    </li>
    <li>And now, <i>Duchess</i>, <i>varda</i> their threatenings: and grant unto thy <i>serving homies</i>, that with all boldness they may <i>cackle</i> thy <i>lav</i>,
    </li>
    <li>By stretching forth thine <i>famble</i> to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy <i>fabulosa</i> <i>chavvie</i> <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>, and they <i>cackled</i> the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i> with boldness.
    </li>
    <li>And the multitude of them that believed were of <i>una</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> and of <i>una</i> <i>nishta lucoddy</i>: <i>nishta</i> <i>cackled</i> any of them that ought of the <i>fakements</i> which <i>she</i> possessed was <i>her</i> own; but they had all <i>fakements</i> common.
    </li>
    <li>And with <i>dowry</i> power <i>parkered</i> the apostles <i>varda-ing fakement</i> of the resurrection of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i>: and <i>dowry</i> <i>gracie</i> was upon them all.
    </li>
    <li><i>Nishta</i> was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or <i>latties</i> sold them, and brought the prices of the <i>fakements</i> that were sold,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>laued</i> them down at the apostles&#8217; <i>plates</i>: and distribution was made unto every <i>homie</i> according as <i>she</i> had need.
    </li>
    <li>And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The <i>homie chavvie</i> of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus,
    </li>
    <li>Having land, sold it, and brought the <i>dinarly</i>, and <i>laued</i> it at the apostles&#8217; <i>plates</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>But a certain <i>homie</i> named Ananias, with Sapphira <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>, sold a <i>fakement</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And kept back part of the price, <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i> also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and <i>laued</i> it at the apostles&#8217; <i>plates</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>Petra</i> <i>cackled</i>, Ananias, why hath <i>Sadie</i> filled thine <i>thumping cheat</i> to lie to the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>, and to keep back part of the price of the land?
    </li>
    <li>Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this <i>fakement</i> in thine <i>thumping cheat</i>? thou hast not lied unto <i>homies</i>, but unto <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Ananias hearing these <i>lavs</i> fell down, and <i>parkered</i> up the <i>fairy</i>: and <i>dowry</i> fear <i>trolled</i> on all them that <i>aunt nelled</i> these <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>bean coves</i> arose, wound <i>her</i> up, and <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> out, and buried <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And it was about the space of <i>trey</i> hours after, when <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>, not knowing what was done, <i>trolled</i> in.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Petra</i> answered unto her, <i>cackle</i> me whether ye sold the land for so <i>dowry</i>? And she <i>cackled</i>, <i>any road up</i>, for so <i>dowry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>Petra</i> <i>cackled</i> unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the <i>Fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>? <i>varda</i>, the <i>plates</i> of them which have buried thy <i>homie affair</i> are at the door, and shall carry thee out.
    </li>
    <li>Then fell she down straightway at <i>her</i> <i>plates</i>, and yielded up the <i>fairy</i>: and the <i>bean coves</i> <i>trolled</i> in, and found her <i>stiff</i>, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her <i>homie affair</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>dowry</i> fear <i>trolled</i> upon all the <i>meshigener carsey</i>, and upon as many as <i>aunt nelled</i> these <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And by the <i>fambles</i> of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the <i>homies and palones</i>; (and they were all with <i>una</i> accord in Solomon&#8217;s porch.
    </li>
    <li>And of the <i>lettie</i> durst no <i>homie</i> join himself to them: but the <i>homies and palones</i> magnified them.
    </li>
    <li>And believers were the more added to the <i>Duchess</i>, multitudes both of <i>homies</i> and <i>palones</i>. )
    </li>
    <li>Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and <i>laued</i> them on beds and couches, that at the <i>nanti dowriest</i> the shadow of <i>Petra</i> passing by might overshadow some of them.
    </li>
    <li>There <i>trolled</i> also a multitude out of the <i>smokes</i> round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with <i>nanti sparkle</i> <i>fairies</i>: and they were healed every <i>una</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then the high <i>godly homie</i> rose up, and all they that were with <i>her</i>, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>laued</i> their <i>fambles</i> on the apostles, and put them in the common <i>charpering carsey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> by <i>nochy</i> opened the <i>charpering carsey</i> doors, and brought them forth, and <i>cackled</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Troll</i>, stand and <i>cackle</i> in the <i>holy carsey</i> to the <i>homies and palones</i> all the <i>lavs</i> of this life.
    </li>
    <li>And when they <i>aunt nelled</i> that, they entered into the <i>holy carsey</i> early in the morning, and taught. But the high <i>godly homie</i> <i>trolled</i>, and they that were with <i>her</i>, and <i>screeched</i> the council together, and all the senate of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, and <i>laued</i> to the <i>charpering carsey</i> to have them brought.
    </li>
    <li>But when the <i>hilda handcuffs</i> <i>trolled</i>, and found them not in the <i>charpering carsey</i>, they <i>trolled back</i> and <i>cackled</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackling</i>, The <i>charpering carsey</i> truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing <i>nanti</i> before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no <i>homie</i> within.
    </li>
    <li>Now when the high <i>godly homie</i> and the captain of the <i>holy carsey</i> and the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homies</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> these <i>fakements</i>, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>trolled</i> <i>una</i> and <i>cackled</i> them, <i>cackling</i>, <i>varda</i>, the <i>homies</i> whom ye put in <i>charpering carsey</i> are standing in the <i>holy carsey</i>, and teaching the <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>trolled</i> the captain with the <i>hilda handcuffs</i>, and brought them <i>nanti</i> <i>slapping</i>: for they feared the <i>homies and palones</i>, lest they should have been stoned.
    </li>
    <li>And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high <i>godly homie</i> asked them,
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackling</i>, Did not we <i>hettily</i> command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, <i>varda</i>, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to <i>parker</i> this <i>homie</i>&#8216;s blood upon us.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>Petra</i> and the other apostles answered and <i>cackled</i>, We ought to obey <i>Gloria</i> rather than <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Gloria</i> of our <i>aunties</i> raised up <i>Josie</i>, whom ye <i>ferricadoozaed</i> and hanged on a tree.
    </li>
    <li><i>Her</i> hath <i>Gloria</i> exalted with <i>her</i> <i>sweet martini</i> to be a <i>princess</i> and a Saviour, for to <i>parker</i> repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of <i>kertervers</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And we are <i>her</i> witnesses of these <i>fakements</i>; and so is also the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>, whom <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>parkered</i> to them that obey <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>When they <i>aunt nelled</i> that, they were cut to the <i>thumping cheat</i>, and <i>lelled</i> counsel to <i>ferricadooza</i> them.
    </li>
    <li>Then stood there up <i>una</i> in the council, a <i>lily law</i>, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the <i>homies and palones</i>, and commanded to put the apostles forth a <i>bijou</i> space;
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackled</i> unto them, Ye <i>homies</i> of Israel, <i>lell</i> heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as <i>reefing</i> these <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of <i>homies</i>, about <i>quarter</i> <i>chenter</i>, joined themselves: who was <i>ferricadoozed</i>; and all, as many as obeyed <i>her</i>, were scattered, and brought to nought.
    </li>
    <li>After this <i>homie</i> rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away <i>dowry</i> <i>homies and palones</i> after <i>her</i>: <i>she</i> also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed <i>her</i>, were dispersed.
    </li>
    <li>And now I <i>cackle</i> unto you, Refrain from these <i>homies</i>, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this <i>acting dickey</i> be of <i>homies</i>, it will <i>troll</i> to nought:
    </li>
    <li>But if it be of <i>Gloria</i>, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to <i>palaver</i> against <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And to <i>her</i> they agreed: and when they had <i>screeched</i> the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not <i>cackle</i> in the name of <i>Josie</i>, and let them <i>troll</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>trolled off</i> from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted <i>bona</i> to suffer <i>scharda</i> for <i>her</i> name.
    </li>
    <li>And daily in the <i>holy carsey</i>, and in every <i>lattie</i>, they ceased not to teach and <i>cackle</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the <i>Kosher Homies and Palones</i>, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>kenza</i> <i>screeched</i> the multitude of the disciples unto them, and <i>cackled</i>, It is not reason that we should leave the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and serve tables.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore, <i>sisters</i>, <i>varda</i> ye out among you <i>setter</i> <i>homies</i> of honest report, full of the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i> and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.
    </li>
    <li>But we will <i>parker</i> ourselves continually to <i>meshigener muttering</i>, and to the ministry of the <i>lav</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>cackling</i> pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a <i>homie</i> full of faith and of the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>, and <i>Phyllis</i>, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:
    </li>
    <li>Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they <i>laued</i> their <i>fambles</i> on them.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i> increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a <i>dowry</i> company of the <i>godly homies</i> were obedient to the faith.
    </li>
    <li>And Stephen, full of faith and power, did <i>dowry</i> wonders and miracles among the <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is <i>screeched</i> the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.
    </li>
    <li>And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the <i>Fairy</i> by which <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then they suborned <i>homies</i>, which <i>cackled</i>, We have <i>aunt nelled</i> <i>her</i> <i>cackle</i> blasphemous <i>lavs</i> against <i>Maureen</i>, and against <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they stirred up the <i>homies and palones</i>, and the <i>fungi</i>, and the <i>betty bracelets</i>, and <i>trolled</i> upon <i>her</i>, and caught <i>her</i>, and brought <i>her</i> to the council,
    </li>
    <li>And set up false witnesses, which <i>cackled</i>, This <i>homie</i> ceaseth not to <i>cackle</i> blasphemous <i>lavs</i> against this <i>fabulosa</i> place, and the law:
    </li>
    <li>For we have <i>aunt nelled</i> <i>her</i> <i>cackle</i>, that this <i>Josie</i> of Nazareth shall <i>battyfang</i> this place, and shall change the customs which <i>Maureen</i> <i>laued</i> us.
    </li>
    <li>And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on <i>her</i>, <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> as it had been the <i>eke</i> of an <i>fairy</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> the high <i>godly homie</i>, Are these <i>fakements</i> so?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>homies</i>, <i>sisters</i>, and <i>aunties</i>, <i>aunt nell</i>; The <i>Gloria</i> of <i>fabeness</i> appeared unto our <i>Auntie</i> Abraham, when <i>she</i> was in Mesopotamia, before <i>she</i> <i>letted</i> in Charran,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and <i>troll</i> into the land which I shall shew thee.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>trolled</i> <i>she</i> out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and <i>letted</i> in Charran: and from thence, when <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> was <i>stiff</i>, <i>she</i> removed <i>her</i> into this land, wherein ye now <i>lett</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> none inheritance in it, no, not so <i>dowry</i> as to set <i>her</i> <i>plate</i> on: yet <i>she</i> promised that <i>she</i> would <i>parker</i> it to <i>her</i> for a <i>fakement</i>, and to <i>her</i> <i>maria</i> after <i>her</i>, when as yet <i>she</i> had no <i>chavvie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i> on this wise, That <i>her</i> <i>maria</i> should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should <i>parker</i> them into bondage, and entreat them <i>nana</i> <i>quarter</i> <i>chenter</i> years.
    </li>
    <li>And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I <i>beak</i>, <i>cackled</i> <i>Gloria</i>: and after that shall they <i>troll</i> forth, and serve me in this place.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham <i>chavvied</i> Isaac, and <i>roundhead</i> <i>her</i> the <i>otterth</i> <i>journo</i>; and Isaac <i>chavvied</i> Jacob; and Jacob <i>chavvied</i> the <i>kenza</i> patriarchs.
    </li>
    <li>And the patriarchs, <i>trolled</i> with envy, sold <i>Josephine</i> into Egypt: but <i>Gloria</i> was with <i>her</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> out of all <i>her</i> afflictions, and <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> favour and wisdom in the <i>vardaing</i> of Pharaoh <i>dowriest homie</i> of Egypt; and <i>she</i> made <i>her</i> governor over Egypt and all <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now there <i>trolled</i> a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan, and <i>dowry</i> affliction: and our <i>aunties</i> found no sustenance.
    </li>
    <li>But when Jacob <i>aunt nelled</i> that there was corn in Egypt, <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> out our <i>aunties</i> first.
    </li>
    <li>And at the second time <i>Josephine</i> was made known to <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>; and <i>Josephine</i>&#8216;s kindred was made known unto Pharaoh.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>laued</i> <i>Josephine</i>, and <i>screeched</i> <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> Jacob to <i>her</i>, and all <i>her</i> kindred, <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> and fifteen <i>nishta lucoddies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So Jacob <i>trolled</i> down into Egypt, and <i>carked it</i>, <i>she</i>, and our <i>aunties</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And were <i>lelled</i> over into Sychem, and <i>laued</i> in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of <i>dinarly</i> of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Emmor the <i>Auntie</i> of Sychem.
    </li>
    <li>But when the time of the promise drew <i>ajax</i>, which <i>Gloria</i> had sworn to Abraham, the <i>homies and palones</i> grew and multiplied in Egypt,
    </li>
    <li>Till another <i>dowriest homie</i> arose, which knew not <i>Josephine</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and <i>nana</i> entreated our <i>aunties</i>, so that they cast out their <i>bean</i> <i>chavvies</i>, to the end they might not live.
    </li>
    <li>In which time <i>Maureen</i> was born, and was exceeding <i>filly</i>, and nourished up in <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i> <i>trey</i> months:
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> was cast out, Pharaoh&#8217;s <i>palone chavvie</i> <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> up, and nourished <i>her</i> for her own <i>homie chavvie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Maureen</i> was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was <i>dowry butch</i> in <i>lavs</i> and in deeds.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> was full <i>quarter dacha</i> years <i>badge</i>, it <i>trolled</i> into <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> to visit <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i> the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>vardaing</i> <i>una</i> of them suffer wrong, <i>she</i> defended <i>her</i>, and avenged <i>her</i> that was oppressed, and <i>slapped</i> the Egyptian:
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> supposed <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i> would have understood how that <i>Gloria</i> by <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> would deliver them: but they understood not.
    </li>
    <li>And the next <i>journo</i> <i>she</i> shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at <i>una</i> again, <i>cackling</i>, Sirs, ye are <i>sisters</i>; why do ye wrong <i>una</i> to another?
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> that did <i>her</i> <i>homie ajax</i> wrong thrust <i>her</i> away, <i>cackling</i>, Who made thee a ruler and a <i>beak</i> over us?
    </li>
    <li>Wilt thou <i>ferricadoza</i> me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?
    </li>
    <li>Then fled <i>Maureen</i> at this <i>cackling</i>, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where <i>she</i> <i>chavvied</i> <i>dewey</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>quarter dacha</i> years were expired, there appeared to <i>her</i> in the <i>nishta smoke</i> of mount Sina an <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> in a flame of <i>binco fakement</i> in a bush.
    </li>
    <li>When <i>Maureen</i> <i>vardad</i> it, <i>she</i> wondered at the <i>vardaing</i>: and as <i>she</i> drew near to <i>varda</i> it, the <i>cackling fakement</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> unto <i>her</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackling</i>, I am the <i>Gloria</i> of thy <i>aunties</i>, the <i>Gloria</i> of Abraham, and the <i>Gloria</i> of Isaac, and the <i>Gloria</i> of Jacob. Then <i>Maureen</i> trembled, and durst not <i>varda</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> the <i>Duchess</i> to <i>her</i>, Put off thy <i>slingbacks</i> from thy <i>plates</i>: for the place where thou standest is <i>fabulosa</i> ground.
    </li>
    <li>I have <i>vardad</i>, I have <i>vardad</i> the affliction of my <i>homies and palones</i> which is in Egypt, and I have <i>aunt nelled</i> their groaning, and am <i>troll</i> down to deliver them. And now <i>troll</i>, I will <i>lau</i> thee into Egypt.
    </li>
    <li>This <i>Maureen</i> whom they refused, <i>cackling</i>, Who made thee a ruler and a <i>beak</i>? the same did <i>Gloria</i> <i>lau</i> to be a ruler and a deliverer by the <i>famble</i> of the <i>fairy</i> which appeared to <i>her</i> in the bush.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> brought them out, after that <i>she</i> had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the <i>nishta smoke</i> <i>quarter dacha</i> years.
    </li>
    <li>This is that <i>Maureen</i>, which <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, A prophet shall the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i> raise up unto you of your <i>sisters</i>, like unto me; <i>her</i> shall ye <i>aunt nell</i>.
    </li>
    <li>This is <i>she</i>, that was in the <i>meshigener carsey</i> in the <i>nishta smoke</i> with the <i>fairy</i> which <i>cackled</i> to <i>her</i> in the mount Sina, and with our <i>aunties</i>: who <i>lalled</i> the lively oracles to <i>parker</i> unto us:
    </li>
    <li>To whom our <i>aunties</i> would not obey, but thrust <i>her</i> from them, and in their <i>thumping cheats</i> turned back again into Egypt,
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackling</i> unto Aaron, Make us gods to <i>troll</i> before us: for as for this <i>Maureen</i>, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they made a calf in those days, and offered <i>parker</i> unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own <i>fambles</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>Gloria</i> turned, and <i>parkered</i> them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the prophets, O ye <i>lattie</i> of Israel, have ye offered to me <i>ferricadoozed</i> beasts and <i>parkers</i> by the space of <i>quarter dacha</i> years in the <i>nishta smoke</i>?
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, ye <i>lelled</i> up the <i>bijou tabernaclette</i> of Moloch, and the <i>twinkling fakement</i> of your <i>Gloria</i> Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.
    </li>
    <li>Our <i>aunties</i> had the <i>bijou tabernaclette</i> of <i>varda-ing fakement</i> in the <i>nishta smoke</i>, as <i>she</i> had appointed, speaking unto <i>Maureen</i>, that <i>she</i> should make it according to the fashion that <i>she</i> had <i>vardad</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Which also our <i>aunties</i> that <i>trolled</i> after brought in with <i>Josie</i> into the <i>fakement</i> of the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>, whom <i>Gloria</i> drave out before the <i>eke</i> of our <i>aunties</i>, unto the days of <i>Davina</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Who found favour before <i>Gloria</i>, and <i>fancied</i> to find a <i>bijou tabernaclette</i> for the <i>Gloria</i> of Jacob.
    </li>
    <li>But Solomon built <i>her</i> an <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Howbeit the most High <i>letteth</i> not in temples made with <i>fambles</i>; as <i>cackleth</i> the prophet,
    </li>
    <li>Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what <i>lattie</i> will ye build me? <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>: or what is the place of my <i>lettie</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Hath not my <i>famble</i> made all these <i>fakements</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Ye stiffnecked and <i>cavalier</i> in <i>thumping cheat</i> and <i>aunt nelly cheats</i>, ye do always resist the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>: as your <i>aunties</i> did, so do ye.
    </li>
    <li>Which of the prophets have not your <i>aunties</i> <i>chivvied</i>? and they have <i>ferricadoozed</i> them which shewed before of the <i>trolling</i> of the Just <i>una</i>; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers:
    </li>
    <li>Who have <i>lalled</i> the law by the disposition of <i>fairies</i>, and have not kept it.
    </li>
    <li>When they <i>aunt nelled</i> these <i>fakements</i>, they were cut to the <i>thumping cheat</i>, and they gnashed on <i>her</i> with their <i>hampsteads</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i>, being full of the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and <i>vardad</i> the <i>fabeness</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and <i>Josie</i> standing on the <i>sweet martini</i> of <i>Gloria</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, I <i>varda</i> the heavens opened, and the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> standing on the <i>sweet martini</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then they <i>screeched</i> out with a loud <i>cackling fakement</i>, and stopped their <i>aunt nelly cheats</i>, and ran upon <i>her</i> with <i>una</i> accord,
    </li>
    <li>And cast <i>her</i> out of the <i>smoke</i>, and stoned <i>her</i>: and the witnesses <i>laued</i> down their <i>zhoosh</i> at a <i>bean cove</i>&#8216;s <i>plates</i>, whose name was Saul.
    </li>
    <li>And they stoned Stephen, calling upon <i>Gloria</i>, and <i>cackling</i>, <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i>, <i>lall</i> my <i>Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> kneeled down, and <i>screeched</i> with a loud <i>cackling fakement</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, <i>lett</i> not this <i>kertever</i> to their charge. And when <i>she</i> had <i>cackled</i> this, <i>she</i> fell asleep.

    <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And Saul was consenting unto <i>her</i> <i>carking it</i>. And at that time there was a <i>dowry</i> <i>chivvying</i> against the <i>meshigener carsey</i> which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.
    </li>
    <li>And devout <i>homies</i> <i>lelled</i> Stephen to <i>her</i> burial, and made <i>dowry</i> lamentation over <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>As for Saul, <i>she</i> made havock of the <i>meshigener carsey</i>, entering into every <i>lattie</i>, and haling <i>homies</i> and <i>palones</i> committed them to <i>charpering carsey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore they that were scattered abroad <i>trolled</i> every where <i>cackling</i> the <i>lav</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>Phyllis</i> <i>trolled</i> down to the <i>smoke</i> of Samaria, and <i>cackled</i> <i>Crystal</i> unto them.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>homies and palones</i> with <i>una</i> accord <i>parkered</i> heed unto those <i>fakements</i> which <i>Phyllis</i> <i>cackled</i>, hearing and <i>vardaing</i> the miracles which <i>she</i> did.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>nanti sparkle</i> <i>fairies</i>, <i>screeching</i> with loud <i>cackling fakement</i>, <i>trolled</i> out of many that were possessed with them: and many <i>lelled</i> with palsies, and that were <i>nanti wallop</i>, were healed.
    </li>
    <li>And there was <i>dowry</i> joy in that <i>smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But there was a certain <i>homie</i>, <i>screeched</i> <i>Simone</i>, which beforetime in the same <i>smoke</i> used sorcery, and bewitched the <i>homies and palones</i> of Samaria, giving out that himself was some <i>dowry</i> <i>una</i>:
    </li>
    <li>To whom they all <i>parkered</i> heed, from the <i>nanti dowriest</i> to the <i>dowriest</i>, <i>cackling</i>, This <i>homie</i> is the <i>dowry</i> power of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And to <i>her</i> they had regard, because that of long time <i>she</i> had bewitched them with sorceries.
    </li>
    <li>But when they believed <i>Phyllis</i> <i>cackling</i> the <i>fakements</i> concerning the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>, and the name of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, they were baptized, both <i>homies</i> and <i>palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>Simone</i> himself believed also: and when <i>she</i> was baptized, <i>she</i> continued with <i>Phyllis</i>, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.
    </li>
    <li>Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem <i>aunt nelled</i> that Samaria had <i>lalled</i> the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, they <i>laued</i> unto them <i>Petra</i> and <i>Jane</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Who, when they were <i>troll</i> down, prayed for them, that they might <i>lall</i> the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>:
    </li>
    <li>(For as yet <i>she</i> was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i>. )
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>laued</i> they their <i>fambles</i> on them, and they <i>lalled</i> the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>Simone</i> <i>vardad</i> that through laying on of the apostles&#8217; <i>fambles</i> the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i> was <i>parkered</i>, <i>she</i> offered them <i>dinarly</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackling</i>, <i>parker</i> me also this power, that on whomsoever I <i>lett</i> <i>fambles</i>, <i>she</i> may <i>lall</i> the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>Petra</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Thy <i>dinarly</i> perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of <i>Gloria</i> may be purchased with <i>dinarly</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thou hast <i>nishta</i> part <i>nishta</i> lot in this matter: for thy <i>thumping cheat</i> is not <i>sweet</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Repent therefore of this thy <i>naffness</i>, and pray <i>Gloria</i>, if perhaps the thought of thine <i>thumping cheat</i> may be forgiven thee.
    </li>
    <li>For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of <i>codness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then answered <i>Simone</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Pray ye to the <i>Duchess</i> for me, that none of these <i>fakements</i> which ye have <i>cackled</i> <i>troll</i> upon me.
    </li>
    <li>And they, when they had testified and <i>cackled</i> the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>trolled back to</i> Jerusalem, and <i>cackled</i> the <i>gossip</i> in many villages of the Samaritans.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Phyllis</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Arise, and <i>troll</i> toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> arose and <i>trolled</i>: and, <i>varda</i>, a <i>homie</i> of Ethiopia, an eunuch of <i>dowry</i> authority under Candace <i>dowriest palone</i> of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her <i>gelt</i>, and had <i>troll</i> to Jerusalem for to worship,
    </li>
    <li>Was returning, and sitting in <i>her</i> <i>trundling cheat</i> <i>varda the lavs</i> Esaias the prophet.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>Fairy</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Phyllis</i>, <i>troll</i> near, and join thyself to this <i>trundling cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Phyllis</i> ran thither to <i>her</i>, and <i>aunt nelled</i> <i>her</i> <i>varda the lavs</i> the prophet Esaias, and <i>cackled</i>, Understandest thou what thou readest?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, How can I, except some <i>homie</i> should guide me? And <i>she</i> <i>fancied</i> <i>Phyllis</i> that <i>she</i> would <i>troll</i> up and <i>lett</i> with <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The place of the <i>glossy</i> which <i>she</i> <i>varda the lavs</i> was this, <i>she</i> was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb <i>nanti polari</i> before <i>her</i> shearer, so opened <i>she</i> not <i>her</i> <i>screech</i>:
    </li>
    <li>In <i>her</i> humiliation <i>her</i> judgment was <i>lelled</i> away: and who shall <i>screech</i> <i>her</i> generation? for <i>her</i> life is <i>lelled</i> from the earth.
    </li>
    <li>And the eunuch answered <i>Phyllis</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, I pray thee, of whom <i>cackleth</i> the prophet this? of himself, or of some other <i>homie</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>Phyllis</i> opened <i>her</i> <i>screech</i>, and began at the same <i>glossy</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And as they <i>trolled</i> on their way, they <i>trolled</i> unto a certain <i>aqua</i>: and the eunuch <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, here is <i>aqua</i>; what doth hinder me to be baptized?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Phyllis</i> <i>cackled</i>, If thou believest with all thine <i>thumping cheat</i>, thou mayest. And <i>she</i> answered and <i>cackled</i>, I believe that <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> is the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> commanded the <i>trundling cheat</i> to stand still: and they <i>trolled</i> down both into the <i>aqua</i>, both <i>Phyllis</i> and the eunuch; and <i>she</i> baptized <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when they were <i>troll</i> up out of the <i>aqua</i>, the <i>Fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> caught away <i>Phyllis</i>, that the eunuch <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i> <i>nishta</i>: and <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> on <i>her</i> way rejoicing.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>Phyllis</i> was found at Azotus: and passing through <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> in all the <i>smokes</i>, till <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> to Caesarea.

    <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>trolled</i> unto the high <i>godly homie</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>fancied</i> of <i>her</i> letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if <i>she</i> found any of this way, whether they were <i>homies</i> or <i>palones</i>, <i>she</i> might <i>parker</i> them bound unto Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And as <i>she</i> journeyed, <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about <i>her</i> a <i>sparkle</i> from heaven:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> fell to the earth, and <i>aunt nelled</i> a <i>cackling fakement</i> <i>cackling</i> unto <i>her</i>, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Who art thou, <i>Duchess</i>? And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i>, I am <i>Josie</i> whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> trembling and <i>gobsmacked</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, what wilt thou have me to do? And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Arise, and <i>troll</i> into the <i>smoke</i>, and it shall be <i>cackled</i> thee what thou must do.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>homies</i> which journeyed with <i>her</i> stood speechless, hearing a <i>cackling fakement</i>, but <i>vardaing</i> no <i>homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Saul arose from the earth; and when <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i> were opened, <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> no <i>homie</i>: but they led <i>her</i> by the <i>famble</i>, and brought <i>her</i> into Damascus.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> was <i>trey</i> days <i>nanti</i> <i>vardaing</i>, and <i>nishta</i> did <i>jarry</i> <i>nishta</i> <i>buvare</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to <i>her</i> <i>cackled</i> the <i>Duchess</i> in a vision, Ananias. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, I am here, <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Arise, and <i>troll</i> into the street which is <i>screeched</i> <i>hettie</i>, and enquire in the <i>lattie</i> of Judas for <i>una</i> <i>screeched</i> Saul, of Tarsus: for, <i>varda</i>, <i>she</i> prayeth,
    </li>
    <li>And hath <i>vardad</i> in a vision a <i>homie</i> named Ananias <i>trolling</i> in, and putting <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> on <i>her</i>, that <i>she</i> might <i>lall</i> <i>her</i> <i>vardaing</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then Ananias answered, <i>Duchess</i>, I have <i>aunt nelled</i> by many of this <i>homie</i>, how <i>dowry</i> <i>nana</i> <i>she</i> hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:
    </li>
    <li>And here <i>she</i> hath authority from the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homies</i> to bind all that <i>screech</i> on thy name.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>troll</i> thy way: for <i>she</i> is a chosen <i>fakement</i> unto me, to bear my name before the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>, and <i>dowriest homies</i>, and the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel:
    </li>
    <li>For I will shew <i>her</i> how <i>dowry</i> <i>fakements</i> <i>she</i> must suffer for my name&#8217;s sake.
    </li>
    <li>And Ananias <i>trolled</i> <i>her</i> way, and entered into the <i>lattie</i>; and putting <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i> on <i>her</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>sister</i> Saul, the <i>Duchess</i>, even <i>Josie</i>, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath <i>laued</i> me, that thou mightest <i>lall</i> thy <i>vardaing</i>, and be filled with the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And immediately there fell from <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i> as it had been scales: and <i>she</i> <i>lalled</i> <i>vardaing</i> forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> had <i>lalled</i> <i>carnish</i>, <i>she</i> was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus.
    </li>
    <li>And straightway <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> <i>Crystal</i> in the synagogues, that <i>she</i> is the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But all that <i>aunt nelled</i> <i>her</i> were <i>gobsmacked</i>, and <i>cackled</i>; Is not this <i>she</i> that <i>battyfanged</i> them which <i>screeched</i> on this name in Jerusalem, and <i>trolled</i> hither for that intent, that <i>she</i> might <i>parker</i> them bound unto the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homies</i>?
    </li>
    <li>But Saul increased the more in <i>butchness</i>, and <i>bamboozled</i> the <i>kosher homies</i> which <i>letted</i> at Damascus, proving that this is <i>dowry</i> <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And after that many days were fulfilled, the <i>kosher homies</i> <i>lelled</i> counsel to <i>ferricadoza</i> <i>her</i>:
    </li>
    <li>But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates <i>journo</i> and <i>nochy</i> to <i>ferricadoza</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then the disciples <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> by <i>nochy</i>, and let <i>her</i> down by the wall in a basket.
    </li>
    <li>And when Saul was <i>troll</i> to Jerusalem, <i>she</i> assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of <i>her</i>, and believed not that <i>she</i> was a disciple.
    </li>
    <li>But Barnabas <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i>, and brought <i>her</i> to the apostles, and <i>screeched</i> unto them how <i>she</i> had <i>vardad</i> the <i>Duchess</i> in the way, and that <i>she</i> had <i>cackled</i> to <i>her</i>, and how <i>she</i> had <i>cackled</i> boldly at Damascus in the name of <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> was with them <i>trolling</i> in and going out at Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> boldly in the name of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i>, and disputed against the Grecians: but they <i>trolled</i> about to <i>ferricadooza</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Which when the <i>sisters</i> knew, they brought <i>her</i> down to Caesarea, and <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> forth to Tarsus.
    </li>
    <li>Then had the <i>meshigener carseys</i> <i>lettie</i> throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and <i>mincing</i> in the fear of the <i>Duchess</i>, and in the comfort of the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>, were multiplied.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, as <i>Petra</i> passed throughout all quarters, <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> down also to the saints which <i>letted</i> at Lydda.
    </li>
    <li>And there <i>she</i> found a certain <i>homie</i> named Aeneas, which had kept <i>her</i> bed <i>say dooe</i> years, and was sick of the palsy.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Petra</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Aeneas, <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed. And <i>she</i> arose immediately.
    </li>
    <li>And all that <i>letted</i> at Lydda and Saron <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i>, and turned to the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is <i>screeched</i> Dorcas: this <i>palone</i> was full of <i>bona</i> works and almsdeeds which she did.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> in those days, that she was sick, and <i>carked it</i>: whom when they had <i>dhobied</i>, they <i>laued</i> her in an upper <i>booth</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And forasmuch as Lydda was <i>ajax</i> to Joppa, and the disciples had <i>aunt nelled</i> that <i>Petra</i> was there, they <i>laued</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>dewey</i> <i>homies</i>, desiring <i>her</i> that <i>she</i> would not delay to <i>troll</i> to them.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>Petra</i> arose and <i>trolled</i> with them. When <i>she</i> was <i>troll</i>, they brought <i>her</i> into the upper <i>booth</i>: and all the widows stood by <i>her</i> weeping, and shewing the coats and <i>frocks</i> which Dorcas made, while she was with them.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>Petra</i> put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning <i>her</i> to the <i>lucoddy</i> <i>cackled</i>, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her <i>ogles</i>: and when she <i>vardad</i> <i>Petra</i>, she sat up.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> her <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>, and lifted her up, and when <i>she</i> had <i>screeched</i> the saints and widows, presented her alive.
    </li>
    <li>And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, that <i>she</i> tarried many days in Joppa with <i>una</i> <i>Simone</i> a tanner.

    <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>There was a certain <i>homie</i> in Caesarea <i>screeched</i> Cornelius, a centurion of the band <i>screeched</i> the Italian band,

    <li>A devout <i>homie</i>, and <i>una</i> that feared <i>Gloria</i> with all <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>, which <i>parkered</i> <i>dowry</i> alms to the <i>homies and palones</i>, and prayed to <i>Gloria</i> alway.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> <i>vardad</i> in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the <i>journo</i> an <i>fairy</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>trolling</i> in to <i>her</i>, and <i>cackling</i> unto <i>her</i>, Cornelius.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> looked on <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> was afraid, and <i>cackled</i>, What is it, <i>Duchess</i>? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Thy <i>meshigener mutterings</i> and thine alms are <i>troll</i> up for a memorial before <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And now <i>lau</i> <i>homies</i> to Joppa, and <i>screech</i> for <i>una</i> <i>Simone</i>, whose surname is <i>Petra</i>:

    <li><i>She</i> lodgeth with <i>una</i> <i>Simone</i> a tanner, whose <i>lattie</i> is by the sea side: <i>she</i> shall <i>cackle</i> thee what thou oughtest to do.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>fairy</i> which <i>cackled</i> unto Cornelius was <i>trolled off</i>, <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> <i>dewey</i> of <i>her</i> household <i>serving homies</i>, and a devout <i>butch homie</i> of them that waited on <i>her</i> continually;

    <li>And when <i>she</i> had <i>screeched</i> all these <i>fakements</i> unto them, <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> them to Joppa.
    </li>
    <li>On the morrow, as they <i>trolled</i> on their journey, and drew <i>ajax</i> unto the <i>smoke</i>, <i>Petra</i> <i>trolled</i> up upon the housetop to pray about the <i>seyth</i> hour:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> became <i>dowry</i> hungry, and would have <i>jarried</i>: but while they made ready, <i>she</i> fell into a trance,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>vardad</i> heaven opened, and a certain <i>fakement</i> <i>trolling down</i> upon <i>her</i>, as it had been a <i>dowry</i> sheet knit at the <i>quarter</i> corners, and let down to the earth:
    </li>
    <li>Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping <i>fakements</i>, and fowls of the air.
    </li>
    <li>And there <i>trolled</i> a <i>cackling fakement</i> to <i>her</i>, Rise, <i>Petra</i>; <i>ferricadoza</i>, and <i>jarry</i>.

    <li>But <i>Petra</i> <i>cackled</i>, Not so, <i>Duchess</i>; for I have never <i>jarried</i> any <i>fakement</i> that is common or <i>nanti sparkle</i>.

    <li>And the <i>cackling fakement</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> again the second time, What <i>Gloria</i> hath cleansed, that <i>screech</i> not thou common.

    <li>This was done thrice: and the <i>fakement</i> was <i>lalled</i> up again into heaven.
    </li>
    <li>Now while <i>Petra</i> doubted in himself what this vision which <i>she</i> had <i>vardad</i> should mean, <i>varda</i>, the <i>homies</i> which were <i>laued</i> from Cornelius had made enquiry for <i>Simone</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, and stood before the gate,

    <li>And <i>screeched</i>, and asked whether <i>Simone</i>, which was surnamed <i>Petra</i>, were lodged there.

    <li>While <i>Petra</i> thought on the vision, the <i>Fairy</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>varda</i>, <i>trey</i> <i>homies</i> <i>charper</i> thee.
    </li>
    <li>Arise therefore, and get thee down, and <i>troll</i> with them, doubting <i>nishter</i>: for I have <i>laued</i> them.

    <li>Then <i>Petra</i> <i>trolled</i> down to the <i>homies</i> which were <i>laued</i> unto <i>her</i> from Cornelius; and <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, I am <i>she</i> whom ye <i>charper</i>: what is the cause wherefore ye are <i>troll</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>cackled</i>, Cornelius the centurion, a just <i>homie</i>, and <i>una</i> that feareth <i>Gloria</i>, and of <i>bona</i> report among all the nation of the <i>kosher homies</i>, was warned from <i>Gloria</i> by an <i>fabulosa</i> <i>fairy</i> to <i>lau</i> for thee into <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>, and to <i>aunt nell</i> <i>lavs</i> of thee.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>screeched</i> <i>she</i> them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow <i>Petra</i> <i>trolled</i> away with them, and certain <i>sisters</i> from Joppa accompanied <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and <i>she</i> had <i>screeched</i> together <i>her</i> kinsmen and near <i>bencoves</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And as <i>Petra</i> was <i>trolling</i> in, Cornelius met <i>her</i>, and fell down at <i>her</i> <i>plates</i>, and worshipped <i>her</i>.

    <li>But <i>Petra</i> <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> up, <i>cackling</i>, Stand up; I myself also am a <i>homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And as <i>she</i> talked with <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> in, and found many that were <i>troll</i> together.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful <i>fakement</i> for a <i>homie</i> that is a <i>kosher homie</i> to keep company, or <i>troll</i> unto <i>una</i> of another nation; but <i>Gloria</i> hath shewed me that I should not <i>screech</i> any <i>homie</i> common or <i>nanti sparkle</i>.

    <li>Therefore <i>trolled</i> I unto you <i>nanti</i> gainsaying, as soon as I was <i>laued</i> for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have <i>laued</i> for me?
    </li>
    <li>And Cornelius <i>cackled</i>, <i>quarter</i> days ago I was <i>nistha manjarrying</i> until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my <i>lattie</i>, and, <i>varda</i>, a <i>homie</i> stood before me in bright clothing,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackled</i>, Cornelius, thy <i>meshigener muttering</i> is <i>aunt nelled</i>, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the <i>vardaing</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.

    <li><i>Lau</i> therefore to Joppa, and <i>screech</i> hither <i>Simone</i>, whose surname is <i>Petra</i>; <i>she</i> is lodged in the <i>lattie</i> of <i>una</i> <i>Simone</i> a tanner by the sea side: who, when <i>she</i> <i>trolleth</i>, shall <i>cackle</i> unto thee.

    <li>Immediately therefore I <i>laued</i> to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art <i>troll</i>. Now therefore are we all here present before <i>Gloria</i>, to <i>aunt nell</i> all <i>fakements</i> that are commanded thee of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>Petra</i> opened <i>her</i> <i>screech</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Of a truth I perceive that <i>Gloria</i> is no respecter of persons:
    </li>
    <li>But in every nation <i>she</i> that feareth <i>her</i>, and worketh <i>bonaness</i>, is accepted with <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>lav</i> which <i>Gloria</i> <i>laued</i> unto the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, <i>cackling</i> peace by <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>: (<i>she</i> is <i>Duchess</i> of all:)
    </li>
    <li>That <i>lav</i>, I <i>cackle</i>, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which <i>Jane</i> <i>cackled</i>;
    </li>
    <li>How <i>Gloria</i> anointed <i>Josie</i> of Nazareth with the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i> and with power: who <i>trolled</i> about doing <i>bona</i>, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for <i>Gloria</i> was with <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And we are witnesses of all <i>fakements</i> which <i>she</i> did both in the land of the <i>kosher homies</i>, and in Jerusalem; whom they <i>ferricadoozaed</i> and hanged on a tree:
    </li>
    <li><i>Her</i> <i>Gloria</i> raised up the third <i>journo</i>, and shewed <i>her</i> openly;
    </li>
    <li>Not to all the <i>homies and palones</i>, but unto witnesses chosen before <i>Gloria</i>, even to us, who did <i>jarry</i> and <i>buvare</i> with <i>her</i> after <i>she</i> rose from the <i>stiff</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> commanded us to <i>cackle</i> unto the <i>homies and palones</i>, and to testify that it is <i>she</i> which was ordained of <i>Gloria</i> to be the <i>beak</i> of quick and <i>stiff</i>.
    </li>
    <li>To <i>her</i> <i>parker</i> all the prophets <i>varda-ing fakement</i>, that through <i>her</i> name whosoever believeth in <i>her</i> shall <i>lall</i> remission of <i>kertervers</i>.
    </li>
    <li>While <i>Petra</i> yet <i>cackled</i> these <i>lavs</i>, the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i> fell on all them which <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>lav</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they of the circumcision which believed were <i>gobsmacked</i>, as many as <i>trolled</i> with <i>Petra</i>, because that on the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> also was poured out the gift of the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For they <i>aunt nelled</i> them <i>cackle</i> with <i>polaris</i>, and magnify <i>Gloria</i>. Then answered <i>Petra</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Can any <i>homie</i> forbid <i>aqua</i>, that these should not be baptized, which have <i>lalled</i> the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i> as well as we?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> commanded them to be baptized in the name of the <i>Duchess</i>. Then prayed they <i>her</i> to tarry certain days.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And the apostles and <i>sisters</i> that were in Judaea <i>aunt nelled</i> that the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> had also <i>lalled</i> the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>Petra</i> was <i>troll</i> up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with <i>her</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackling</i>, Thou wentest in to <i>homies</i> <i>cavalier</i>, and didst <i>jarry</i> with them.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>Petra</i> rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order unto them, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>I was in the <i>smoke</i> of Joppa praying: and in a trance I <i>vardad</i> a vision, A certain <i>fakement</i> <i>troll down</i>, as it had been a <i>dowry</i> sheet, let down from heaven by <i>quarter</i> corners; and it <i>trolled</i> even to me:
    </li>
    <li>Upon the which when I had fastened mine <i>ogles</i>, I considered, and <i>vardad</i> fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping <i>fakements</i>, and fowls of the air.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>aunt nelled</i> a <i>cackling fakement</i> <i>cackling</i> unto me, Arise, <i>Petra</i>; <i>ferricadooza</i> and <i>jarry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But I <i>cackled</i>, Not so, <i>Duchess</i>: for <i>nishter</i> common or <i>nanti sparkle</i> hath at any time entered into my <i>screech</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>cackling fakement</i> answered me again from heaven, What <i>Gloria</i> hath cleansed, that <i>screech</i> not thou common.
    </li>
    <li>And this was done <i>trey</i> times: and all were drawn up again into heaven.
    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, immediately there were <i>trey</i> <i>homies</i> already <i>troll</i> unto the <i>lattie</i> where I was, <i>laued</i> from Caesarea unto me.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Fairy</i> bade me <i>troll</i> with them, <i>nishter</i> doubting. Moreover these <i>sey</i> <i>sisters</i> accompanied me, and we entered into the <i>homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> shewed us how <i>she</i> had <i>vardad</i> an <i>fairy</i> in <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>, which stood and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>lau</i> <i>homies</i> to Joppa, and <i>screech</i> for <i>Simone</i>, whose surname is <i>Petra</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Who shall <i>cackle</i> thee <i>lavs</i>, whereby thou and all thy <i>lattie</i> shall be saved.
    </li>
    <li>And as I began to <i>cackle</i>, the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i> fell on them, as on us at the beginning.
    </li>
    <li>Then remembered I the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, how that <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>Jane</i> indeed baptized with <i>aqua</i>; but ye shall be baptized with the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Forasmuch then as <i>Gloria</i> <i>parkered</i> them the like gift as <i>she</i> did unto us, who believed on the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>; what was I, that I could withstand <i>Gloria</i>?
    </li>
    <li>When they <i>aunt nelled</i> these <i>fakements</i>, they held their peace, and glorified <i>Gloria</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Then hath <i>Gloria</i> also to the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> granted repentance unto life.
    </li>
    <li>Now they which were scattered abroad upon the <i>chivvying</i> that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, <i>cackling</i> the <i>lav</i> to none but unto the <i>kosher homies</i> only.
    </li>
    <li>And some of them were <i>homies</i> of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were <i>troll</i> to Antioch, <i>cackled</i> unto the Grecians, <i>cackling</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>famble</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> was with them: and a <i>dowry</i> number believed, and turned unto the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then tidings of these <i>fakements</i> <i>trolled</i> unto the <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> of the <i>meshigener carsey</i> which was in Jerusalem: and they <i>laued</i> forth Barnabas, that <i>she</i> should <i>troll</i> as far as Antioch.
    </li>
    <li>Who, when <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i>, and had <i>vardad</i> the <i>gracie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of <i>thumping cheat</i> they would cleave unto the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> was a <i>bona</i> <i>homie</i>, and full of the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i> and of faith: and <i>dowry</i> <i>homies and palones</i> was added unto the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>trolled off</i> Barnabas to Tarsus, for to <i>charper</i> Saul:
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> had found <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> brought <i>her</i> unto Antioch. <i>Any road up</i>, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the <i>meshigener carsey</i>, and taught <i>dowry</i> <i>homies and palones</i>. And the disciples were <i>screeched</i> Christians first in Antioch.
    </li>
    <li>And in these days <i>trolled</i> prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.
    </li>
    <li>And there stood up <i>una</i> of them named Agabus, and signified by the <i>Fairy</i> that there should be <i>dowry</i> dearth throughout all the world: which <i>trolled</i> to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.
    </li>
    <li>Then the disciples, every <i>homie</i> according to <i>her</i> ability, determined to <i>lau</i> relief unto the <i>sisters</i> which <i>letted</i> in Judaea:
    </li>
    <li>Which also they did, and <i>laued</i> it to the <i>fungi</i> by the <i>fambles</i> of Barnabas and Saul.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now about that time Herod the <i>dowriest homie</i> stretched forth <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i> to vex certain of the <i>meshigener carsey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>ferricadozad</i> James the <i>sister</i> of <i>Jane</i> with the <i>dowry efink</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And because <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> it pleased the <i>kosher homies</i>, <i>she</i> proceeded further to <i>lell</i> <i>Petra</i> also. (Then were the days of unleavened <i>pannan</i>. )
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> had apprehended <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> put <i>her</i> in <i>charpering carsey</i>, and <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> to <i>quarter</i> quaternions of <i>butch homies</i> to keep <i>her</i>; intending after Easter to <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> forth to the <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Petra</i> therefore was kept in <i>charpering carsey</i>: but <i>meshigener muttering</i> was made <i>nanti</i> ceasing of the <i>meshigener carsey</i> unto <i>Gloria</i> for <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when Herod would have brought <i>her</i> forth, the same <i>nochy</i> <i>Petra</i> was sleeping between <i>dewey</i> <i>butch homies</i>, bound with <i>dewey</i> chains: and the keepers before the door kept the <i>charpering carsey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> upon <i>her</i>, and a <i>sparkle</i> shined in the <i>charpering carsey</i>: and <i>she</i> <i>slapped</i> <i>Petra</i> on the side, and raised <i>her</i> up, <i>cackling</i>, Arise up quickly. And <i>her</i> chains fell off from <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>fairy</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so <i>she</i> did. And <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i> unto <i>her</i>, Cast thy <i>frock</i> about thee, and <i>troll after</i> me.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> out, and <i>trolled after</i> <i>her</i>; and wist not that it was true which was done by the <i>fairy</i>; but thought <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> a vision.
    </li>
    <li>When they were past the first and the second ward, they <i>trolled</i> unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the <i>smoke</i>; which opened to them of <i>her</i> own accord: and they <i>trolled</i> out, and passed on through <i>una</i> street; and forthwith the <i>fairy</i> <i>trolled off</i> from <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>Petra</i> was <i>troll</i> to himself, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Now I know of a surety, that the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> <i>fairy</i>, and hath <i>laued</i> me out of the <i>famble</i> of Herod, and from all the expectation of the <i>homies and palones</i> of the <i>kosher homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> had considered the <i>fakement</i>, <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> to the <i>lattie</i> of Mary the mother of <i>Jane</i>, whose surname was <i>Marcia</i>; where many were gathered together praying.
    </li>
    <li>And as <i>Petra</i> knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel <i>trolled</i> to <i>aunt nell</i>, named Rhoda.
    </li>
    <li>And when she knew <i>Petra</i>&#8216;s <i>cackling fakement</i>, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and <i>cackled</i> how <i>Petra</i> stood before the gate.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>cackled</i> unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then <i>cackled</i> they, It is <i>her</i> <i>fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>Petra</i> continued knocking: and when they had opened the door, and <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i>, they were <i>gobsmacked</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i>, beckoning unto them with the <i>famble</i> to hold their peace, <i>screeched</i> unto them how the <i>Duchess</i> had brought <i>her</i> out of the <i>charpering carsey</i>. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>troll</i> shew these <i>fakements</i> unto James, and to the <i>sisters</i>. And <i>she</i> <i>trolled off</i>, and <i>trolled</i> into another place.
    </li>
    <li>Now as soon as it was <i>journo</i>, there was no <i>pogey</i> stir among the <i>butch homies</i>, what was become of <i>Petra</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when Herod had sought for <i>her</i>, and found <i>her</i> not, <i>she</i> examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to <i>carking it</i>. And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there <i>letted</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they <i>trolled</i> with <i>una</i> accord to <i>her</i>, and, having made Blastus the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s chamberlain their <i>bencove</i>, <i>fancied</i> peace; because their country was nourished by the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s country.
    </li>
    <li>And upon a set <i>journo</i> Herod, arrayed in royal <i>schmutter</i>, sat upon <i>her</i> throne, and made an oration unto them.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>parkered</i> a <i>screech</i>, <i>cackling</i>, It is the <i>cackling fakement</i> of a <i>Gloria</i>, and not of a <i>homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And immediately the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>slapped</i> <i>her</i>, because <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> not <i>Gloria</i> the <i>fabeness</i>: and <i>she</i> was <i>jarried</i> of worms, and <i>parkered</i> up the <i>fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i> grew and multiplied.
    </li>
    <li>And Barnabas and Saul <i>trolled back</i> from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and <i>lelled</i> with them <i>Jane</i>, whose surname was <i>Marcia</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 13</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now there were in the <i>meshigener carsey</i> that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was <i>screeched</i> Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
    </li>
    <li>As they ministered to the <i>Duchess</i>, and fasted, the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i> <i>cackled</i>, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the <i>acting dickey</i> whereunto I have <i>screeched</i> them.
    </li>
    <li>And when they had fasted and prayed, and <i>laued</i> their <i>fambles</i> on them, they <i>laued</i> them away.
    </li>
    <li>So they, being <i>laued</i> forth by the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>, <i>trolled off</i> unto Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.
    </li>
    <li>And when they were at Salamis, they <i>cackled</i> the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i> in the synagogues of the <i>kosher homies</i>: and they had also <i>Jane</i> to their minister.
    </li>
    <li>And when they had <i>trolled</i> through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a <i>kosher homie</i>, whose name was Barjesus:
    </li>
    <li>Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent <i>homie</i>; who <i>screeched</i> for Barnabas and Saul, and <i>fancied</i> to <i>aunt nell</i> the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is <i>her</i> name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.
    </li>
    <li>Then Saul, (who also is <i>screeched</i> <i>Pauline</i>,) filled with the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>, set <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i> on <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackled</i>, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou <i>chavvie</i> of the devil, thou enemy of all <i>bonaness</i>, wilt thou not cease to pervert the <i>sweet</i> ways of the <i>Duchess</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And now, <i>varda</i>, the <i>famble</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> is upon thee, and thou shalt be <i>nanti varda</i>, not <i>vardaing</i> the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on <i>her</i> a mist and a <i>munge</i>; and <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> about seeking some to lead <i>her</i> by the <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then the deputy, when <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> what was done, believed, being <i>gobsmacked</i> at the doctrine of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now when <i>Pauline</i> and <i>her</i> company loosed from Paphos, they <i>trolled</i> to Perga in Pamphylia: and <i>Jane</i> departing from them <i>trolled back to</i> Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>But when they <i>trolled off</i> from Perga, they <i>trolled</i> to Antioch in Pisidia, and <i>trolled</i> into the synagogue on the sabbath <i>journo</i>, and sat down.
    </li>
    <li>And after the <i>vardaing the lavs</i> of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue <i>laued</i> unto them, <i>cackling</i>, Ye <i>homies</i> and <i>sisters</i>, if ye have any <i>lav</i> of exhortation for the <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>cackle</i> on.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>Pauline</i> stood up, and beckoning with <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>homies</i> of Israel, and ye that fear <i>Gloria</i>, <i>parker</i> audience.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Gloria</i> of this <i>homies and palones</i> of Israel chose our <i>aunties</i>, and exalted the <i>homies and palones</i> when they <i>letted</i> as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought <i>she</i> them out of it.
    </li>
    <li>And about the time of <i>quarter dacha</i> years suffered <i>she</i> their manners in the <i>nishta smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> had <i>battyfanged</i> <i>setter</i> nations in the land of Chanaan, <i>she</i> <i>medzered</i> their land to them by lot.
    </li>
    <li>And after that <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> unto them <i>beaks</i> about the space of <i>quarter</i> <i>chenter</i> and <i>chinker dacha</i> years, until Samuel the prophet.
    </li>
    <li>And afterward they <i>fancied</i> a <i>dowriest homie</i>: and <i>Gloria</i> <i>parkered</i> unto them Saul the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Cis, a <i>homie</i> of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of <i>quarter dacha</i> years.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> had removed <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> raised up unto them <i>Davina</i> to be their <i>dowriest homie</i>; to whom also <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> their testimony, and <i>cackled</i>, I have found <i>Davina</i> the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jesse, a <i>homie</i> after mine own <i>thumping cheat</i>, which shall fulfil all my will.
    </li>
    <li>Of this <i>homie</i>&#8216;s <i>maria</i> hath <i>Gloria</i> according to <i>her</i> promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, <i>Josie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>When <i>Jane</i> had first <i>cackled</i> before <i>her</i> <i>trolling</i> the baptism of repentance to all the <i>homies and palones</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And as <i>Jane</i> fulfilled <i>her</i> course, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Whom think ye that I am? I am not <i>she</i>. But, <i>varda</i>, there <i>trolleth</i> <i>una</i> after me, whose <i>slingbacks</i> of <i>her</i> <i>plates</i> I am not <i>bona</i> to loose.
    </li>
    <li><i>Homies</i> and <i>sisters</i>, <i>chavvies</i> of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth <i>Gloria</i>, to you is the <i>lav</i> of this salvation <i>laued</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For they that <i>lett</i> at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew <i>her</i> not, <i>nishta</i> yet the voices of the prophets which are <i>varda the lavs</i> every sabbath <i>journo</i>, they have fulfilled them in condemning <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And though they found no cause of <i>carking it</i> in <i>her</i>, yet <i>fancied</i> they Pilate that <i>she</i> should be <i>ferricadoozed</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when they had fulfilled all that was <i>screeved</i> of <i>her</i>, they <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> down from the tree, and <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> in a sepulchre.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>Gloria</i> raised <i>her</i> from the <i>stiff</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> was <i>vardad</i> many days of them which <i>trolled</i> up with <i>her</i> from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are <i>her</i> witnesses unto the <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And we <i>screech</i> unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the <i>aunties</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Gloria</i> hath fulfilled the same unto us their <i>chavvies</i>, in that <i>she</i> hath raised up <i>Josie</i> again; as it is also <i>screeved</i> in the second psalm, Thou art my <i>homie chavvie</i>, this <i>journo</i> have I begotten thee.
    </li>
    <li>And as concerning that <i>she</i> raised <i>her</i> up from the <i>stiff</i>, now <i>nishta</i> to <i>troll back to</i> corruption, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> on this wise, I will <i>parker</i> you the sure mercies of <i>Davina</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i> also in another psalm, <i>nishta</i> suffer thine <i>fabulosa</i> <i>una</i> to <i>varda</i> corruption.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>Davina</i>, after <i>she</i> had served <i>her</i> own generation by the will of <i>Gloria</i>, fell on <i>letty</i>, and was <i>laued</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>, and <i>vardad</i> corruption:
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i>, whom <i>Gloria</i> raised again, <i>vardad</i> no corruption.
    </li>
    <li>Be it known unto you therefore, <i>homies</i> and <i>sisters</i>, that through this <i>homie</i> is <i>cackled</i> unto you the forgiveness of <i>kertervers</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And by <i>her</i> all that believe are justified from all <i>fakements</i>, from which ye could not be justified by the law of <i>Maureen</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Gardy loo</i> therefore, lest that <i>troll</i> upon you, which is <i>cackled</i> of in the prophets;
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I <i>acting dickey</i> a <i>acting dickey</i> in your days, a <i>acting dickey</i> which ye shall in no wise believe, though a <i>homie</i> <i>screech</i> it unto you.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>kosher homies</i> were <i>trolled</i> out of the synagogue, the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> besought that these <i>lavs</i> might be <i>cackled</i> to them the next sabbath.
    </li>
    <li>Now when the <i>punters</i> was broken up, many of the <i>kosher homies</i> and religious proselytes <i>trolled after</i> <i>Pauline</i> and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the <i>gracie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the next sabbath <i>journo</i> <i>trolled</i> almost the whole <i>smoke</i> together to <i>aunt nell</i> the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But when the <i>kosher homies</i> <i>vardad</i> the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and <i>cackled</i> against those <i>fakements</i> which were <i>cackled</i> by <i>Pauline</i>, contradicting and blaspheming.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>Pauline</i> and Barnabas waxed bold, and <i>cackled</i>, It was necessary that the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i> should first have been <i>cackled</i> to you: but <i>vardaing</i> ye put it from you, and <i>beak</i> yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For so hath the <i>Duchess</i> commanded us, <i>cackling</i>, I have set thee to be a <i>sparkle</i> of the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> this, they were glad, and glorified the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> was published throughout all the region.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>kosher homies</i> stirred up the devout and honourable <i>palones</i>, and the <i>dowriest</i> <i>homies</i> of the <i>smoke</i>, and raised <i>chivvying</i> against <i>Pauline</i> and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.
    </li>
    <li>But they shook off the dust of their <i>plates</i> against them, and <i>trolled</i> unto Iconium.
    </li>
    <li>And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>.

    <h2>Chapter 14</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> in Iconium, that they <i>trolled</i> both together into the synagogue of the <i>kosher homies</i>, and so <i>cackled</i>, that a <i>dowry</i> multitude both of the <i>kosher homies</i> and also of the Greeks believed.
    </li>
    <li>But the unbelieving <i>kosher homies</i> stirred up the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>, and made their minds <i>nana</i> affected against the <i>sisters</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Long time therefore <i>letted</i> they speaking boldly in the <i>Duchess</i>, which <i>parkered</i> testimony unto the <i>lav</i> of <i>her</i> <i>gracie</i>, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their <i>fambles</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But the multitude of the <i>smoke</i> was <i>medzered</i>: and part held with the <i>kosher homies</i>, and part with the apostles.
    </li>
    <li>And when there was an assault made both of the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>, and also of the <i>kosher homies</i> with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them,
    </li>
    <li>They were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, <i>smokes</i> of Lycaonia, and unto the region that <i>lettieth</i> round about:
    </li>
    <li>And there they <i>cackled</i> the <i>gossip</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And there sat a certain <i>homie</i> at Lystra, impotent in <i>her</i> <i>plates</i>, being a cripple from <i>her</i> mother&#8217;s womb, who never had <i>minced</i>:
    </li>
    <li>The same <i>aunt nelled</i> <i>Pauline</i> <i>cackle</i>: who stedfastly beholding <i>her</i>, and perceiving that <i>she</i> had faith to be healed,
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackled</i> with a loud <i>cackling fakement</i>, Stand upright on thy <i>plates</i>. And <i>she</i> leaped and <i>minced</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>vardad</i> what <i>Pauline</i> had done, they lifted up their voices, <i>cackling</i> in the <i>cackle</i> of Lycaonia, The gods are <i>troll</i> down to us in the likeness of <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>screeched</i> Barnabas, Jupiter; and <i>Pauline</i>, Mercurius, because <i>she</i> was the <i>dowriest</i> speaker.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>godly homie</i> of Jupiter, which was before their <i>smoke</i>, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done <i>parker</i> with the <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Which when the apostles, Barnabas and <i>Pauline</i>, <i>aunt nelled</i> of, they rent their <i>zhoosh</i>, and ran in among the <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>screeching</i> out,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackling</i>, Sirs, why do ye these <i>fakements</i>? We also are <i>homies</i> of like passions with you, and <i>cackle</i> unto you that ye should turn from these <i>spanglies</i> unto the living <i>Gloria</i>, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all <i>fakements</i> that are therein:
    </li>
    <li>Who in times past suffered all nations to <i>mince</i> in their own ways.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> <i>she</i> <i>dry</i> not himself <i>nanti</i> <i>varda-ing fakement</i>, in that <i>she</i> did <i>bona</i>, and <i>parkered</i> us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our <i>thumping cheats</i> with <i>manjarry</i> and gladness.
    </li>
    <li>And with these sayings scarce restrained they the <i>homies and palones</i>, that they had not done <i>parker</i> unto them.
    </li>
    <li>And there <i>trolled</i> thither certain <i>kosher homies</i> from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the <i>homies and palones</i>, and having stoned <i>Pauline</i>, drew <i>her</i> out of the <i>smoke</i>, supposing <i>she</i> had been <i>stiff</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> rose up, and <i>trolled</i> into the <i>smoke</i>: and the next <i>journo</i> <i>she</i> <i>trolled off</i> with Barnabas to Derbe.
    </li>
    <li>And when they had <i>cackled</i> the <i>gossip</i> to that <i>smoke</i>, and had taught many, they <i>trolled back</i> again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch,
    </li>
    <li>Confirming the <i>nishta lucoddies</i> of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through <i>dowry</i> tribulation enter into the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when they had ordained them <i>fungi</i> in every <i>meshigener carsey</i>, and had prayed with <i>nistha manjarrying</i>, they commended them to the <i>Duchess</i>, on whom they believed.
    </li>
    <li>And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they <i>trolled</i> to Pamphylia.
    </li>
    <li>And when they had <i>cackled</i> the <i>lav</i> in Perga, they <i>trolled</i> down into Attalia:
    </li>
    <li>And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended to the <i>gracie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> for the <i>acting dickey</i> which they fulfilled.
    </li>
    <li>And when they were <i>troll</i>, and had gathered the <i>meshigener carsey</i> together, they rehearsed all that <i>Gloria</i> had done with them, and how <i>she</i> had opened the door of faith unto the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And there they <i>letted</i> long time with the disciples.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 15</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And certain <i>homies</i> which <i>trolled</i> down from Judaea taught the <i>sisters</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Except ye be <i>roundhead</i> after the manner of <i>Maureen</i>, ye cannot be saved.
    </li>
    <li>When therefore <i>Pauline</i> and Barnabas had no <i>pogey</i> dissension and disputation with them, they determined that <i>Pauline</i> and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should <i>troll</i> up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and <i>fungi</i> about this question.
    </li>
    <li>And being brought on their way by the <i>meshigener carsey</i>, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>: and they caused <i>dowry</i> joy unto all the <i>sisters</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when they were <i>troll</i> to Jerusalem, they were <i>lalled</i> of the <i>meshigener carsey</i>, and of the apostles and <i>fungi</i>, and they <i>screeched</i> all <i>fakements</i> that <i>Gloria</i> had done with them.
    </li>
    <li>But there rose up certain of the sect of the <i>lily laws</i> which believed, <i>cackling</i>, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of <i>Maureen</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the apostles and <i>fungi</i> <i>trolled</i> together for to consider of this matter.
    </li>
    <li>And when there had been <i>dowry</i> disputing, <i>Petra</i> rose up, and <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>homies</i> and <i>sisters</i>, ye know how that a <i>bona</i> while ago <i>Gloria</i> made choice among us, that the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> by my <i>screech</i> should <i>aunt nell</i> the <i>lav</i> of the <i>gossip</i>, and believe.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Gloria</i>, which knoweth the <i>thumping cheats</i>, bare them <i>varda-ing fakement</i>, giving them the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>, even as <i>she</i> did unto us;
    </li>
    <li>And put no difference between us and them, purifying their <i>thumping cheats</i> by faith.
    </li>
    <li>Now therefore why tempt ye <i>Gloria</i>, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which <i>nishta</i> our <i>aunties</i> <i>nishta</i> we were able to bear?
    </li>
    <li>But we believe that through the <i>gracie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> we shall be saved, even as they.
    </li>
    <li>Then all the multitude kept <i>nishta cackle</i>, and <i>parkered</i> audience to Barnabas and <i>Pauline</i>, declaring what miracles and wonders <i>Gloria</i> had wrought among the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> by them.
    </li>
    <li>And after they had held their peace, James answered, <i>cackling</i>, <i>homies</i> and <i>sisters</i>, <i>aunt nell</i> unto me:
    </li>
    <li>Simeon hath <i>screeched</i> how <i>Gloria</i> at the first did visit the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>, to <i>lell</i> out of them a <i>homies and palones</i> for <i>her</i> name.
    </li>
    <li>And to this agree the <i>lavs</i> of the prophets; as it is <i>screeved</i>,
    </li>
    <li>After this I will return, and will build again the <i>bijou tabernaclette</i> of <i>Davina</i>, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:
    </li>
    <li>That the residue of <i>homies</i> might <i>charper</i> after the <i>Duchess</i>, and all the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>, upon whom my name is <i>screeched</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, who doeth all these <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Known unto <i>Gloria</i> are all <i>her</i> works from the beginning of the world.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> are turned to <i>Gloria</i>:
    </li>
    <li>But that we <i>screeve</i> unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from <i>charvering</i>, and from <i>fakements</i> strangled, and from blood.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>Maureen</i> of <i>badge</i> time hath in every <i>smoke</i> them that <i>cackle</i> <i>her</i>, being <i>varda the lavs</i> in the synagogues every sabbath <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then pleased it the apostles and <i>fungi</i> with the whole <i>meshigener carsey</i>, to <i>lau</i> chosen <i>homies</i> of their own company to Antioch with <i>Pauline</i> and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, <i>dowriest</i> <i>homies</i> among the <i>sisters</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>screeved</i> letters by them after this manner; The apostles and <i>fungi</i> and <i>sisters</i> <i>lau</i> greeting unto the <i>sisters</i> which are of the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.
    </li>
    <li>Forasmuch as we have <i>aunt nelled</i>, that certain which <i>trolled</i> out from us have troubled you with <i>lavs</i>, subverting your <i>nishta lucoddies</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Ye must be <i>roundhead</i>, and keep the law: to whom we <i>parkered</i> no such <i>butch lav</i>:
    </li>
    <li>It seemed <i>bona</i> unto us, being assembled with <i>una</i> accord, to <i>lau</i> chosen <i>homies</i> unto you with our beloved Barnabas and <i>Pauline</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Homies</i> that have hazarded their lives for the name of our <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>We have <i>laued</i> therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also <i>cackle</i> you the same <i>fakements</i> by <i>screech</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For it seemed <i>bona</i> to the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>, and to us, to <i>lett</i> upon you no <i>dowrier</i> burden than these necessary <i>fakements</i>;
    </li>
    <li>That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from <i>fakements</i> strangled, and from <i>charvering</i>: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.
    </li>
    <li>So when they were dismissed, they <i>trolled</i> to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they <i>laued</i> the epistle:
    </li>
    <li>Which when they had <i>varda the lavs</i>, they rejoiced for the consolation.
    </li>
    <li>And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the <i>sisters</i> with many <i>lavs</i>, and confirmed them.
    </li>
    <li>And after they had tarried there a space, they were let <i>sling yer hook</i> from the <i>sisters</i> unto the apostles.
    </li>
    <li>Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to <i>lett</i> there still.
    </li>
    <li><i>Pauline</i> also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and <i>cackling</i> the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, with many others also.
    </li>
    <li>And some days after <i>Pauline</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Barnabas, Let us <i>troll</i> again and visit our <i>sisters</i> in every <i>smoke</i> where we have <i>cackled</i> the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>varda</i> how they do.
    </li>
    <li>And Barnabas determined to <i>lell</i> with them <i>Jane</i>, whose surname was <i>Marcia</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>Pauline</i> thought not <i>bona</i> to <i>lell</i> <i>her</i> with them, who <i>trolled off</i> from them from Pamphylia, and <i>trolled</i> not with them to the <i>acting dickey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the contention was so sharp between them, that they <i>trolled off</i> asunder <i>una</i> from the other: and so Barnabas <i>lelled</i> <i>Marcia</i>, and sailed unto Cyprus;
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Pauline</i> chose Silas, and <i>trolled off</i>, being recommended by the <i>sisters</i> unto the <i>gracie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the <i>meshigener carseys</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 16</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Then <i>trolled</i> <i>she</i> to Derbe and Lystra: and, <i>varda</i>, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of a certain <i>palone</i>, which was a Jewess, and believed; but <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> was a Greek:
    </li>
    <li>Which was well reported of by the <i>sisters</i> that were at Lystra and Iconium.
    </li>
    <li><i>Her</i> would <i>Pauline</i> have to <i>troll forth</i> with <i>her</i>; and <i>lelled</i> and <i>roundhead</i> <i>her</i> because of the <i>kosher homies</i> which were in those quarters: for they knew all that <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> was a Greek.
    </li>
    <li>And as they <i>trolled</i> through the <i>smokes</i>, they <i>laued</i> them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and <i>fungi</i> which were at Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And so were the <i>meshigener carseys</i> established in the faith, and increased in number daily.
    </li>
    <li>Now when they had <i>trolled</i> throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i> to <i>cackle</i> the <i>lav</i> in Asia,
    </li>
    <li>After they were <i>troll</i> to Mysia, they assayed to <i>troll</i> into Bithynia: but the <i>Fairy</i> suffered them not.
    </li>
    <li>And they passing by Mysia <i>trolled</i> down to Troas.
    </li>
    <li>And a vision appeared to <i>Pauline</i> in the <i>nochy</i>; There stood a <i>homie</i> of Macedonia, and prayed <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>troll</i> over into Macedonia, and help us.
    </li>
    <li>And after <i>she</i> had <i>vardad</i> the vision, immediately we endeavoured to <i>troll</i> into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the <i>Duchess</i> had <i>screeched</i> us for to <i>cackle</i> the <i>gossip</i> unto them.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore loosing from Troas, we <i>trolled</i> with a <i>hettie</i> course to Samothracia, and the next <i>journo</i> to Neapolis;
    </li>
    <li>And from thence to Philippi, which is the <i>dowriest</i> <i>smoke</i> of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that <i>smoke</i> <i>letting</i> certain days.
    </li>
    <li>And on the sabbath we <i>trolled</i> out of the <i>smoke</i> by a river side, where <i>meshigener muttering</i> was wont to be made; and we sat down, and <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>palones</i> which resorted thither.
    </li>
    <li>And a certain <i>palone</i> named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the <i>smoke</i> of Thyatira, which worshipped <i>Gloria</i>, <i>aunt nelled</i> us: whose <i>thumping cheat</i> the <i>Duchess</i> opened, that she attended unto the <i>fakements</i> which were <i>cackled</i> of <i>Pauline</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, <i>cackling</i>, If ye have judged me to be <i>fabulous</i> to the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>troll</i> into my <i>lattie</i>, and <i>lett</i> there. And she constrained us.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, as we <i>trolled</i> to <i>meshigener muttering</i>, a certain damsel possessed with a <i>Fairy</i> of divination met us, which brought her masters <i>dowry</i> gain by soothsaying:
    </li>
    <li>The same <i>trolled after</i> <i>Pauline</i> and us, and <i>screeched</i>, <i>cackling</i>, These <i>homies</i> are the <i>serving homies</i> of the most high <i>Gloria</i>, which shew unto us the way of salvation.
    </li>
    <li>And this did she many days. But <i>Pauline</i>, being grieved, turned and <i>cackled</i> to the <i>Fairy</i>, I command thee in the name of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> to <i>troll</i> out of her. And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> out the same hour.
    </li>
    <li>And when her masters <i>vardad</i> that the hope of their gains was <i>trolled</i>, they caught <i>Pauline</i> and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers,
    </li>
    <li>And brought them to the <i>beaks</i>, <i>cackling</i>, These <i>homies</i>, being <i>kosher homies</i>, do exceedingly trouble our <i>smoke</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to <i>lall</i>, <i>nishta</i> to observe, being Romans.
    </li>
    <li>And the multitude rose up together against them: and the <i>beaks</i> rent off their <i>zhoosh</i>, and commanded to <i>zsa zsa-ed</i> them.
    </li>
    <li>And when they had <i>laued</i> many stripes upon them, they cast them into <i>charpering carsey</i>, charging the jailor to keep them safely:
    </li>
    <li>Who, having <i>lalled</i> such a charge, thrust them into the inner <i>charpering carsey</i>, and made their <i>plates</i> <i>nishta manjarry</i> in the stocks.
    </li>
    <li>And at midnight <i>Pauline</i> and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto <i>Gloria</i>: and the prisoners <i>aunt nelled</i> them.
    </li>
    <li>And suddenly there was a <i>dowry</i> earthquake, so that the foundations of the <i>charpering carsey</i> were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every <i>una</i>&#8216;s bands were loosed.
    </li>
    <li>And the keeper of the <i>charpering carsey</i> awaking out of <i>her</i> <i>letty</i>, and <i>vardaing</i> the <i>charpering carsey</i> doors open, <i>she</i> drew out <i>her</i> <i>dowry efink</i>, and would have <i>ferricadozad</i> himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>Pauline</i> <i>screeched</i> with a loud <i>cackling fakement</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> for a <i>sparkle</i>, and sprang in, and <i>trolled</i> trembling, and fell down before <i>Pauline</i> and Silas,
    </li>
    <li>And brought them out, and <i>cackled</i>, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>cackled</i>, Believe on the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, and thou shalt be saved, and thy <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and to all that were in <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> them the same hour of the <i>nochy</i>, and <i>dhobied</i> their stripes; and was baptized, <i>she</i> and all <i>her</i>, straightway.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> had brought them into <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>, <i>she</i> set <i>carnish</i> before them, and rejoiced, believing in <i>Gloria</i> with all <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when it was <i>journo</i>, the <i>beaks</i> <i>laued</i> the serjeants, <i>cackling</i>, Let those <i>homies</i> <i>troll</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the keeper of the <i>charpering carsey</i> <i>cackled</i> this <i>cackling</i> to <i>Pauline</i>, The <i>beaks</i> have <i>laued</i> to let you <i>troll</i>: now therefore <i>troll off</i>, and <i>sling yer hook</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>Pauline</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into <i>charpering carsey</i>; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them <i>troll</i> themselves and fetch us out.
    </li>
    <li>And the serjeants <i>cackled</i> these <i>lavs</i> unto the <i>beaks</i>: and they feared, when they <i>aunt nelled</i> that they were Romans.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>trolled</i> and besought them, and brought them out, and <i>fancied</i> them to <i>troll off</i> out of the <i>smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>trolled</i> out of the <i>charpering carsey</i>, and entered into the <i>lattie</i> of Lydia: and when they had <i>vardad</i> the <i>sisters</i>, they comforted them, and <i>trolled off</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 17</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they <i>trolled</i> to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the <i>kosher homies</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Pauline</i>, as <i>her</i> manner was, <i>trolled</i> in unto them, and <i>trey</i> sabbath days reasoned with them out of the <i>glossies</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Opening and alleging, that <i>Crystal</i> must needs have suffered, and risen again from the <i>stiff</i>; and that this <i>Josie</i>, whom I <i>cackle</i> unto you, is <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And some of them believed, and consorted with <i>Pauline</i> and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a <i>dowry</i> multitude, and of the <i>dowriest</i> <i>palones</i> not a <i>nishta dowry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>kosher homies</i> which believed not, <i>trolled</i> with envy, <i>lelled</i> unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the <i>smoke</i> on an uproar, and assaulted the <i>lattie</i> of Jason, and sought to <i>parker</i> them out to the <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain <i>sisters</i> unto the rulers of the <i>smoke</i>, <i>screeching</i>, These that have turned the world upside down are <i>troll</i> hither also;
    </li>
    <li>Whom Jason hath <i>lalled</i>: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, <i>cackling</i> that there is another <i>dowriest homie</i>, <i>una</i> <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they troubled the <i>homies and palones</i> and the rulers of the <i>smoke</i>, when they <i>aunt nelled</i> these <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when they had <i>lelled</i> security of Jason, and of the other, they let them <i>troll</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>sisters</i> immediately <i>laued</i> away <i>Pauline</i> and Silas by <i>nochy</i> unto Berea: who <i>trolling</i> thither <i>trolled</i> into the synagogue of the <i>kosher homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they <i>lalled</i> the <i>lav</i> with all readiness of mind, and searched the <i>glossies</i> daily, whether those <i>fakements</i> were so.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable <i>palones</i> which were Greeks, and of <i>homies</i>, not a <i>nishta dowry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But when the <i>kosher homies</i> of Thessalonica had knowledge that the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i> was <i>cackled</i> of <i>Pauline</i> at Berea, they <i>trolled</i> thither also, and stirred up the <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And then immediately the <i>sisters</i> <i>laued</i> away <i>Pauline</i> to <i>troll</i> as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus <i>letted</i> there still.
    </li>
    <li>And they that conducted <i>Pauline</i> brought <i>her</i> unto Athens: and receiving a <i>butch lav</i> unto Silas and Timotheus for to <i>troll</i> to <i>her</i> with all speed, they <i>trolled off</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now while <i>Pauline</i> waited for them at Athens, <i>her</i> <i>Fairy</i> was stirred in <i>her</i>, when <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> the <i>smoke</i> wholly <i>parkered</i> to idolatry.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore disputed <i>she</i> in the synagogue with the <i>kosher homies</i>, and with the devout persons, and in the <i>bodega</i> daily with them that met with <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered <i>her</i>. And some <i>cackled</i>, What will this babbler <i>cackle</i>? other some, <i>she</i> seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them <i>Josie</i>, and the resurrection.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i>, and brought <i>her</i> unto Areopagus, <i>cackling</i>, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou <i>cacklest</i>, is?
    </li>
    <li>For thou bringest certain strange <i>fakements</i> to our <i>aunt nelly cheats</i>: we would know therefore what these <i>fakements</i> mean.
    </li>
    <li>(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in <i>nishter</i> else, but either to <i>cackle</i>, or to <i>aunt nell</i> some new <i>fakement</i>. )
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>Pauline</i> stood in the midst of Mars&#8217; hill, and <i>cackled</i>, Ye <i>homies</i> of Athens, I perceive that in all <i>fakements</i> ye are too superstitious.
    </li>
    <li>For as I <i>trolled by</i>, and beheld your devotions, I found an <i>grovelling fakement</i> with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN <i>Gloria</i>. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, <i>her</i> <i>screech</i> I unto you.
    </li>
    <li><i>Gloria</i> that made the world and all <i>fakements</i> therein, <i>vardaing</i> that <i>she</i> is <i>Duchess</i> of heaven and earth, <i>letteth</i> not in temples made with <i>fambles</i>;
    </li>
    <li><i>Nishta</i> is worshipped with <i>homies</i>&#8216;s <i>fambles</i>, as though <i>she</i> needed any <i>fakement</i>, <i>vardaing</i> <i>she</i> giveth to all life, and breath, and all <i>fakements</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And hath made of <i>una</i> blood all nations of <i>homies</i> for to <i>lett</i> on all the <i>eke</i> of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;
    </li>
    <li>That they should <i>charper</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, if haply they might feel after <i>her</i>, and find <i>her</i>, though <i>she</i> be not <i>nishter ajax</i> every <i>una</i> of us:
    </li>
    <li>For in <i>her</i> we live, and <i>troll</i>, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have <i>cackled</i>, For we are also <i>her</i> offspring.
    </li>
    <li>Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of <i>Gloria</i>, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto <i>gelt</i>, or silver, or stone, graven by art and <i>homie</i>&#8216;s device.
    </li>
    <li>And the times of this ignorance <i>Gloria</i> winked at; but now commandeth all <i>homies</i> every where to repent:
    </li>
    <li>Because <i>she</i> hath appointed a <i>journo</i>, in the which <i>she</i> will <i>beak</i> the world in <i>bonaness</i> by that <i>homie</i> whom <i>she</i> hath ordained; whereof <i>she</i> hath <i>parkered</i> assurance unto all <i>homies</i>, in that <i>she</i> hath raised <i>her</i> from the <i>stiff</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when they <i>aunt nelled</i> of the resurrection of the <i>stiff</i>, some mocked: and others <i>cackled</i>, We will <i>aunt nell</i> thee again of this matter.
    </li>
    <li>So <i>Pauline</i> <i>trolled off</i> from among them.
    </li>
    <li>Howbeit certain <i>homies</i> clave unto <i>her</i>, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a <i>palone</i> named Damaris, and others with them.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 18</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>After these <i>fakements</i> <i>Pauline</i> <i>trolled off</i> from Athens, and <i>trolled</i> to Corinth;
    </li>
    <li>And found a certain <i>kosher homie</i> named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately <i>troll</i> from Italy, with <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i> Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all <i>kosher homies</i> to <i>troll off</i> from Rome:) and <i>trolled</i> unto them.
    </li>
    <li>And because <i>she</i> was of the same craft, <i>she</i> <i>letted</i> with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the <i>kosher homies</i> and the Greeks.
    </li>
    <li>And when Silas and Timotheus were <i>troll</i> from Macedonia, <i>Pauline</i> was pressed in the <i>Fairy</i>, and testified to the <i>kosher homies</i> that <i>Josie</i> was <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, <i>she</i> shook <i>her</i> <i>clobber</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto them, Your blood be upon your own <i>ekes</i>; I am clean; from henceforth I will <i>troll</i> unto the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled off</i> thence, and entered into a certain <i>homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, named Justus, <i>una</i> that worshipped <i>Gloria</i>, whose <i>lattie</i> joined hard to the synagogue.
    </li>
    <li>And Crispus, the <i>dowriest</i> ruler of the synagogue, believed on the <i>Duchess</i> with all <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> the <i>Duchess</i> to <i>Pauline</i> in the <i>nochy</i> by a vision, Be not afraid, but <i>cackle</i>, and hold not thy peace:
    </li>
    <li>For I am with thee, and no <i>homie</i> shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have <i>dowry</i> <i>homies and palones</i> in this <i>smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> continued there a year and <i>sey</i> months, teaching the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i> among them.
    </li>
    <li>And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the <i>kosher homies</i> made insurrection with <i>una</i> accord against <i>Pauline</i>, and brought <i>her</i> to the judgment seat,
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackling</i>, This fellow persuadeth <i>homies</i> to worship <i>Gloria</i> contrary to the law.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>Pauline</i> was now about to open <i>her</i> <i>screech</i>, Gallio <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>kosher homies</i>, If it were a matter of wrong or <i>naff</i> lewdness, O ye <i>kosher homies</i>, reason would that I should bear with you:
    </li>
    <li>But if it be a question of <i>lavs</i> and names, and of your law, <i>varda</i> ye to it; for I will be no <i>beak</i> of such matters.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> drave them from the judgment seat.
    </li>
    <li>Then all the Greeks <i>lelled</i> Sosthenes, the <i>dowriest</i> ruler of the synagogue, and <i>zsa zsa-ed</i> <i>her</i> before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Pauline</i> after this tarried there yet a <i>bona</i> while, and then <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> leave of the <i>sisters</i>, and sailed thence into Syria, and with <i>her</i> Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> in Cenchrea: for <i>she</i> had a vow.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> to Ephesus, and <i>dry</i> them there: but <i>she</i> himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the <i>kosher homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>When they <i>fancied</i> <i>her</i> to tarry longer time with them, <i>she</i> consented not;
    </li>
    <li>But bade them farewell, <i>cackling</i>, I must by all means keep this <i>dowry munjarlee</i> that <i>trolleth</i> in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if <i>Gloria</i> will. And <i>she</i> sailed from Ephesus.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> had landed at Caesarea, and <i>trolled</i> up, and saluted the <i>meshigener carsey</i>, <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> down to Antioch.
    </li>
    <li>And after <i>she</i> had spent some time there, <i>she</i> <i>trolled off</i>, and <i>trolled</i> over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.
    </li>
    <li>And a certain <i>kosher homie</i> named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent <i>homie</i>, and <i>dowry butch</i> in the <i>glossies</i>, <i>trolled</i> to Ephesus.
    </li>
    <li>This <i>homie</i> was instructed in the way of the <i>Duchess</i>; and being fervent in the <i>Fairy</i>, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> and taught diligently the <i>fakements</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, knowing only the baptism of <i>Jane</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> began to <i>cackle</i> boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had <i>aunt nelled</i>, they <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> unto them, and expounded unto <i>her</i> the way of <i>Gloria</i> more perfectly.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> was disposed to pass into Achaia, the <i>sisters</i> <i>screeved</i>, exhorting the disciples to <i>lall</i> <i>her</i>: who, when <i>she</i> was <i>troll</i>, helped them <i>dowry</i> which had believed through <i>gracie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> mightily convinced the <i>kosher homies</i>, and that publickly, shewing by the <i>glossies</i> that <i>Josie</i> was <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 19</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, <i>Pauline</i> having passed through the upper coasts <i>trolled</i> to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Have ye <i>lalled</i> the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i> since ye believed? And they <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, We have not so <i>dowry</i> as <i>aunt nelled</i> whether there be any <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they <i>cackled</i>, Unto <i>Jane</i>&#8216;s baptism.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> <i>Pauline</i>, <i>Jane</i> verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, <i>cackling</i> unto the <i>homies and palones</i>, that they should believe on <i>her</i> which should <i>troll</i> after <i>her</i>, that is, on <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>When they <i>aunt nelled</i> this, they were baptized in the name of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>Pauline</i> had <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i> upon them, the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i> <i>trolled</i> on them; and they <i>cackled</i> with <i>polaris</i>, and prophesied.
    </li>
    <li>And all the <i>homies</i> were about <i>kenza</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> into the synagogue, and <i>cackled</i> boldly for the space of <i>trey</i> months, disputing and persuading the <i>fakements</i> concerning the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but <i>cackled</i> <i>nana</i> of that way before the multitude, <i>she</i> <i>trolled off</i> from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of <i>una</i> Tyrannus.
    </li>
    <li>And this continued by the space of <i>dewey</i> years; so that all they which <i>letted</i> in Asia <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i>, both <i>kosher homies</i> and Greeks.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Gloria</i> wrought special miracles by the <i>fambles</i> of <i>Pauline</i>:
    </li>
    <li>So that from <i>her</i> <i>lucoddy</i> were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or <i>frocks</i>, and the diseases <i>trolled off</i> from them, and the <i>nana</i> <i>fairies</i> <i>trolled</i> out of them.
    </li>
    <li>Then certain of the vagabond <i>kosher homies</i>, exorcists, <i>lelled</i> upon them to <i>screech</i> over them which had <i>nana</i> <i>fairies</i> the name of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i>, <i>cackling</i>, We adjure you by <i>Josie</i> whom <i>Pauline</i> preacheth.
    </li>
    <li>And there were <i>setter</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> of <i>una</i> Sceva, a <i>kosher homie</i>, and <i>dowriest</i> of the <i>godly homies</i>, which did so.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>nana</i> <i>Fairy</i> answered and <i>cackled</i>, <i>Josie</i> I know, and <i>Pauline</i> I know; but who are ye?
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>homie</i> in whom the <i>nana</i> <i>Fairy</i> was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that <i>lattie</i> <i>nanti zhoosh</i> and wounded.
    </li>
    <li>And this was known to all the <i>kosher homies</i> and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> was magnified.
    </li>
    <li>And many that believed <i>trolled</i>, and confessed, and shewed their deeds.
    </li>
    <li>Many of them also which used curious arts brought their <i>glossies</i> together, and burned them before all <i>homies</i>: and they counted the price of them, and found it <i>chinker dacha</i> <i>mille</i> pieces of silver.
    </li>
    <li>So mightily grew the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i> and prevailed.
    </li>
    <li>After these <i>fakements</i> were ended, <i>Pauline</i> purposed in the <i>Fairy</i>, when <i>she</i> had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to <i>troll</i> to Jerusalem, <i>cackling</i>, After I have been there, I must also <i>varda</i> Rome.
    </li>
    <li>So <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> into Macedonia <i>dewey</i> of them that ministered unto <i>her</i>, Timotheus and Erastus; but <i>she</i> himself stayed in Asia for a season.
    </li>
    <li>And the same time there arose no <i>pogey</i> stir about that way.
    </li>
    <li>For a certain <i>homie</i> named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no <i>pogey</i> gain unto the craftsmen;
    </li>
    <li>Whom <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> together with the workmen of like occupation, and <i>cackled</i>, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our <i>metties</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover ye <i>varda</i> and <i>aunt nell</i>, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this <i>Pauline</i> hath persuaded and turned away <i>dowry</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>cackling</i> that they be no gods, which are made with <i>fambles</i>:
    </li>
    <li>So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the <i>holy carsey</i> of the <i>dowry</i> goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be <i>battyfanged</i>, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.
    </li>
    <li>And when they <i>aunt nelled</i> these sayings, they were full of wrath, and <i>screeched</i> out, <i>cackling</i>, <i>dowry</i> is Diana of the Ephesians.
    </li>
    <li>And the whole <i>smoke</i> was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, <i>homies</i> of Macedonia, <i>Pauline</i>&#8216;s companions in travel, they rushed with <i>una</i> accord into the theatre.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>Pauline</i> would have entered in unto the <i>homies and palones</i>, the disciples suffered <i>her</i> not.
    </li>
    <li>And certain of the <i>dowriest</i> of Asia, which were <i>her</i> <i>bencoves</i>, <i>laued</i> unto <i>her</i>, desiring <i>her</i> that <i>she</i> would not adventure himself into the theatre.
    </li>
    <li>Some therefore <i>screeched</i> <i>una</i> <i>fakement</i>, and some another: for the assembly was confused: and the more part knew not wherefore they were <i>troll</i> together.
    </li>
    <li>And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the <i>kosher homies</i> putting <i>her</i> forward. And Alexander beckoned with the <i>famble</i>, and would have made <i>her</i> defence unto the <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But when they knew that <i>she</i> was a <i>kosher homie</i>, all with <i>una</i> <i>cackling fakement</i> about the space of <i>dewey</i> hours <i>screeched</i> out, <i>dowry</i> is Diana of the Ephesians.
    </li>
    <li>And when the townclerk had appeased the <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Ye <i>homies</i> of Ephesus, what <i>homie</i> is there that knoweth not how that the <i>smoke</i> of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the <i>dowry</i> goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?
    </li>
    <li><i>Vardaing</i> then that these <i>fakements</i> cannot be <i>cackled</i> against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do <i>nishter</i> rashly.
    </li>
    <li>For ye have brought hither these <i>homies</i>, which are <i>nishta</i> robbers of <i>meshigener carseys</i>, <i>nishta</i> yet blasphemers of your goddess.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with <i>her</i>, have a matter against any <i>homie</i>, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead <i>una</i> another.
    </li>
    <li>But if ye enquire any <i>fakement</i> concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.
    </li>
    <li>For we are in danger to be <i>screeched</i> in question for this <i>journo</i>&#8216;s uproar, there being no cause whereby we may <i>parker</i> an account of this concourse.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> had thus <i>cackled</i>, <i>she</i> dismissed the assembly.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 20</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And after the uproar was ceased, <i>Pauline</i> <i>screeched</i> unto <i>her</i> the disciples, and embraced them, and <i>trolled off</i> for to <i>troll</i> into Macedonia.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> had <i>trolled</i> over those parts, and had <i>parkered</i> them <i>dowry</i> exhortation, <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> into Greece,
    </li>
    <li>And there <i>letted</i> <i>trey</i> months. And when the <i>kosher homies</i> <i>laued</i> wait for <i>her</i>, as <i>she</i> was about to sail into Syria, <i>she</i> purposed to return through Macedonia.
    </li>
    <li>And there accompanied <i>her</i> into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.
    </li>
    <li>These going before tarried for us at Troas.
    </li>
    <li>And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened <i>pannan</i>, and <i>trolled</i> unto them to Troas in <i>chinker</i> days; where we <i>letted</i> <i>setter</i> days.
    </li>
    <li>And upon the first <i>journo</i> of the week, when the disciples <i>trolled</i> together to break <i>pannan</i>, <i>Pauline</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, ready to <i>troll off</i> on the morrow; and continued <i>her</i> <i>cackle</i> until midnight.
    </li>
    <li>And there were many <i>sparkles</i> in the upper <i>booth</i>, where they were gathered together.
    </li>
    <li>And there sat in a window a certain <i>bean cove</i> named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep <i>letty</i>: and as <i>Pauline</i> was long <i>cackling</i>, <i>she</i> sunk down with <i>letty</i>, and fell down from the third loft, and was <i>lelled</i> up <i>stiff</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Pauline</i> <i>trolled</i> down, and fell on <i>her</i>, and embracing <i>her</i> <i>cackled</i>, Trouble not yourselves; for <i>her</i> life is in <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>When <i>she</i> therefore was <i>troll</i> up again, and had broken <i>pannan</i>, and <i>jarried</i>, and talked a long while, even till break of <i>journo</i>, so <i>she</i> <i>trolled off</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they brought the <i>bean cove</i> alive, and were not a <i>bijou</i> comforted.
    </li>
    <li>And we <i>trolled</i> before to <i>lattie on water</i>, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to <i>lell</i> in <i>Pauline</i>: for so had <i>she</i> appointed, minding himself to <i>troll</i> afoot.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> met with us at Assos, we <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> in, and <i>trolled</i> to Mitylene.
    </li>
    <li>And we sailed thence, and <i>trolled</i> the next <i>journo</i> over against Chios; and the next <i>journo</i> we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next <i>journo</i> we <i>trolled</i> to Miletus.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>Pauline</i> had determined to sail by Ephesus, because <i>she</i> would not spend the time in Asia: for <i>she</i> hasted, if it were possible for <i>her</i>, to be at Jerusalem the <i>journo</i> of Pentecost.
    </li>
    <li>And from Miletus <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> to Ephesus, and <i>screeched</i> the <i>fungi</i> of the <i>meshigener carsey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when they were <i>troll</i> to <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Ye know, from the first <i>journo</i> that I <i>trolled</i> into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,
    </li>
    <li>Serving the <i>Duchess</i> with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the <i>kosher homies</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And how I kept back <i>nishter</i> that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from <i>lattie</i> to <i>lattie</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Testifying both to the <i>kosher homies</i>, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward <i>Gloria</i>, and faith toward our <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And now, <i>varda</i>, I <i>troll</i> bound in the <i>Fairy</i> unto Jerusalem, not knowing the <i>fakements</i> that shall befall me there:
    </li>
    <li>Save that the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i> witnesseth in every <i>smoke</i>, <i>cackling</i> that bonds and afflictions <i>lett</i> me.
    </li>
    <li>But none of these <i>fakements</i> <i>troll</i> me, <i>nishta</i> count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have <i>lalled</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i>, to testify the <i>gossip</i> of the <i>gracie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And now, <i>varda</i>, I know that ye all, among whom I have <i>trolled</i> <i>cackling</i> the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>, shall <i>varda</i> my <i>eke</i> <i>nishta</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore I <i>lell</i> you to record this <i>journo</i>, that I am pure from the blood of all <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For I have not shunned to <i>screech</i> unto you all the counsel of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Lell</i> heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i> hath made you overseers, to feed the <i>meshigener carsey</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, which <i>she</i> hath purchased with <i>her</i> own blood.
    </li>
    <li>For I know this, that after my departing shall <i>naff</i> wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.
    </li>
    <li>Also of your own selves shall <i>homies</i> arise, speaking perverse <i>fakements</i>, to draw away disciples after them.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore <i>varda</i>, and remember, that by the space of <i>trey</i> years I ceased not to warn every <i>una</i> <i>nochy</i> and <i>journo</i> with tears.
    </li>
    <li>And now, <i>sisters</i>, I commend you to <i>Gloria</i>, and to the <i>lav</i> of <i>her</i> <i>gracie</i>, which is able to build you up, and to <i>parker</i> you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.
    </li>
    <li>I have <i>ogled</i> no <i>homie</i>&#8216;s silver, or <i>gelt</i>, or <i>schmutter</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, ye yourselves know, that these <i>fambles</i> have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.
    </li>
    <li>I have shewed you all <i>fakements</i>, how that so labouring ye ought to support the <i>nelly</i>, and to remember the <i>lavs</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i>, how <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, It is more <i>fabed</i> to <i>parker</i> than to <i>lall</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> had thus <i>cackled</i>, <i>she</i> kneeled down, and prayed with them all.
    </li>
    <li>And they all <i>parnied</i> sore, and fell on <i>Pauline</i>&#8216;s neck, and kissed <i>her</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Sorrowing most of all for the <i>lavs</i> which <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, that they should <i>varda</i> <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> <i>nishta</i>. And they accompanied <i>her</i> unto the <i>lattie on water</i>.

    <li><i>Any road up</i>, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we <i>trolled</i> with a <i>hettie</i> course unto Coos, and the <i>journo</i> following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:

    <li>And finding a <i>lattie on water</i> sailing over unto Phenicia, we <i>trolled</i> aboard, and set forth.

    <li>Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we <i>dry</i> it on the <i>dry martini</i>, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the <i>lattie on water</i> was to unlade her burden.

    <li>And when we had accomplished those days, we <i>trolled off</i> and <i>trolled</i> our way; and they all brought us on our way, with <i>palone affairs</i> and <i>chavvies</i>, till we were out of the <i>smoke</i>: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.
    </li>
    <li>And when we had <i>lelled</i> our leave <i>una</i> of another, we <i>lelled</i> <i>lattie on water</i>; and they <i>trolled back</i> home again.
    </li>
    <li>And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we <i>trolled</i> to Ptolemais, and saluted the <i>sisters</i>, and <i>letted</i> with them <i>una</i> <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the next <i>journo</i> we that were of <i>Pauline</i>&#8216;s company <i>trolled off</i>, and <i>trolled</i> unto Caesarea: and we entered into the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Phyllis</i> the evangelist, which was <i>una</i> of the <i>setter</i>; and <i>letted</i> with <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the same <i>homie</i> had <i>quarter</i> <i>palone chavvies</i>, <i>nanti charvers</i>, which did prophesy.
    </li>
    <li>And as we tarried there many days, there <i>trolled</i> down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> was <i>troll</i> unto us, <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> <i>Pauline</i>&#8216;s girdle, and bound <i>her</i> own <i>fambles</i> and <i>plates</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>, So shall the <i>kosher homies</i> at Jerusalem bind the <i>homie</i> that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver <i>her</i> into the <i>fambles</i> of the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when we <i>aunt nelled</i> these <i>fakements</i>, both we, and they of that place, besought <i>her</i> not to <i>troll</i> up to Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>Pauline</i> answered, What mean ye to <i>parnie</i> and to break mine <i>thumping cheat</i>? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to <i>cark it</i> at Jerusalem for the name of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> would not be persuaded, we ceased, <i>cackling</i>, The will of the <i>Duchess</i> be done.
    </li>
    <li>And after those days we <i>lelled</i> up our carriages, and <i>trolled</i> up to Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>There <i>trolled</i> with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them <i>una</i> Mnason of Cyprus, an <i>badge</i> disciple, with whom we should lodge.
    </li>
    <li>And when we were <i>troll</i> to Jerusalem, the <i>sisters</i> <i>lalled</i> us gladly.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>journo</i> following <i>Pauline</i> <i>trolled</i> in with us unto James; and all the <i>fungi</i> were present.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> had saluted them, <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> particularly what <i>fakements</i> <i>Gloria</i> had wrought among the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> by <i>her</i> ministry.
    </li>
    <li>And when they <i>aunt nelled</i> it, they glorified the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Thou <i>vardest</i>, <i>sister</i>, how many <i>milles</i> of <i>kosher homies</i> there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:
    </li>
    <li>And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the <i>kosher homies</i> which are among the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> to forsake <i>Maureen</i>, <i>cackling</i> that they ought not to circumcise their <i>chavvies</i>, <i>nishta</i> to <i>mince</i> after the customs.
    </li>
    <li>What is it therefore? the multitude must needs <i>troll</i> together: for they will <i>aunt nell</i> that thou art <i>troll</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Do therefore this that we <i>cackle</i> to thee: We have <i>quarter</i> <i>homies</i> which have a vow on them;
    </li>
    <li>Them <i>lell</i>, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may <i>fatcha</i> their <i>ekes</i>: and all may know that those <i>fakements</i>, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are <i>nishter</i>; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.
    </li>
    <li>As <i>reefing</i> the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> which believe, we have <i>screeved</i> and concluded that they observe no such <i>fakement</i>, save only that they keep themselves from <i>fakements</i> offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from <i>charvering</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>Pauline</i> <i>lelled</i> the <i>homies</i>, and the next <i>journo</i> purifying himself with them entered into the <i>holy carsey</i>, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an <i>parkering</i> should be offered for every <i>una</i> of them.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>setter</i> days were almost ended, the <i>kosher homies</i> which were of Asia, when they <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i> in the <i>holy carsey</i>, stirred up all the <i>homies and palones</i>, and <i>laued</i> <i>fambles</i> on <i>her</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Screeching</i> out, <i>homies</i> of Israel, help: This is the <i>homie</i>, that teacheth all <i>homies</i> every where against the <i>homies and palones</i>, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the <i>holy carsey</i>, and hath <i>dingy</i> this <i>fabulosa</i> place.
    </li>
    <li>(For they had <i>vardad</i> before with <i>her</i> in the <i>smoke</i> Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that <i>Pauline</i> had brought into the <i>holy carsey</i>. )
    </li>
    <li>And all the <i>smoke</i> was <i>trolled</i>, and the <i>homies and palones</i> ran together: and they <i>lelled</i> <i>Pauline</i>, and drew <i>her</i> out of the <i>holy carsey</i>: and forthwith the doors were shut.
    </li>
    <li>And as they <i>trolled</i> about to <i>ferricadoza</i> <i>her</i>, tidings <i>trolled</i> unto the <i>dowriest</i> captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.
    </li>
    <li>Who immediately <i>lelled</i> <i>butch homies</i> and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they <i>vardad</i> the <i>dowriest</i> captain and the <i>butch homies</i>, they <i>dry</i> beating of <i>Pauline</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>dowriest</i> captain <i>trolled</i> near, and <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i>, and commanded <i>her</i> to be bound with <i>dewey</i> chains; and demanded who <i>she</i> was, and what <i>she</i> had done.
    </li>
    <li>And some <i>screeched</i> <i>una</i> <i>fakement</i>, some another, among the multitude: and when <i>she</i> could not know the certainty for the tumult, <i>she</i> commanded <i>her</i> to be <i>lelled</i> into the <i>butch lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> upon the stairs, so it was, that <i>she</i> was borne of the <i>butch homies</i> for the <i>slapping</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For the multitude of the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>trolled after</i> after, <i>screeching</i>, Away with <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And as <i>Pauline</i> was to be led into the <i>butch lattie</i>, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>dowriest</i> captain, May I <i>cackle</i> unto thee? Who <i>cackled</i>, Canst thou <i>cackle</i> Greek?
    </li>
    <li>Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the <i>nishta smoke</i> <i>quarter</i> <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i> that were murderers?
    </li>
    <li>But <i>Pauline</i> <i>cackled</i>, I am a <i>homie</i> which am a <i>kosher homie</i> of Tarsus, a <i>smoke</i> in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean <i>smoke</i>: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to <i>cackle</i> unto the <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> had <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> licence, <i>Pauline</i> stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the <i>famble</i> unto the <i>homies and palones</i>. And when there was made a <i>dowry</i> <i>nishta cackle</i>, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them in the <i>Kosher Homie</i> <i>polari</i>, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 22</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Homies</i>, <i>sisters</i>, and <i>aunties</i>, <i>aunt nell</i> ye my defence which I make now unto you.
    </li>
    <li>(And when they <i>aunt nelled</i> that <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> in the <i>Kosher Homie</i> <i>polari</i> to them, they kept the more <i>nishta cackle</i>: and <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i>,)
    </li>
    <li>I am verily a <i>homie</i> which am a <i>kosher homie</i>, born in Tarsus, a <i>smoke</i> in Cilicia, yet brought up in this <i>smoke</i> at the <i>plates</i> of Gamaliel, and taught according to the <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i> manner of the law of the <i>aunties</i>, and was zealous toward <i>Gloria</i>, as ye all are this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>chivvied</i> this way unto the <i>carking it</i>, binding and delivering into prisons both <i>homies</i> and <i>palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>As also the high <i>godly homie</i> doth bear me <i>varda-ing fakement</i>, and all the estate of the <i>fungi</i>: from whom also I <i>lalled</i> letters unto the <i>sisters</i>, and <i>trolled</i> to Damascus, to <i>parker</i> them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be <i>zsa zsa-ed</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, that, as I made my journey, and was <i>troll</i> <i>ajax</i> unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a <i>dowry</i> <i>sparkle</i> round about me.
    </li>
    <li>And I fell unto the ground, and <i>aunt nelled</i> a <i>cackling fakement</i> <i>cackling</i> unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
    </li>
    <li>And I answered, Who art thou, <i>Duchess</i>? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, I am <i>Josie</i> of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.
    </li>
    <li>And they that were with me <i>vardad</i> indeed the <i>sparkle</i>, and were afraid; but they <i>aunt nelled</i> not the <i>cackling fakement</i> of <i>her</i> that <i>cackled</i> to me.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>cackled</i>, What shall I do, <i>Duchess</i>? And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, Arise, and <i>troll</i> into Damascus; and there it shall be <i>cackled</i> thee of all <i>fakements</i> which are appointed for thee to do.
    </li>
    <li>And when I could not <i>varda</i> for the <i>fabeness</i> of that <i>sparkle</i>, being led by the <i>famble</i> of them that were with me, I <i>trolled</i> into Damascus.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>una</i> Ananias, a devout <i>homie</i> according to the law, having a <i>bona</i> report of all the <i>kosher homies</i> which <i>letted</i> there,
    </li>
    <li><i>Trolled</i> unto me, and stood, and <i>cackled</i> unto me, <i>sister</i> Saul, <i>lall</i> thy <i>vardaing</i>. And the same hour I looked up upon <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, The <i>Gloria</i> of our <i>aunties</i> hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know <i>her</i> will, and <i>varda</i> that Just <i>una</i>, and shouldest <i>aunt nell</i> the <i>cackling fakement</i> of <i>her</i> <i>screech</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For thou shalt be <i>her</i> <i>varda-ing fakement</i> unto all <i>homies</i> of what thou hast <i>vardad</i> and <i>aunt nelled</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and <i>dhobie</i> away thy <i>kertervers</i>, calling on the name of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, that, when I was <i>troll</i> again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the <i>holy carsey</i>, I was in a trance;
    </li>
    <li>And <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i> <i>cackling</i> unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not <i>lall</i> thy testimony concerning me.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>cackled</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, they know that I imprisoned and <i>zsa zsa-ed</i> in every synagogue them that believed on thee:
    </li>
    <li>And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto <i>her</i> <i>carking it</i>, and kept the <i>clobber</i> of them that <i>ferricadoozaed</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, <i>troll off</i>: for I will <i>lau</i> thee far hence unto the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> audience unto this <i>lav</i>, and then lifted up their voices, and <i>cackled</i>, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that <i>she</i> should live.
    </li>
    <li>And as they <i>screeched</i> out, and cast off their <i>zhoosh</i>, and threw dust into the air,
    </li>
    <li>The <i>dowriest</i> captain commanded <i>her</i> to be brought into the <i>butch lattie</i>, and bade that <i>she</i> should be examined by scourging; that <i>she</i> might know wherefore they <i>screeched</i> so against <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And as they bound <i>her</i> with thongs, <i>Pauline</i> <i>cackled</i> unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a <i>homie</i> that is a Roman, and uncondemned?
    </li>
    <li>When the centurion <i>aunt nelled</i> that, <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> and <i>cackled</i> the <i>dowriest</i> captain, <i>cackling</i>, <i>lell</i> heed what thou doest: for this <i>homie</i> is a Roman.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>dowriest</i> captain <i>trolled</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>cackle</i> me, art thou a Roman? <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>any road up</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest</i> captain answered, With a <i>dowry</i> sum obtained I this freedom. And <i>Pauline</i> <i>cackled</i>, But I was free born.
    </li>
    <li>Then straightway they <i>trolled off</i> from <i>her</i> which should have examined <i>her</i>: and the <i>dowriest</i> captain also was afraid, after <i>she</i> knew that <i>she</i> was a Roman, and because <i>she</i> had bound <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>On the morrow, because <i>she</i> would have known the certainty wherefore <i>she</i> was accused of the <i>kosher homies</i>, <i>she</i> loosed <i>her</i> from <i>her</i> bands, and commanded the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homies</i> and all their council to appear, and brought <i>Pauline</i> down, and set <i>her</i> before them.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 23</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And <i>Pauline</i>, earnestly beholding the council, <i>cackled</i>, <i>homies</i> and <i>sisters</i>, I have lived in all <i>bona</i> conscience before <i>Gloria</i> until this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the high <i>godly homie</i> Ananias commanded them that stood by <i>her</i> to <i>slap</i> <i>her</i> on the <i>screech</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> <i>Pauline</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>Gloria</i> shall <i>slap</i> thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to <i>beak</i> me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?
    </li>
    <li>And they that stood by <i>cackled</i>, Revilest thou <i>Gloria</i>&#8216;s high <i>godly homie</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> <i>Pauline</i>, I wist not, <i>sisters</i>, that <i>she</i> was the high <i>godly homie</i>: for it is <i>screeved</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>cackle</i> <i>nana</i> of the ruler of thy <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But when <i>Pauline</i> perceived that the <i>una</i> part were Sadducees, and the other <i>lily laws</i>, <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> out in the council, <i>homies</i> and <i>sisters</i>, I am a <i>lily law</i>, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of a <i>lily law</i>: of the hope and resurrection of the <i>stiff</i> I am <i>screeched</i> in question.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> had so <i>cackled</i>, there arose a dissension between the <i>lily laws</i> and the Sadducees: and the multitude was <i>medzered</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For the Sadducees <i>cackle</i> that there is no resurrection, <i>nishta</i> <i>fairy</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>Fairy</i>: but the <i>lily laws</i> <i>dish</i> both.
    </li>
    <li>And there arose a <i>dowry</i> <i>screech</i>: and the <i>betty bracelets</i> that were of the <i>lily laws</i>&#8216; part arose, and strove, <i>cackling</i>, We find no <i>nana</i> in this <i>homie</i>: but if a <i>Fairy</i> or an <i>fairy</i> hath <i>cackled</i> to <i>her</i>, let us not <i>palaver</i> against <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when there arose a <i>dowry</i> dissension, the <i>dowriest</i> captain, fearing lest <i>Pauline</i> should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the <i>butch homies</i> to <i>troll</i> down, and to <i>lell</i> <i>her</i> by force from among them, and to <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> into the <i>butch lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>nochy</i> following the <i>Duchess</i> stood by <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Be of <i>bona</i> cheer, <i>Pauline</i>: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear <i>varda-ing fakement</i> also at Rome.
    </li>
    <li>And when it was <i>journo</i>, certain of the <i>kosher homies</i> banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, <i>cackling</i> that they would <i>nishta</i> <i>jarry</i> <i>nishta</i> <i>buvare</i> till they had <i>ferricadozad</i> <i>Pauline</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they were more than <i>quarter dacha</i> which had made this conspiracy.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>trolled</i> to the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homies</i> and <i>fungi</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, We have bound ourselves under a <i>dowry</i> curse, that we will <i>jarry</i> <i>nishter</i> until we have <i>ferricadoozed</i> <i>Pauline</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now therefore ye with the council signify to the <i>dowriest</i> captain that <i>she</i> <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning <i>her</i>: and we, or ever <i>she</i> <i>troll</i> near, are ready to <i>ferricadoza</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>Pauline</i>&#8216;s sister&#8217;s <i>homie chavvie</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> of their lying in wait, <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> and entered into the <i>butch lattie</i>, and <i>cackled</i> <i>Pauline</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>Pauline</i> <i>screeched</i> <i>una</i> of the centurions unto <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>parker</i> this <i>bean cove</i> unto the <i>dowriest</i> captain: for <i>she</i> hath a certain <i>fakement</i> to <i>cackle</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i>, and brought <i>her</i> to the <i>dowriest</i> captain, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>Pauline</i> the prisoner <i>screeched</i> me unto <i>her</i>, and prayed me to <i>parker</i> this <i>bean cove</i> unto thee, who hath something to <i>cackle</i> unto thee.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>dowriest</i> captain <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> by the <i>famble</i>, and <i>trolled</i> with <i>her</i> aside privately, and asked <i>her</i>, What is that thou hast to <i>cackle</i> me?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, The <i>kosher homies</i> have agreed to <i>fancy</i> thee that thou wouldest <i>parker</i> down <i>Pauline</i> to morrow into the council, as though they would enquire somewhat of <i>her</i> more perfectly.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>nix</i> thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for <i>her</i> of them more than <i>quarter dacha</i> <i>homies</i>, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will <i>nishta</i> <i>jarry</i> <i>nishta</i> <i>buvare</i> till they have <i>ferricadozad</i> <i>her</i>: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.
    </li>
    <li>So the <i>dowriest</i> captain then let the <i>bean cove</i> <i>troll off</i>, and charged <i>her</i>, <i>varda</i> thou <i>cackle</i> no <i>homie</i> that thou hast shewed these <i>fakements</i> to me.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>dewey</i> centurions, <i>cackling</i>, Make ready <i>dewey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>butch homies</i> to <i>troll</i> to Caesarea, and horsemen <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> and <i>dacha</i>, and spearmen <i>dewey</i> <i>chenter</i>, at the third hour of the <i>nochy</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And provide them beasts, that they may set <i>Pauline</i> on, and <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> safe unto Felix the governor.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>screeved</i> a letter after this manner:
    </li>
    <li>Claudius Lysias unto the most <i>fantabulosa</i> governor Felix sendeth greeting.
    </li>
    <li>This <i>homie</i> was <i>lelled</i> of the <i>kosher homies</i>, and should have been <i>ferricadozad</i> of them: then <i>trolled</i> I with an army, and rescued <i>her</i>, having understood that <i>she</i> was a Roman.
    </li>
    <li>And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused <i>her</i>, I brought <i>her</i> forth into their council:
    </li>
    <li>Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have <i>nishter</i> <i>laued</i> to <i>her</i> charge <i>bona</i> of <i>carking it</i> or of bonds.
    </li>
    <li>And when it was <i>cackled</i> me how that the <i>kosher homies</i> <i>laued</i> wait for the <i>homie</i>, I <i>laued</i> straightway to thee, and <i>parkered</i> <i>butch lav</i> to <i>her</i> accusers also to <i>cackle</i> before thee what they had against <i>her</i>. Farewell.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>butch homies</i>, as it was commanded them, <i>lelled</i> <i>Pauline</i>, and brought <i>her</i> by <i>nochy</i> to Antipatris.
    </li>
    <li>On the morrow they <i>dry</i> the horsemen to <i>troll</i> with <i>her</i>, and <i>trolled back to</i> the <i>butch lattie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Who, when they <i>trolled</i> to Caesarea and <i>laued</i> the epistle to the governor, presented <i>Pauline</i> also before <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when the governor had <i>varda the lavs</i> the letter, <i>she</i> asked of what province <i>she</i> was. And when <i>she</i> understood that <i>she</i> was of Cilicia;
    </li>
    <li>I will <i>aunt nell</i> thee, <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i>, when thine accusers are also <i>troll</i>. And <i>she</i> commanded <i>her</i> to be kept in Herod&#8217;s judgment hall.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 24</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And after <i>chinker</i> days Ananias the high <i>godly homie</i> <i>trolled down</i> with the <i>fungi</i>, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against <i>Pauline</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> was <i>screeched</i> forth, Tertullus began to accuse <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>vardaing</i> that by thee we enjoy <i>dowry</i> quietness, and that <i>dowry</i> <i>bona</i> deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,
    </li>
    <li>We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.
    </li>
    <li>Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest <i>aunt nell</i> us of thy clemency a <i>nishta dowry</i> <i>lavs</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For we have found this <i>homie</i> a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the <i>kosher homies</i> throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:
    </li>
    <li>Who also hath <i>trolled</i> about to <i>billingsgate</i> the <i>holy carsey</i>: whom we <i>lelled</i>, and would have judged according to our law.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>dowriest</i> captain Lysias <i>trolled</i> upon us, and with <i>dowry</i> <i>slapping</i> <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> away out of our <i>fambles</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Commanding <i>her</i> accusers to <i>troll</i> unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest <i>lell</i> knowledge of all these <i>fakements</i>, whereof we accuse <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>kosher homies</i> also assented, <i>cackling</i> that these <i>fakements</i> were so.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>Pauline</i>, after that the governor had beckoned unto <i>her</i> to <i>cackle</i>, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a <i>beak</i> unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:
    </li>
    <li>Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but <i>kenza</i> days since I <i>trolled</i> up to Jerusalem for to worship.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>nishta</i> found me in the <i>holy carsey</i> disputing with any <i>homie</i>, <i>nishta</i> raising up the <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>nishta</i> in the synagogues, <i>nishta</i> in the <i>smoke</i>:
    </li>
    <li><i>Nishta</i> can they prove the <i>fakements</i> whereof they now accuse me.
    </li>
    <li>But this I <i>dish</i> unto thee, that after the way which they <i>screech</i> heresy, so worship I the <i>Gloria</i> of my <i>aunties</i>, believing all <i>fakements</i> which are <i>screeved</i> in the law and in the prophets:
    </li>
    <li>And have hope toward <i>Gloria</i>, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the <i>stiff</i>, both of the just and unjust.
    </li>
    <li>And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void to offence toward <i>Gloria</i>, and toward <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now after many years I <i>trolled</i> to <i>parker</i> alms to my nation, and <i>parkerings</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Whereupon certain <i>kosher homies</i> from Asia found me purified in the <i>holy carsey</i>, <i>nishta</i> with multitude, <i>nishta</i> with tumult.
    </li>
    <li>Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.
    </li>
    <li>Or else let these same here <i>cackle</i>, if they have found any <i>nana</i> doing in me, while I stood before the council,
    </li>
    <li>Except it be for this <i>una</i> <i>cackling fakement</i>, that I <i>screeched</i> standing among them, <i>reefing</i> the resurrection of the <i>stiff</i> I am <i>screeched</i> in question by you this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when Felix <i>aunt nelled</i> these <i>fakements</i>, having more <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i> knowledge of that way, <i>she</i> deferred them, and <i>cackled</i>, When Lysias the <i>dowriest</i> captain shall <i>troll</i> down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> commanded a centurion to keep <i>Pauline</i>, and to let <i>her</i> have liberty, and that <i>she</i> should forbid none of <i>her</i> acquaintance to minister or <i>troll</i> unto <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And after certain days, when Felix <i>trolled</i> with <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i> Drusilla, which was a Jewess, <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> for <i>Pauline</i>, and <i>aunt nelled</i> <i>her</i> concerning the faith in <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And as <i>she</i> reasoned of <i>bonaness</i>, temperance, and judgment to <i>troll</i>, Felix trembled, and answered, <i>troll</i> thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will <i>screech</i> for thee.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> hoped also that <i>dinarly</i> should have been <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> of <i>Pauline</i>, that <i>she</i> might loose <i>her</i>: wherefore <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> for <i>her</i> the oftener, and <i>dished the dirt</i> with <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But after <i>dewey</i> years Porcius Festus <i>trolled</i> into Felix&#8217; room: and Felix, willing to shew the <i>kosher homies</i> a pleasure, <i>dry</i> <i>Pauline</i> bound.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 25</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now when Festus was <i>troll</i> into the province, after <i>trey</i> days <i>she</i> <i>trolled up</i> from Caesarea to Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>Then the high <i>godly homie</i> and the <i>dowriest</i> of the <i>kosher homies</i> informed <i>her</i> against <i>Pauline</i>, and besought <i>her</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>fancied</i> favour against <i>her</i>, that <i>she</i> would <i>lau</i> for <i>her</i> to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to <i>ferricadoza</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But Festus answered, that <i>Pauline</i> should be kept at Caesarea, and that <i>she</i> himself would <i>troll off</i> shortly thither.
    </li>
    <li>Let them therefore, <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i>, which among you are able, <i>troll</i> down with me, and accuse this <i>homie</i>, if there be any <i>naffness</i> in <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> had tarried among them more than <i>dacha</i> days, <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> down unto Caesarea; and the next <i>journo</i> sitting on the judgment seat commanded <i>Pauline</i> to be brought.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> was <i>troll</i>, the <i>kosher homies</i> which <i>trolled</i> down from Jerusalem stood round about, and <i>laued</i> many and <i>naff</i> complaints against <i>Pauline</i>, which they could not prove.
    </li>
    <li>While <i>she</i> answered for himself, <i>nishta</i> against the law of the <i>kosher homies</i>, <i>nishta</i> against the <i>holy carsey</i>, <i>nishta</i> yet against Caesar, have I offended any <i>fakement</i> at all.
    </li>
    <li>But Festus, willing to do the <i>kosher homies</i> a pleasure, answered <i>Pauline</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Wilt thou <i>troll</i> up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these <i>fakements</i> before me?
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> <i>Pauline</i>, I stand at Caesar&#8217;s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the <i>kosher homies</i> have I done no wrong, as thou <i>dowry</i> well knowest.
    </li>
    <li>For if I be an offender, or have committed any <i>fakement</i> <i>bona</i> of <i>carking it</i>, I refuse not to <i>cark it</i>: but if there be none of these <i>fakements</i> whereof these accuse me, no <i>homie</i> may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.
    </li>
    <li>Then Festus, when <i>she</i> had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou <i>troll</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And after certain days <i>dowriest homie</i> Agrippa and Bernice <i>trolled</i> unto Caesarea to salute Festus.
    </li>
    <li>And when they had been there many days, Festus <i>screeched</i> <i>Pauline</i>&#8216;s cause unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>, <i>cackling</i>, There is a certain <i>homie</i> <i>dry</i> in bonds by Felix:
    </li>
    <li>About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homies</i> and the <i>fungi</i> of the <i>kosher homies</i> informed me, desiring to have judgment against <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any <i>homie</i> to <i>cark it</i>, before that <i>she</i> which is accused have the accusers <i>eke</i> to <i>eke</i>, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime <i>laued</i> against <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore, when they were <i>troll</i> hither, <i>nanti</i> any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the <i>homie</i> to be brought forth.
    </li>
    <li>Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such <i>fakements</i> as I supposed:
    </li>
    <li>But had certain questions against <i>her</i> of their own superstition, and of <i>una</i> <i>Josie</i>, which was <i>stiff</i>, whom <i>Pauline</i> affirmed to be alive.
    </li>
    <li>And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked <i>her</i> whether <i>she</i> would <i>troll</i> to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.
    </li>
    <li>But when <i>Pauline</i> had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded <i>her</i> to be kept till I might <i>lau</i> <i>her</i> to Caesar.
    </li>
    <li>Then Agrippa <i>cackled</i> unto Festus, I would also <i>aunt nell</i> the <i>homie</i> myself. To morrow, <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i>, thou shalt <i>aunt nell</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And on the morrow, when Agrippa was <i>troll</i>, and Bernice, with <i>dowry</i> pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the <i>dowriest</i> captains, and principal <i>homies</i> of the <i>smoke</i>, at Festus&#8217; <i>butch lav</i> <i>Pauline</i> was brought forth.
    </li>
    <li>And Festus <i>cackled</i>, <i>dowriest homie</i> Agrippa, and all <i>homies</i> which are here present with us, ye <i>varda</i> this <i>homie</i>, about whom all the multitude of the <i>kosher homies</i> have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, <i>screeching</i> that <i>she</i> ought not to live any longer.
    </li>
    <li>But when I found that <i>she</i> had committed <i>nishter</i> <i>bona</i> of <i>carking it</i>, and that <i>she</i> himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to <i>lau</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Of whom I have no certain <i>fakement</i> to <i>screeve</i> unto my <i>Duchess</i>. Wherefore I have brought <i>her</i> forth before you, and specially before thee, O <i>dowriest homie</i> Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to <i>screeve</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For it seemeth to me unreasonable to <i>lau</i> a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes <i>laued</i> against <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 26</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Then Agrippa <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Pauline</i>, Thou art permitted to <i>cackle</i> for thyself. Then <i>Pauline</i> stretched forth the <i>famble</i>, and answered for himself:
    </li>
    <li>I think myself happy, <i>dowriest homie</i> Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this <i>journo</i> before thee <i>reefing</i> all the <i>fakements</i> whereof I am accused of the <i>kosher homies</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the <i>kosher homies</i>: wherefore I beseech thee to <i>aunt nell</i> me patiently.
    </li>
    <li>My manner of life from my <i>beandom</i>, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the <i>kosher homies</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a <i>lily law</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of <i>Gloria</i>, unto our <i>aunties</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Unto which promise our <i>kenza</i> tribes, instantly serving <i>Gloria</i> <i>journo</i> and <i>nochy</i>, hope to <i>troll</i>. For which hope&#8217;s sake, <i>dowriest homie</i> Agrippa, I am accused of the <i>kosher homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Why should it be thought a <i>fakement</i> incredible with you, that <i>Gloria</i> should raise the <i>stiff</i>?
    </li>
    <li>I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many <i>fakements</i> contrary to the name of <i>Josie</i> of Nazareth.
    </li>
    <li>Which <i>fakement</i> I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in <i>charpering carsey</i>, having <i>lalled</i> authority from the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homies</i>; and when they were put to <i>carking it</i>, I <i>parkered</i> my <i>cackling fakement</i> against them.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>zsa zsa-ed</i> them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I <i>chivvied</i> them even unto strange <i>smokes</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Whereupon as I <i>trolled</i> to Damascus with authority and commission from the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homies</i>,
    </li>
    <li>At midday, O <i>dowriest homie</i>, I <i>vardad</i> in the way a <i>sparkle</i> from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.
    </li>
    <li>And when we were all fallen to the earth, I <i>aunt nelled</i> a <i>cackling fakement</i> speaking unto me, and <i>cackling</i> in the <i>Kosher Homie</i> <i>polari</i>, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>cackled</i>, Who art thou, <i>Duchess</i>? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, I am <i>Josie</i> whom thou persecutest.
    </li>
    <li>But rise, and stand upon thy <i>plates</i>: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a <i>varda-ing fakement</i> both of these <i>fakements</i> which thou hast <i>vardad</i>, and of those <i>fakements</i> in the which I will appear unto thee;
    </li>
    <li>Delivering thee from the <i>homies and palones</i>, and from the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>, unto whom now I <i>lau</i> thee,
    </li>
    <li>To open their <i>ogles</i>, and to turn them from <i>munge</i> to <i>sparkle</i>, and from the power of <i>Sadie</i> unto <i>Gloria</i>, that they may <i>lall</i> forgiveness of <i>kertervers</i>, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.
    </li>
    <li>Whereupon, O <i>dowriest homie</i> Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:
    </li>
    <li>But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>, that they should repent and turn to <i>Gloria</i>, and do works meet for repentance.
    </li>
    <li>For these causes the <i>kosher homies</i> caught me in the <i>holy carsey</i>, and <i>trolled</i> about to <i>ferricadoza</i> me.
    </li>
    <li>Having therefore obtained help of <i>Gloria</i>, I continue unto this <i>journo</i>, witnessing both to <i>pogey</i> and <i>dowry</i>, <i>cackling</i> none other <i>fakements</i> than those which the prophets and <i>Maureen</i> did <i>cackle</i> should <i>troll</i>:
    </li>
    <li>That <i>Crystal</i> should suffer, and that <i>she</i> should be the first that should rise from the <i>stiff</i>, and should shew <i>sparkle</i> unto the <i>homies and palones</i>, and to the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And as <i>she</i> thus <i>cackled</i> for himself, Festus <i>cackled</i> with a loud <i>cackling fakement</i>, <i>Pauline</i>, thou art beside thyself; <i>dowry</i> learning doth make thee mad.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but <i>cackle</i> forth the <i>lavs</i> of truth and soberness.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>dowriest homie</i> knoweth of these <i>fakements</i>, before whom also I <i>cackle</i> freely: for I am persuaded that none of these <i>fakements</i> are hidden from <i>her</i>; for this <i>fakement</i> was not done in a corner.
    </li>
    <li><i>Dowriest homie</i> Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.
    </li>
    <li>Then Agrippa <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Pauline</i>, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Pauline</i> <i>cackled</i>, I would to <i>Gloria</i>, that not only thou, but also all that <i>aunt nell</i> me this <i>journo</i>, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> had thus <i>cackled</i>, the <i>dowriest homie</i> rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:
    </li>
    <li>And when they were <i>trolled</i> aside, they talked between themselves, <i>cackling</i>, This <i>homie</i> doeth <i>nishter</i> <i>bona</i> of <i>carking it</i> or of bonds.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> Agrippa unto Festus, This <i>homie</i> might have been set at liberty, if <i>she</i> had not appealed unto Caesar.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 27</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they <i>laued</i> <i>Pauline</i> and certain other prisoners unto <i>una</i> named Julius, a centurion of Augustus&#8217; band.
    </li>
    <li>And entering into a <i>lattie on water</i> of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; <i>una</i> Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.
    </li>
    <li>And the next <i>journo</i> we <i>reefed</i> at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated <i>Pauline</i>, and <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> liberty to <i>troll</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>bencoves</i> to refresh himself.
    </li>
    <li>And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.
    </li>
    <li>And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we <i>trolled</i> to Myra, a <i>smoke</i> of Lycia.
    </li>
    <li>And there the centurion found a <i>lattie on water</i> of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and <i>she</i> put us therein.
    </li>
    <li>And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were <i>troll</i> over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;
    </li>
    <li>And, hardly passing it, <i>trolled</i> unto a place which is <i>screeched</i> The <i>filly</i> havens; <i>ajax</i> whereunto was the <i>smoke</i> of Lasea.
    </li>
    <li>Now when <i>dowry</i> time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the <i>nishta manjarry</i> was now already past, <i>Pauline</i> admonished them,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackled</i> unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and <i>dowry</i> damage, not only of the lading and <i>lattie on water</i>, but also of our lives.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> the centurion believed the master and the owner of the <i>lattie on water</i>, more than those <i>fakements</i> which were <i>cackled</i> by <i>Pauline</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to <i>troll off</i> thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and <i>lettieth</i> toward the south west and north west.
    </li>
    <li>And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete.
    </li>
    <li>But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, <i>screeched</i> Euroclydon.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>lattie on water</i> was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>trolling</i> under a certain island which is <i>screeched</i> Clauda, we had <i>dowry</i> <i>acting dickey</i> to <i>troll</i> by the boat:
    </li>
    <li>Which when they had <i>lelled</i> up, they used helps, undergirding the <i>lattie on water</i>; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.
    </li>
    <li>And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next <i>journo</i> they lightened the <i>lattie on water</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And the third <i>journo</i> we cast out with our own <i>fambles</i> the tackling of the <i>lattie on water</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>nishta</i> sun <i>nishta</i> <i>twinkling fakements</i> in many days appeared, and no <i>pogey</i> tempest <i>lett</i> on us, all hope that we should be saved was then <i>lelled</i> away.
    </li>
    <li>But after long abstinence <i>Pauline</i> stood forth in the midst of them, and <i>cackled</i>, Sirs, ye should have <i>aunt nelled</i> unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.
    </li>
    <li>And now I exhort you to be of <i>bona</i> cheer: for there shall be no loss of any <i>homie</i>&#8216;s life among you, but of the <i>lattie on water</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For there stood by me this <i>nochy</i> the <i>fairy</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, whose I am, and whom I serve,
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackling</i>, Fear not, <i>Pauline</i>; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>parkered</i> thee all them that sail with thee.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore, sirs, be of <i>bona</i> cheer: for I believe <i>Gloria</i>, that it shall be even as it was <i>cackled</i> me.
    </li>
    <li>Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.
    </li>
    <li>But when the fourteenth <i>nochy</i> was <i>troll</i>, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;
    </li>
    <li>And sounded, and found it <i>dewey dacha</i> fathoms: and when they had <i>trolled</i> a <i>bijou</i> further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.
    </li>
    <li>Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast <i>quarter</i> anchors out of the stern, and wished for the <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And as the shipmen were about to <i>scarper</i> out of the <i>lattie on water</i>, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,
    </li>
    <li><i>Pauline</i> <i>cackled</i> to the centurion and to the <i>butch homies</i>, Except these <i>lett</i> in the <i>lattie on water</i>, ye cannot be saved.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>butch homies</i> cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.
    </li>
    <li>And while the <i>journo</i> was <i>trolling</i> on, <i>Pauline</i> besought them all to <i>lell</i> <i>carnish</i>, <i>cackling</i>, This <i>journo</i> is the fourteenth <i>journo</i> that ye have tarried and continued <i>nistha manjarrying</i>, having <i>lelled</i> <i>nishter</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore I pray you to <i>lell</i> some <i>carnish</i>: for this is for your health: for there shall not an <i>riah</i> fall from the <i>eke</i> of any of you.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> had thus <i>cackled</i>, <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> <i>pannan</i>, and <i>parkered</i> thanks to <i>Gloria</i> in presence of them all: and when <i>she</i> had broken it, <i>she</i> began to <i>jarry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then were they all of <i>bona</i> cheer, and they also <i>lelled</i> some <i>carnish</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And we were in all in the <i>lattie on water</i> <i>dewey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> and sixteen <i>nishta lucoddies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when they had <i>jarried</i> enough, they lightened the <i>lattie on water</i>, and cast out the wheat into the sea.
    </li>
    <li>And when it was <i>journo</i>, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the <i>lattie on water</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when they had <i>lelled</i> up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.
    </li>
    <li>And falling into a place where <i>dewey</i> seas met, they ran the <i>lattie on water</i> aground; and the forepart stuck <i>nishta manjarry</i>, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the <i>slapping</i> of the waves.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>butch homies</i>&#8216; counsel was to <i>ferricadoza</i> the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.
    </li>
    <li>But the centurion, willing to save <i>Pauline</i>, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>lettie</i>, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the <i>lattie on water</i>. And so it <i>trolled</i> to pass, that they <i>scarpered</i> all safe to land.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 28</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And when they were <i>scarpered</i>, then they knew that the island was <i>screeched</i> Melita.
    </li>
    <li>And the barbarous <i>homies and palones</i> shewed us no <i>bijou</i> kindness: for they kindled a <i>binco fakement</i>, and <i>lalled</i> us every <i>una</i>, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>Pauline</i> had gathered a bundle of sticks, and <i>laued</i> them on the <i>binco fakement</i>, there <i>trolled</i> a viper out of the heat, and fastened on <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when the barbarians <i>vardad</i> the venomous beast hang on <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>, they <i>cackled</i> among themselves, No doubt this <i>homie</i> is a murderer, whom, though <i>she</i> hath <i>scarpered</i> the sea, yet <i>the rights</i> suffereth not to live.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> shook off the beast into the <i>binco fakement</i>, and felt no harm.
    </li>
    <li>Howbeit they looked when <i>she</i> should have swollen, or fallen down <i>stiff</i> suddenly: but after they had looked a <i>dowry</i> while, and <i>vardad</i> no harm <i>troll</i> to <i>her</i>, they changed their minds, and <i>cackled</i> that <i>she</i> was a <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>In the same quarters were possessions of the <i>dowriest</i> <i>homie</i> of the island, whose name was Publius; who <i>lalled</i> us, and lodged us <i>trey</i> days courteously.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, that the <i>Auntie</i> of Publius <i>lett</i> sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom <i>Pauline</i> entered in, and prayed, and <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i> on <i>her</i>, and healed <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, <i>trolled</i>, and were healed:
    </li>
    <li>Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we <i>trolled off</i>, they laded us with such <i>fakements</i> as were necessary.
    </li>
    <li>And after <i>trey</i> months we <i>trolled off</i> in a <i>lattie on water</i> of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.
    </li>
    <li>And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there <i>trey</i> days.
    </li>
    <li>And from thence we fetched a compass, and <i>trolled</i> to Rhegium: and after <i>una</i> <i>journo</i> the south wind blew, and we <i>trolled</i> the next <i>journo</i> to Puteoli:
    </li>
    <li>Where we found <i>sisters</i>, and were <i>fancied</i> to tarry with them <i>setter</i> days: and so we <i>trolled</i> toward Rome.
    </li>
    <li>And from thence, when the <i>sisters</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> of us, they <i>trolled</i> to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The <i>trey</i> taverns: whom when <i>Pauline</i> <i>vardad</i>, <i>she</i> thanked <i>Gloria</i>, and <i>lelled</i> courage.
    </li>
    <li>And when we <i>trolled</i> to Rome, the centurion <i>laued</i> the prisoners to the captain of the <i>charpering homie</i>: but <i>Pauline</i> was suffered to <i>lett</i> by himself with a <i>butch homie</i> that kept <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, that after <i>trey</i> days <i>Pauline</i> <i>screeched</i> the <i>dowriest</i> of the <i>kosher homies</i> together: and when they were <i>troll</i> together, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>homies</i> and <i>sisters</i>, though I have committed <i>nishter</i> against the <i>homies and palones</i>, or customs of our <i>aunties</i>, yet was I <i>laued</i> prisoner from Jerusalem into the <i>fambles</i> of the Romans.
    </li>
    <li>Who, when they had examined me, would have let me <i>troll</i>, because there was no cause of <i>carking it</i> in me.
    </li>
    <li>But when the <i>kosher homies</i> <i>cackled</i> against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.
    </li>
    <li>For this cause therefore have I <i>screeched</i> for you, to <i>varda</i> you, and to <i>cackle</i> with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, We <i>nishta</i> <i>lalled</i> letters out of Judaea concerning thee, <i>nishta</i> any of the <i>sisters</i> that <i>trolled</i> shewed or <i>cackled</i> any harm of thee.
    </li>
    <li>But we <i>fancy</i> to <i>aunt nell</i> of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is <i>cackled</i> against.
    </li>
    <li>And when they had appointed <i>her</i> a <i>journo</i>, there <i>trolled</i> many to <i>her</i> into <i>her</i> lodging; to whom <i>she</i> expounded and testified the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>, persuading them concerning <i>Josie</i>, both out of the law of <i>Maureen</i>, and out of the prophets, from morning till <i>bijou nochy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And some believed the <i>fakements</i> which were <i>cackled</i>, and some believed not.
    </li>
    <li>And when they agreed not among themselves, they <i>trolled off</i>, after that <i>Pauline</i> had <i>cackled</i> <i>una</i> <i>lav</i>, Well <i>cackled</i> the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i> by Esaias the prophet unto our <i>aunties</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackling</i>, <i>troll</i> unto this <i>homies and palones</i>, and <i>cackle</i>, Hearing ye shall <i>aunt nell</i>, and shall not understand; and <i>vardaing</i> ye shall <i>varda</i>, and not perceive:
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>thumping cheat</i> of this <i>homies and palones</i> is waxed gross, and their <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> are dull of hearing, and their <i>ogles</i> have they closed; lest they should <i>varda</i> with their <i>ogles</i>, and <i>aunt nell</i> with their <i>aunt nelly cheats</i>, and understand with their <i>thumping cheat</i>, and should be converted, and I should heal them.
    </li>
    <li>Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of <i>Gloria</i> is <i>laued</i> unto the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>, and that they will <i>aunt nell</i> it.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> had <i>cackled</i> these <i>lavs</i>, the <i>kosher homies</i> <i>trolled off</i>, and had <i>dowry</i> reasoning among themselves.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Pauline</i> <i>letted</i> <i>dewey</i> whole years in <i>her</i> own hired <i>lattie</i>, and <i>lalled</i> all that <i>trolled</i> in unto <i>her</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackling</i> the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>, and teaching those <i>fakements</i> which concern the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, with all confidence, no <i>homie</i> forbidding <i>her</i>.
