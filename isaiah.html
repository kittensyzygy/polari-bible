    <h1>Isaiah</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>The vision of Isaiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Amoz, which <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, <i>dowriest homies</i> of Judah.
    </li>
    <li><i>Aunt nell</i>, O heavens, and <i>parker</i> <i>aunt nelling cheat</i>, O earth: for the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>cackled</i>, I have nourished and brought up <i>chavvies</i>, and they have rebelled against me.
    </li>
    <li>The ox knoweth <i>her</i> owner, and the ass <i>her</i> master&#8217;s crib: but Israel doth not know, my <i>homies and palones</i> doth not consider.
    </li>
    <li>Ah sinful nation, a <i>homies and palones</i> laden with <i>codness</i>, a <i>maria</i> of evildoers, <i>chavvies</i> that are corrupters: they have forsaken the <i>Duchess</i>, they have provoked the <i>fabulosa</i> <i>una</i> of Israel unto <i>wild</i>, they are <i>trolled</i> away backward.
    </li>
    <li>Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole <i>eke</i> is sick, and the whole <i>thumping cheat</i> faint.
    </li>
    <li>From the sole of the <i>plate</i> even unto the <i>eke</i> there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, <i>nishta</i> bound up, <i>nishta</i> mollified with ointment.
    </li>
    <li>Your country is desolate, your <i>smokes</i> are burned with <i>binco fakement</i>: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Zion is <i>dry</i> as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged <i>smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Except the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts had <i>dry</i> unto us a <i>dowry</i> <i>pogey</i> remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.
    </li>
    <li><i>Aunt nell</i> the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, ye rulers of Sodom; <i>parker</i> <i>aunt nelling cheat</i> unto the law of our <i>Gloria</i>, ye <i>homies and palones</i> of Gomorrah.
    </li>
    <li>To what purpose is the multitude of your <i>parkers</i> unto me? <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>: I am full of the burnt <i>parkerings</i> of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of <i>she</i> goats.
    </li>
    <li>When ye <i>troll</i> to appear before me, who hath required this at your <i>famble</i>, to <i>mince</i> my courts?
    </li>
    <li><i>Parker</i> <i>nishta</i> vain oblations; <i>smelly</i> is <i>a dowriest cod</i> unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is <i>codness</i>, even the solemn meeting.
    </li>
    <li>Your new moons and your appointed <i>dowry munjarlees</i> my <i>nishta lucoddy</i> hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am <i>a stretcher case</i> to bear them.
    </li>
    <li>And when ye spread forth your <i>fambles</i>, I will hide mine <i>ogles</i> from you: <i>any road up</i>, when ye make many <i>meshigener mutterings</i>, I will not <i>aunt nell</i>: your <i>fambles</i> are full of blood.
    </li>
    <li><i>Dhobie</i> you, make you clean; put away the <i>nana</i> of your doings from before mine <i>ogles</i>; cease to do <i>nana</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Learn to do well; <i>charper</i> judgment, relieve the oppressed, <i>beak</i> the fatherless, plead for the widow.
    </li>
    <li><i>Troll</i> now, and let us reason together, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>: though your <i>kertervers</i> be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
    </li>
    <li>If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall <i>jarry</i> the <i>bona</i> of the land:
    </li>
    <li>But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the <i>dowry efink</i>: for the <i>screech</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>cackled</i> it.
    </li>
    <li>How is the <i>fabulous</i> <i>smoke</i> become an <i>charvering donna</i>! it was full of judgment; <i>bonaness</i> lodged in it; but now murderers.
    </li>
    <li>Thy silver is become dross, thy <i>sherry</i> mixed with <i>aqua</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Thy <i>princesses</i> are rebellious, and companions of <i>sharpering homies</i>: every <i>una</i> loveth gifts, and followeth after <i>parkerings</i>: they <i>beak</i> not the fatherless, <i>nishta</i> doth the cause of the widow <i>troll</i> unto them.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts, the <i>dowry butch</i> <i>una</i> of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and <i>do the rights</i> me of mine enemies:
    </li>
    <li>And I will turn my <i>famble</i> upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and <i>lell</i> away all thy tin:
    </li>
    <li>And I will restore thy <i>beaks</i> as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be <i>screeched</i>, The <i>smoke</i> of <i>bonaness</i>, the <i>fabulous</i> <i>smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with <i>bonaness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the destruction of the transgressors and of the <i>kerterverers</i> shall be together, and they that forsake the <i>Duchess</i> shall be consumed.
    </li>
    <li>For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have <i>fancied</i>, and ye shall be <i>bamboozled</i> for the gardens that ye have chosen.
    </li>
    <li>For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no <i>aqua</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>butch</i> shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>The <i>lav</i> that Isaiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Amoz <i>vardad</i> concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i> shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.
    </li>
    <li>And many <i>homies and palones</i> shall <i>troll</i> and <i>cackle</i>, <i>troll</i> ye, and let us <i>troll</i> up to the mountain of the <i>Duchess</i>, to the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Gloria</i> of Jacob; and <i>she</i> will teach us of <i>her</i> ways, and we will <i>mince</i> in <i>her</i> paths: for out of Zion shall <i>troll forth</i> the law, and the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> from Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> shall <i>beak</i> among the nations, and shall rebuke many <i>homies and palones</i>: and they shall <i>zsa zsa-ed</i> their <i>dowry efinks</i> into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up <i>dowry efink</i> against nation, <i>nishta</i> shall they learn <i>barney</i> any more.
    </li>
    <li>O <i>lattie</i> of Jacob, <i>troll</i> ye, and let us <i>mince</i> in the <i>sparkle</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore thou hast forsaken thy <i>homies and palones</i> the <i>lattie</i> of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like the <i>naffs</i>, and they please themselves in the <i>chavvies</i> of strangers.
    </li>
    <li>Their land also is full of silver and <i>gelt</i>, <i>nishta</i> is there any end of their <i>gelt</i>; their land is also full of horses, <i>nishta</i> is there any end of their <i>rattling coves</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Their land also is full of idols; they worship the <i>acting dickey</i> of their own <i>fambles</i>, that which their own <i>luppers</i> have made:
    </li>
    <li>And the mean <i>homie</i> boweth down, and the <i>dowry</i> <i>homie</i> humbleth himself: therefore forgive them not.
    </li>
    <li>Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the <i>Duchess</i>, and for the <i>fabeness</i> of <i>her</i> <i>fabularity</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The lofty looks of <i>homie</i> shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of <i>homies</i> shall be bowed down, and the <i>Duchess</i> alone shall be exalted in that <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>journo</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts shall be upon every <i>una</i> that is proud and lofty, and upon every <i>una</i> that is lifted up; and <i>she</i> shall be brought low:
    </li>
    <li>And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,
    </li>
    <li>And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up,
    </li>
    <li>And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall,
    </li>
    <li>And upon all the <i>latties on water</i> of Tarshish, and upon all <i>dolly</i> pictures.
    </li>
    <li>And the loftiness of <i>homie</i> shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of <i>homies</i> shall be made low: and the <i>Duchess</i> alone shall be exalted in that <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the idols <i>she</i> shall utterly abolish.
    </li>
    <li>And they shall <i>troll</i> into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the <i>Duchess</i>, and for the <i>fabeness</i> of <i>her</i> <i>fabularity</i>, when <i>she</i> ariseth to shake terribly the earth.
    </li>
    <li>In that <i>journo</i> a <i>homie</i> shall cast <i>her</i> idols of silver, and <i>her</i> idols of <i>gelt</i>, which they made each <i>una</i> for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats;
    </li>
    <li>To <i>troll</i> into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the <i>Duchess</i>, and for the <i>fabeness</i> of <i>her</i> <i>fabularity</i>, when <i>she</i> ariseth to shake terribly the earth.
    </li>
    <li>Cease ye from <i>homie</i>, whose breath is in <i>her</i> <i>bugle</i>: for wherein is <i>she</i> to be accounted of ?
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>For, <i>varda</i>, the <i>Duchess</i>, the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts, doth <i>lell</i> away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the <i>trolling fakement</i>, the whole stay of <i>pannan</i>, and the whole stay of <i>aqua</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homie</i>, and the <i>homie</i> of <i>barney</i>, the <i>beak</i>, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,
    </li>
    <li>The captain of <i>chinker dacha</i>, and the honourable <i>homie</i>, and the counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.
    </li>
    <li>And I will <i>parker</i> <i>chavvies</i> to be their <i>princesses</i>, and babes shall rule over them.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>homies and palones</i> shall be oppressed, every <i>una</i> by another, and every <i>una</i> by <i>her</i> <i>homie ajax</i>: the <i>chavvie</i> shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable.
    </li>
    <li>When a <i>homie</i> shall <i>lell</i> hold of <i>her</i> <i>sister</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy <i>famble</i>:
    </li>
    <li>In that <i>journo</i> shall <i>she</i> swear, <i>cackling</i>, I will not be an healer; for in my <i>lattie</i> is <i>nishta</i> <i>pannan</i> <i>nishta</i> clothing: make me not a ruler of the <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their <i>polari</i> and their doings are against the <i>Duchess</i>, to provoke the <i>ogles</i> of <i>her</i> <i>fabeness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The shew of their countenance doth <i>varda-ing fakement</i> against them; and they <i>screech</i> their <i>kertever</i> as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their <i>nishta lucoddy</i>! for they have rewarded <i>nana</i> unto themselves.
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackle</i> ye to the <i>bona</i>, that it shall be well with <i>her</i>: for they shall <i>jarry</i> the fruit of their doings.
    </li>
    <li>Woe unto the <i>naff</i>! it shall be ill with <i>her</i>: for the <i>parkering</i> of <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i> shall be <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>As for my <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>chavvies</i> are their oppressors, and <i>palones</i> rule over them. O my <i>homies and palones</i>, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and <i>battyfang</i> the way of thy paths.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> standeth up to plead, and standeth to <i>beak</i> the <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> will enter into judgment with the ancients of <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, and the <i>princesses</i> thereof: for ye have <i>jarried</i> up the vineyard; the spoil of the <i>nanti dinarly</i> is in your <i>latties</i>.
    </li>
    <li>What mean ye that ye <i>zsa zsa-ed</i> my <i>homies and palones</i> to pieces, and grind the <i>ekes</i> of the <i>nanti dinarly</i>? <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of hosts.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackleth</i>, Because the <i>palone chavvies</i> of Zion are haughty, and <i>mince</i> with stretched forth necks and wanton <i>ogles</i>, <i>mincing</i> and mincing as they <i>troll</i>, and making a tinkling with their <i>plates</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Therefore the <i>Duchess</i> will <i>slap</i> with a scab the <i>mudge</i> of the <i>eke</i> of the <i>palone chavvies</i> of Zion, and the <i>Duchess</i> will discover their secret parts.
    </li>
    <li>In that <i>journo</i> the <i>Duchess</i> will <i>lell</i> away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their <i>plates</i>, and their cauls, and their round tires like the moon,
    </li>
    <li>The chains, and the <i>groinnage</i>, and the mufflers,
    </li>
    <li>The <i>mudges</i>, and the ornaments of the <i>scotches</i>, and the headbands, and the <i>doobs</i>, and the <i>aunt nelly fakes</i>,
    </li>
    <li>The <i>famble cheats</i>, and nose <i>groinage</i>,
    </li>
    <li>The changeable suits of <i>schmutter</i>, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins,
    </li>
    <li>The glasses, and the <i>bona</i> <i>lycra</i>, and the hoods, and the vails.
    </li>
    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, that instead of <i>bona</i> smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set <i>riah</i> <i>nanti riah</i>; and instead of a stomacher a girding of <i>nylon</i>; and burning instead of beauty.
    </li>
    <li>Thy <i>homies</i> shall fall by the <i>dowry efink</i>, and thy <i>dowry butch</i> in the <i>barney</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate shall <i>lett</i> upon the ground.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And in that <i>journo</i> <i>setter</i> <i>palones</i> shall <i>lell</i> hold of <i>una</i> <i>homie</i>, <i>cackling</i>, We will <i>jarry</i> our own <i>pannan</i>, and wear our own <i>schmutter</i>: only let us be <i>screeched</i> by thy name, to <i>lell</i> away our reproach.
    </li>
    <li>In that <i>journo</i> shall the branch of the <i>Duchess</i> be beautiful and <i>fabe</i>, and the fruit of the earth shall be <i>fantabulosa</i> and comely for them that are <i>scarpered</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, that <i>she</i> that is <i>dry</i> in Zion, and <i>she</i> that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be <i>screeched</i> <i>fabulosa</i>, even every <i>una</i> that is <i>screeved</i> among the living in Jerusalem:
    </li>
    <li>When the <i>Duchess</i> shall have <i>dhobied</i> away the filth of the <i>palone chavvies</i> of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the <i>Fairy</i> of judgment, and by the <i>Fairy</i> of burning.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> will create upon every <i>lattie</i> of mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by <i>journo</i>, and the shining of a flaming <i>binco fakement</i> by <i>nochy</i>: for upon all the <i>fabeness</i> shall be a defence.
    </li>
    <li>And there shall be a <i>bijou tabernaclette</i> for a shadow in the <i>journo</i> time from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now will I sing to my <i>heartface</i> a <i>chant</i> of my beloved <i>reefing</i> <i>her</i> vineyard. My <i>heartface</i> hath a vineyard in a <i>dowry</i> fruitful hill:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and <i>she</i> looked that it should <i>parker</i> forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.
    </li>
    <li>And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and <i>homies</i> of Judah, <i>beak</i>, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.
    </li>
    <li>What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should <i>parker</i> forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?
    </li>
    <li>And now <i>troll</i> to; I will <i>cackle</i> you what I will do to my vineyard: I will <i>lell</i> away the hedge thereof, and it shall be <i>jarried</i> up; and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be <i>minced</i> down:
    </li>
    <li>And I will <i>lett</i> it waste: it shall not be pruned, <i>nishta</i> digged; but there shall <i>troll</i> up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.
    </li>
    <li>For the vineyard of the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts is the <i>lattie</i> of Israel, and the <i>homies</i> of Judah <i>her</i> <i>dolly</i> plant: and <i>she</i> looked for judgment, but <i>varda</i> oppression; for <i>bonaness</i>, but <i>varda</i> a <i>screech</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Woe unto them that join <i>lattie</i> to <i>lattie</i>, that <i>lett</i> field to field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth!
    </li>
    <li>In mine <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> <i>cackled</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts, Of a truth many <i>latties</i> shall be desolate, even <i>dowry</i> and <i>filly</i>, <i>nanti</i> inhabitant.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, <i>dacha</i> acres of vineyard shall yield <i>una</i> bath, and the <i>maria</i> of an homer shall yield an ephah.
    </li>
    <li>Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may <i>troll after</i> <i>butch</i> <i>buvare</i>; that continue until <i>nochy</i>, till <i>sherry</i> inflame them!
    </li>
    <li>And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and <i>sherry</i>, are in their <i>dowry munjarlees</i>: but they regard not the <i>acting dickey</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>nishta</i> consider the operation of <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore my <i>homies and palones</i> are <i>trolled</i> into captivity, because they have no knowledge: and their honourable <i>homies</i> are famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her <i>screech</i> <i>nanti</i> measure: and their <i>fabeness</i>, and their multitude, and their pomp, and <i>she</i> that rejoiceth, shall <i>troll down</i> into it.
    </li>
    <li>And the mean <i>homie</i> shall be brought down, and the <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homie</i> shall be humbled, and the <i>ogles</i> of the lofty shall be humbled:
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and <i>Gloria</i> that is <i>fabulosa</i> shall be sanctified in <i>bonaness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers <i>jarry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Woe unto them that draw <i>codness</i> with cords of <i>spangly</i>, and <i>kertever</i> as it were with a cart rope:
    </li>
    <li>That <i>cackle</i>, Let <i>her</i> make speed, and hasten <i>her</i> <i>acting dickey</i>, that we may <i>varda</i> it: and let the counsel of the <i>fabulosa</i> <i>una</i> of Israel draw <i>ajax</i> and <i>troll</i>, that we may know it!
    </li>
    <li>Woe unto them that <i>screech</i> <i>nana</i> <i>bona</i>, and <i>bona</i> <i>nana</i>; that put <i>munge</i> for <i>sparkle</i>, and <i>sparkle</i> for <i>munge</i>; that put bitter for <i>bona</i>, and <i>bona</i> for bitter!
    </li>
    <li>Woe unto them that are wise in their own <i>ogles</i>, and prudent in their own <i>vardaing</i>!
    </li>
    <li>Woe unto them that are <i>dowry butch</i> to <i>buvare</i> <i>sherry</i>, and <i>homies</i> of <i>butchness</i> to mingle <i>butch</i> <i>buvare</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Which justify the <i>naff</i> for <i>parkering</i>, and <i>lell</i> away the <i>bonaness</i> of the <i>bona</i> from <i>her</i>!
    </li>
    <li>Therefore as the <i>binco fakement</i> devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall <i>troll</i> up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts, and despised the <i>lav</i> of the <i>fabulosa</i> <i>una</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore is the <i>wild</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> kindled against <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, and <i>she</i> hath stretched forth <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> against them, and hath smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcases were torn in the midst of the streets. For all this <i>her</i> <i>wild</i> is not turned away, but <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> is stretched out still.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, <i>varda</i>, they shall <i>troll</i> with speed swiftly:
    </li>
    <li>None shall be <i>a stretcher case</i> <i>nishta</i> stumble among them; none shall slumber <i>nishta</i> <i>letty</i>; <i>nishta</i> shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, <i>nishta</i> the latchet of their <i>slingbacks</i> be broken:
    </li>
    <li>Whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses&#8217; hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind:
    </li>
    <li>Their <i>butch shrieking</i> shall be like a lion, they shall <i>butch shriek</i> like <i>bean</i> lions: <i>any road up</i>, they shall <i>butch shriek</i>, and <i>lett</i> hold of the prey, and shall carry it away safe, and none shall deliver it.
    </li>
    <li>And in that <i>journo</i> they shall <i>butch shriek</i> against them like the <i>butch shrieking</i> of the sea: and if <i>una</i> <i>varda</i> unto the land, <i>varda</i> <i>munge</i> and <i>sharda</i>, and the <i>sparkle</i> is <i>munged</i> in the heavens thereof.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>In the year that <i>dowriest homie</i> Uzziah <i>carked it</i> I <i>vardad</i> also the <i>Duchess</i> sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and <i>her</i> train filled the <i>holy carsey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Above it stood the seraphims: each <i>una</i> had <i>sey</i> wings; with twain <i>she</i> covered <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>, and with twain <i>she</i> covered <i>her</i> <i>plates</i>, and with twain <i>she</i> did fly.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>una</i> <i>screeched</i> unto another, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>fabulosa</i>, <i>fabulosa</i>, <i>fabulosa</i>, is the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts: the whole earth is full of <i>her</i> <i>fabeness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the posts of the door <i>trolled</i> at the <i>cackling fakement</i> of <i>her</i> that <i>screeched</i>, and the <i>lattie</i> was filled with smoke.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a <i>homie</i> of <i>nanti sparkle</i> lips, and I <i>lett</i> in the midst of a <i>homies and palones</i> of <i>nanti sparkle</i> lips: for mine <i>ogles</i> have <i>vardad</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>, the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts.
    </li>
    <li>Then flew <i>una</i> of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>, which <i>she</i> had <i>lelled</i> with the tongs from off the <i>grovelling fakement</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> it upon my <i>screech</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Lo, this hath <i>reefed</i> thy lips; and thine <i>codness</i> is <i>lelled</i> away, and thy <i>kertever</i> purged.
    </li>
    <li>Also I <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>cackling fakement</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Whom shall I <i>lau</i>, and who will <i>troll</i> for us? Then <i>cackled</i> I, Here am I; <i>lau</i> me.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>troll</i>, and <i>cackle</i> this <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>aunt nell</i> ye indeed, but understand not; and <i>varda</i> ye indeed, but perceive not.
    </li>
    <li>Make the <i>thumping cheat</i> of this <i>homies and palones</i> fat, and make their <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> heavy, and shut their <i>ogles</i>; lest they <i>varda</i> with their <i>ogles</i>, and <i>aunt nell</i> with their <i>aunt nelly cheats</i>, and understand with their <i>thumping cheat</i>, and convert, and be healed.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> I, <i>Duchess</i>, how long? And <i>she</i> answered, Until the <i>smokes</i> be wasted <i>nanti</i> inhabitant, and the <i>latties</i> <i>nanti</i> <i>homie</i>, and the land be utterly desolate,
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> have removed <i>homies</i> far away, and there be a <i>dowry</i> forsaking in the midst of the land.
    </li>
    <li>But yet in it shall be a <i>dachath</i>, and it shall return, and shall be <i>jarried</i>: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the <i>fabulosa</i> <i>maria</i> shall be the substance thereof.

    </li>
    <li>And it was <i>cackled</i> the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Davina</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> was <i>trolled</i>, and the <i>thumping cheat</i> of <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, as the trees of the wood are <i>trolled</i> with the wind.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> the <i>Duchess</i> unto Isaiah, <i>troll forth</i> now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shearjashub thy <i>homie chavvie</i>, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller&#8217;s field;

    <li>And <i>cackle</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>lell</i> heed, and be quiet; fear not, <i>nishta</i> be fainthearted for the <i>dewey</i> tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce <i>wild</i> of Rezin with Syria, and of the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Remaliah.
    </li>
    <li>Because Syria, Ephraim, and the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Remaliah, have <i>lelled</i> <i>nana</i> counsel against thee, <i>cackling</i>,

    <li>Let us <i>troll</i> up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a <i>dowriest homie</i> in the midst of it, even the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Tabeal:

    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>, It shall not stand, <i>nishta</i> shall it <i>troll</i> to pass.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>eke</i> of Syria is Damascus, and the <i>eke</i> of Damascus is Rezin; and within <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> and <i>chinker</i> years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>eke</i> of Ephraim is Samaria, and the <i>eke</i> of Samaria is Remaliah&#8217;s <i>homie chavvie</i>. If ye will not believe, surely <i>nanti</i> be established.

    <li>Moreover the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> again unto Ahaz, <i>cackling</i>,

    <li>Ask thee a sign of the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i>; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.

    <li>But Ahaz <i>cackled</i>, I will not ask, <i>nishta</i> will I tempt the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>aunt nell</i> ye now, O <i>lattie</i> of <i>Davina</i>; Is it a <i>pogey</i> <i>fakement</i> for you to <i>a stretcher case</i> <i>homies</i>, but will ye <i>a stretcher case</i> my <i>Gloria</i> also?

    <li>Therefore the <i>Duchess</i> himself shall <i>parker</i> you a sign; <i>varda</i>, a <i>nanti charver</i> shall conceive, and bear a <i>homie chavvie</i>, and shall <i>screech</i> <i>her</i> name Immanuel.

    <li>Butter and honey shall <i>she</i> <i>jarry</i>, that <i>she</i> may know to refuse the <i>nana</i>, and choose the <i>bona</i>.

    <li>For before the <i>chavvie</i> shall know to refuse the <i>nana</i>, and choose the <i>bona</i>, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her <i>dowriest homies</i>.

    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> shall <i>parker</i> upon thee, and upon thy <i>homies and palones</i>, and upon thy <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, days that have not <i>troll</i>, from the <i>journo</i> that Ephraim <i>trolled off</i> from Judah; even the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria.
    </li>
    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass in that <i>journo</i>, that the <i>Duchess</i> shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.

    <li>And they shall <i>troll</i>, and shall <i>lettie</i> all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes.

    <li>In the same <i>journo</i> shall the <i>Duchess</i> <i>fatcha</i> with a <i>fatcha fakement</i> that is hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria, the <i>eke</i>, and the <i>riah</i> of the <i>plates</i>: and it shall also consume the beard.
    </li>
    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass in that <i>journo</i>, that a <i>homie</i> shall nourish a <i>bean</i> cow, and <i>dewey</i> sheep;
    </li>
    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, for the abundance of milk that they shall <i>parker</i> <i>she</i> shall <i>jarry</i> butter: for butter and honey shall every <i>una</i> <i>jarry</i> that is <i>dry</i> in the land.
    </li>
    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass in that <i>journo</i>, that every place shall be, where there were a <i>mille</i> vines at a <i>mille</i> silverlings, it shall even be for briers and thorns.
    </li>
    <li>With arrows and with bows shall <i>homies</i> <i>troll</i> thither; because all the land shall become briers and thorns.
    </li>
    <li>And on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there shall not <i>troll</i> thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of <i>nanti dowrier</i> cattle.

    <li>For before the <i>chavvie</i> shall have knowledge to <i>screech</i>, My <i>Auntie</i>, and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be <i>lelled</i> away before the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria.

    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> also unto me again, <i>cackling</i>,

    <li><i>Lell</i> counsel together, and it shall <i>troll</i> to nought; <i>cackle</i> the <i>lav</i>, and it shall not stand: for <i>Gloria</i> is with us.

    <li>For the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> thus to me with a <i>butch</i> <i>famble</i>, and instructed me that I should not <i>mince</i> in the way of this <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>cackling</i>,

    <li><i>Bonafy</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts himself; and let <i>her</i> be your fear, and let <i>her</i> be your dread.

    <li>And <i>she</i> shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the <i>latties</i> of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

    <li>And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be <i>lelled</i>.

    <li>Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.

    <li>And I will wait upon the <i>Duchess</i>, that hideth <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> from the <i>lattie</i> of Jacob, and I will <i>varda</i> for <i>her</i>.

    <li><i>Varda</i>, I and the <i>chavvies</i> whom the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>parkered</i> me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts, which <i>letteth</i> in mount Zion.

    <li>And when they shall <i>cackle</i> unto you, <i>charper</i> unto them that have familiar <i>fairies</i>, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a <i>homies and palones</i> <i>charper</i> unto their <i>Gloria</i>? for the living to the <i>stiff</i>?

    <li>To the law and to the testimony: if they <i>cackle</i> not according to this <i>lav</i>, it is because there is no <i>sparkle</i> in them.
    </li>
    <li>And they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their <i>dowriest homie</i> and their <i>Gloria</i>, and <i>varda</i> upward.
    </li>
    <li>And they shall <i>varda</i> unto the earth; and <i>varda</i> trouble and <i>munge</i>, dimness of anguish; and they shall be driven to <i>munge</i>.

    </li>
    <li>The <i>homies and palones</i> that <i>minced</i> in <i>munge</i> have <i>vardad</i> a <i>dowry</i> <i>sparkle</i>: they that <i>lett</i> in the land of the shadow of <i>carking it</i>, upon them hath the <i>sparkle</i> shined.

    <li>Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy: they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as <i>homies</i> rejoice when they divide the spoil.

    <li>For thou hast broken the yoke of <i>her</i> burden, and the <i>trolling fakement</i> of <i>her</i> shoulder, the rod of <i>her</i> oppressor, as in the <i>journo</i> of Midian.

    <li>For every battle of the warrior is with confused <i>screech</i>, and <i>frocks</i> rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of <i>binco fakement</i>.

    <li>Of the increase of <i>her</i> government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of <i>Davina</i>, and upon <i>her</i> kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts will perform this.

    <li>The burden of Egypt. <i>Varda</i>, the <i>Duchess</i> rideth upon a swift cloud, and shall <i>troll</i> into Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall be <i>trolled</i> at <i>her</i> presence, and the <i>thumping cheat</i> of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it.
    </li>
    <li>And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they shall <i>palaver</i> every <i>una</i> against <i>her</i> <i>sister</i>, and every <i>una</i> against <i>her</i> <i>homie ajax</i>; <i>smoke</i> against <i>smoke</i>, and kingdom against kingdom.

    <li>And the <i>Fairy</i> of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof; and I will <i>battyfang</i> the counsel thereof: and they shall <i>charper</i> to the idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar <i>fairies</i>, and to the wizards.
    </li>
    <li>And the Egyptians will I <i>parker</i> over into the <i>famble</i> of a cruel <i>Duchess</i>; and a fierce <i>dowriest homie</i> shall rule over them, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>aquas</i> shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and dried up.
    </li>
    <li>And they shall turn the rivers far away; and the brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried up: the reeds and flags shall wither.
    </li>
    <li>The paper reeds by the brooks, by the <i>screech</i> of the brooks, and every <i>fakement</i> sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away, and be <i>nishta</i>.

    <li>And they shall be broken in the purposes thereof, all that make sluices and ponds for fish.
    </li>
    <li>Surely the <i>princesses</i> of Zoan are fools, the counsel of the wise counsellors of Pharaoh is become brutish: how <i>cackle</i> ye unto Pharaoh, I am the <i>homie chavvie</i> of the wise, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of ancient <i>dowriest homies</i>?

    <li>Where are they? where are thy wise <i>homies</i>? and let them <i>cackle</i> thee now, and let them know what the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts hath purposed upon Egypt.

    <li>The <i>princesses</i> of Zoan are become fools, the <i>princesses</i> of Noph are <i>mogued</i>; they have also seduced Egypt, even they that are the stay of the tribes thereof.

    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> hath mingled a perverse <i>Fairy</i> in the midst thereof: and they have caused Egypt to err in every <i>acting dickey</i> thereof, as a <i>daffy</i> <i>homie</i> staggereth in <i>her</i> vomit.

    <li><i>Nishta</i> shall there be any <i>acting dickey</i> for Egypt, which the <i>eke</i> or tail, branch or rush, may do.

    <li>In that <i>journo</i> shall Egypt be like unto <i>palones</i>: and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shaking of the <i>famble</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts, which <i>she</i> shaketh over it.
    </li>
    <li>And the land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt, every <i>una</i> that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself, because of the counsel of the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts, which <i>she</i> hath determined against it.
    </li>
    <li>In that <i>journo</i> shall <i>chinker</i> <i>smokes</i> in the land of Egypt <i>cackle</i> the language of Canaan, and swear to the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts; <i>una</i> shall be <i>screeched</i>, The <i>smoke</i> of destruction.

    <li>In that <i>journo</i> shall there be an <i>grovelling fakement</i> to the <i>Duchess</i> in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the <i>Duchess</i>.

    <li>And it shall be for a sign and for a <i>varda-ing fakement</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts in the land of Egypt: for they shall <i>screech</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i> because of the oppressors, and <i>she</i> shall <i>lau</i> them a saviour, and a <i>dowry</i> <i>una</i>, and <i>she</i> shall deliver them.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know the <i>Duchess</i> in that <i>journo</i>, and shall do <i>parker</i> and oblation; <i>any road up</i>, they shall vow a vow unto the <i>Duchess</i>, and perform it.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> shall <i>slap</i> Egypt: <i>she</i> shall <i>slap</i> and heal it: and they shall return even to the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>she</i> shall be intreated of them, and shall heal them.

    <li>In that <i>journo</i> shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall <i>troll</i> into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians.

    <li>In that <i>journo</i> shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, even a <i>bona lav</i> in the midst of the land:

    <li>At the same time <i>cackled</i> the <i>Duchess</i> by Isaiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Amoz, <i>cackling</i>, <i>troll</i> and loose the <i>nylon</i> from off thy loins, and put off thy <i>slingback</i> from thy <i>plate</i>.

    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i>, Like as my <i>serving homie</i> Isaiah hath <i>minced</i> <i>nanti zhoosh</i> and barefoot <i>trey</i> years for a sign and wonder upon Egypt and upon Ethiopia;

    <li>So shall the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives, <i>bean</i> and <i>badge</i>, <i>nanti zhoosh</i> and barefoot, even with their buttocks uncovered, to the <i>scharda</i> of Egypt.

    <li>And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt their <i>fabeness</i>.

    <li>A <i>naff</i> vision is <i>screeched</i> unto me; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. <i>Troll</i> up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have <i>lelled</i> hold upon me, as the pangs of a <i>palone</i> that travaileth: I was bowed down at the hearing of it; I was dismayed at the <i>vardaing</i> of it.
    </li>
    <li>My <i>thumping cheat</i> panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the <i>nochy</i> of my pleasure hath <i>she</i> turned into fear unto me.

    <li>Prepare the table, <i>varda</i> in the watchtower, <i>jarry</i>, <i>buvare</i>: arise, ye <i>princesses</i>, and anoint the shield.
    </li>
    <li>For thus hath the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, <i>troll</i>, set a watchman, let <i>her</i> <i>screech</i> what <i>she</i> <i>vardaeth</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> a <i>trundling cheat</i> with a couple of horsemen, a <i>trundling cheat</i> of asses, and a <i>trundling cheat</i> of camels; and <i>she</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> diligently with <i>dowry</i> heed:

    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, here <i>trolleth</i> a <i>trundling cheat</i> of <i>homies</i>, with a couple of horsemen. And <i>she</i> answered and <i>cackled</i>, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods <i>she</i> hath broken unto the ground.
    </li>
    <li>O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have <i>aunt nelled</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts, the <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, have I <i>screeched</i> unto you.

    <li>The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye travelling companies of Dedanim.

    <li>The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought <i>aqua</i> to <i>her</i> that was thirsty, they prevented with their <i>pannan</i> <i>her</i> that fled.

    <li>All thy rulers are fled together, they are bound by the archers: all that are found in thee are bound together, which have fled from far.

    <li>Therefore <i>cackled</i> I, <i>varda</i> away from me; I will <i>parnie</i> bitterly, <i>acting dickey</i> not to comfort me, because of the spoiling of the <i>palone chavvie</i> of my <i>homies and palones</i>.

    <li>And Elam bare the quiver with <i>rattling coves</i> of <i>homies</i> and horsemen, and Kir uncovered the shield.

    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, that thy choicest valleys shall be full of <i>rattling coves</i>, and the horsemen shall set themselves in array at the gate.

    <li>Ye have <i>vardad</i> also the breaches of the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i>, that they are many: and ye gathered together the <i>aquas</i> of the lower pool.

    <li>And ye have numbered the <i>latties</i> of Jerusalem, and the <i>latties</i> have ye broken down to fortify the wall.

    <li>Ye made also a ditch between the <i>dewey</i> walls for the <i>aqua</i> of the <i>badge</i> pool: but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof, <i>nishta</i> had respect unto <i>her</i> that fashioned it long ago.

    <li><i>Varda</i>, the <i>Duchess</i> will carry thee away with a <i>dowry butch</i> captivity, and will surely cover thee.

    <li><i>She</i> will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a large country: there shalt thou <i>cark it</i>, and there the <i>rattling coves</i> of thy <i>fabeness</i> shall be the <i>scharda</i> of thy <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>.

    <li>And I will drive thee from thy station, and from thy state shall <i>she</i> pull thee down.

    <li><i>Duchess</i>, when thy <i>famble</i> is lifted up, they will not <i>varda</i>: but they shall <i>varda</i>, and be ashamed for their envy at the <i>homies and palones</i>; <i>any road up</i>, the <i>binco fakement</i> of thine enemies shall devour them.

    <li>O <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i>, other <i>ladies</i> beside thee have had dominion over us: but by thee only will we make mention of thy name.

    <li>They are <i>stiff</i>, they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and <i>battyfanged</i> them, and made all their memory to perish.

    <li>Thou hast increased the nation, O <i>Duchess</i>, thou hast increased the nation: thou art glorified: thou hadst removed it far unto all the ends of the earth.

    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, the <i>Duchess</i> hath a <i>dowry butch</i> and <i>butch</i> <i>una</i>, which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm, as a <i>dowry aqua</i> of <i>dowry butch</i> <i>aquas</i> overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>mudge</i> of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be <i>minced</i> under <i>plates</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>fabe</i> beauty, which is on the <i>eke</i> of the fat valley, shall be a fading flower, and as the hasty fruit before the summer; which when <i>she</i> that <i>varda-eth</i> upon it <i>vardaeth</i>, while it is yet in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> <i>she</i> eateth it up.
    </li>
    <li>In that <i>journo</i> shall the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts be for a <i>mudge</i> of <i>fabeness</i>, and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And for a <i>Fairy</i> of judgment to <i>her</i> that sitteth in judgment, and for <i>butchness</i> to them that turn the battle to the gate.
    </li>
    <li>But they also have erred through <i>sherry</i>, and through <i>butch</i> <i>buvare</i> are out of the way; the <i>godly homie</i> and the prophet have erred through <i>butch</i> <i>buvare</i>, they are <i>jarried</i> up of <i>sherry</i>, they are out of the way through <i>butch</i> <i>buvare</i>; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.
    </li>
    <li>For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is no place clean.
    </li>
    <li>Whom shall <i>she</i> teach knowledge? and whom shall <i>she</i> make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the <i>foofs</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a <i>bijou</i>, and there a <i>bijou</i>:
    </li>
    <li>For with stammering lips and another <i>polari</i> will <i>she</i> <i>cackle</i> to this <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>To whom <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, This is the <i>lettie</i> wherewith ye may cause the <i>a stretcher case</i> to <i>lettie</i>; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not <i>aunt nell</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> was unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a <i>bijou</i>, and there a <i>bijou</i>; that they might <i>troll</i>, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and <i>lelled</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore <i>aunt nell</i> the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, ye scornful <i>homies</i>, that rule this <i>homies and palones</i> which is in Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>Because ye have <i>cackled</i>, We have made a covenant with <i>carking it</i>, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not <i>troll</i> unto us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:

    <li>Therefore thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>, <i>varda</i>, I <i>lett</i> in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: <i>she</i> that believeth shall not make haste.

    <li>Judgment also will I <i>lett</i> to the line, and <i>bonaness</i> to the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the <i>aquas</i> shall overflow the hiding place.
    </li>
    <li>And your covenant with <i>carking it</i> shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be <i>minced</i> down by it.

    <li>From the time that it goeth forth it shall <i>lell</i> you: for morning by morning shall it <i>troll over</i>, by <i>journo</i> and by <i>nochy</i>: and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report.
    </li>
    <li>For the bed is shorter than that a <i>homie</i> can stretch himself on it: and the covering narrower than that <i>she</i> can wrap himself in it.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>Duchess</i> shall rise up as in mount Perazim, <i>she</i> shall be <i>dander</i> as in the valley of Gibeon, that <i>she</i> may do <i>her</i> <i>acting dickey</i>, <i>her</i> strange <i>acting dickey</i>; and <i>parker</i> to pass <i>her</i> act, <i>her</i> strange act.

    <li>When <i>she</i> hath made plain the <i>eke</i> thereof, doth <i>she</i> not cast abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rie in their place?
    </li>
    <li>For <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i> doth instruct <i>her</i> to discretion, and doth teach <i>her</i>.

    <li>For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument, <i>nishta</i> is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the fitches are beaten out with a <i>trolling fakement</i>, and the cummin with a rod.

    <li><i>Pannan</i> corn is bruised; because <i>she</i> will not ever be threshing it, <i>nishta</i> break it with the wheel of <i>her</i> cart, <i>nishta</i> bruise it with <i>her</i> horsemen.

    <li>For the <i>Duchess</i> hath poured out upon you the <i>Fairy</i> of deep <i>letty</i>, and hath closed your <i>ogles</i>: the prophets and your rulers, the seers hath <i>she</i> covered.
    </li>
    <li>And the vision of all is become unto you as the <i>lavs</i> of a <i>glossy</i> that is sealed, which <i>homies</i> deliver to <i>una</i> that is learned, <i>cackling</i>, <i>varda the lavs</i> this, I pray thee: and <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i>, I cannot; for it is sealed:

    <li>Surely your turning of <i>fakements</i> upside down shall be esteemed as the potter&#8217;s clay: for shall the <i>acting dickey</i> <i>cackle</i> of <i>her</i> that made it, <i>she</i> made me not? or shall the <i>fakement</i> framed <i>cackle</i> of <i>her</i> that framed it, <i>she</i> had no understanding?
    </li>
    <li>Is it not yet a <i>dowry</i> <i>bijou</i> while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?

    <li>Then <i>trolled</i> Eliakim, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with their <i>zhoosh</i> rent, and <i>cackled</i> <i>her</i> the <i>lavs</i> of Rabshakeh.

    <h2>Chapter 37</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when <i>dowriest homie</i> Hezekiah <i>aunt nelled</i> it, that <i>she</i> rent <i>her</i> <i>zhoosh</i>, and covered himself with <i>nylon</i>, and <i>trolled</i> into the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the <i>fungi</i> of the <i>godly homies</i> covered with <i>nylon</i>, unto Isaiah the prophet the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Amoz.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> Hezekiah, This <i>journo</i> is a <i>journo</i> of trouble, and of rebuke, and of <i>billingsgate</i>: for the <i>chavvies</i> are <i>troll</i> to the birth, and there is not <i>butchness</i> to <i>parker</i> forth.
    </li>
    <li>It may be the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> will <i>aunt nell</i> the <i>lavs</i> of Rabshakeh, whom the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria <i>her</i> master hath <i>laued</i> to reproach the living <i>Gloria</i>, and will reprove the <i>lavs</i> which the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>aunt nelled</i>: wherefore lift up thy <i>meshigener muttering</i> for the remnant that is <i>dry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So the <i>serving homies</i> of <i>dowriest homie</i> Hezekiah <i>trolled</i> to Isaiah.
    </li>
    <li>And Isaiah <i>cackled</i> unto them, Thus shall ye <i>cackle</i> unto your master, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, Be not afraid of the <i>lavs</i> that thou hast <i>aunt nelled</i>, wherewith the <i>serving homies</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria have blasphemed me.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, I will <i>lau</i> a blast upon <i>her</i>, and <i>she</i> shall <i>aunt nell</i> a <i>gossip</i>, and <i>troll back to</i> <i>her</i> own land; and I will cause <i>her</i> to fall by the <i>dowry efink</i> in <i>her</i> own land.
    </li>
    <li>So Rabshakeh <i>trolled back</i>, and found the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria warring against Libnah: for <i>she</i> had <i>aunt nelled</i> that <i>she</i> was <i>trolled off</i> from Lachish.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> <i>cackle</i> concerning Tirhakah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Ethiopia, <i>she</i> is <i>troll</i> forth to make <i>barney</i> with thee. And when <i>she</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> it, <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> messengers to Hezekiah, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Thus shall ye <i>cackle</i> to Hezekiah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, <i>cackling</i>, Let not thy <i>Gloria</i>, in whom thou trustest, <i>mogue</i> thee, <i>cackling</i>, Jerusalem shall not be <i>parkered</i> into the <i>famble</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, thou hast <i>aunt nelled</i> what the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be <i>laued</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Have the gods of the nations <i>laued</i> them which my <i>aunties</i> have <i>battyfanged</i>, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the <i>chavvies</i> of Eden which were in Telassar?
    </li>
    <li>Where is the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Hamath, and the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Arphad, and the <i>dowriest homie</i> of the <i>smoke</i> of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?
    </li>
    <li>And Hezekiah <i>lalled</i> the letter from the <i>famble</i> of the messengers, and <i>varda the lavs</i> it: and Hezekiah <i>trolled</i> up unto the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and spread it before the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Hezekiah prayed unto the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>O <i>Duchess</i> of hosts, <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, that dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the <i>Gloria</i>, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth.
    </li>
    <li>Incline thine <i>aunt nelling cheat</i>, O <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>aunt nell</i>; open thine <i>ogles</i>, O <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>varda</i>: and <i>aunt nell</i> all the <i>lavs</i> of Sennacherib, which hath <i>laued</i> to reproach the living <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Of a truth, <i>Duchess</i>, the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Assyria have <i>laued</i> waste all the nations, and their countries,
    </li>
    <li>And have cast their gods into the <i>binco fakement</i>: for they were no gods, but the <i>acting dickey</i> of <i>homies</i>&#8216;s <i>fambles</i>, wood and stone: therefore they have <i>battyfanged</i> them.
    </li>
    <li>Now therefore, O <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i>, save us from <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the <i>Duchess</i>, even thou only.
    </li>
    <li>Then Isaiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Amoz <i>laued</i> unto Hezekiah, <i>cackling</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria:
    </li>
    <li>This is the <i>lav</i> which the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>cackled</i> concerning <i>her</i>; The <i>nanti charver</i>, the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Zion, hath despised thee, and <i>tittered</i> thee to scorn; the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Jerusalem hath shaken her <i>eke</i> at thee.
    </li>
    <li>Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy <i>cackling fakement</i>, and lifted up thine <i>ogles</i> on high? even against the <i>fabulosa</i> <i>una</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>By thy <i>serving homies</i> hast thou reproached the <i>Duchess</i>, and hast <i>cackled</i>, By the multitude of my <i>rattling coves</i> am I <i>troll</i> up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the height of <i>her</i> border, and the forest of <i>her</i> Carmel.
    </li>
    <li>I have digged, and <i>bevvied</i> <i>aqua</i>; and with the sole of my <i>plates</i> have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.
    </li>
    <li>Hast thou not <i>aunt nelled</i> long ago, how I have done it; and of ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to <i>lett</i> waste defenced <i>smokes</i> into ruinous heaps.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore their inhabitants were of <i>pogey</i> power, they were dismayed and <i>bamboozled</i>: they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up.
    </li>
    <li>But I know thy <i>letted</i>, and thy going out, and thy <i>trolling</i> in, and thy rage against me.
    </li>
    <li>Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is <i>troll</i> up into mine <i>aunt nelly cheats</i>, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.
    </li>
    <li>And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall <i>jarry</i> this year such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and <i>jarry</i> the fruit thereof.
    </li>
    <li>And the remnant that is <i>scarpered</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of Judah shall again <i>lell</i> root downward, and bear fruit upward:
    </li>
    <li>For out of Jerusalem shall <i>troll forth</i> a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts shall do this.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> concerning the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria, <i>she</i> shall not <i>troll</i> into this <i>smoke</i>, <i>nishta</i> shoot an arrow there, <i>nishta</i> <i>troll</i> before it with shields, <i>nishta</i> cast a bank against it.
    </li>
    <li>By the way that <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i>, by the same shall <i>she</i> return, and shall not <i>troll</i> into this <i>smoke</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For I will defend this <i>smoke</i> to save it for mine own sake, and for my <i>serving homie</i> <i>Davina</i>&#8216;s sake.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> forth, and <i>slapped</i> in the camp of the Assyrians a <i>chenter</i> and fourscore and <i>chinker</i> <i>mille</i>: and when they arose early in the morning, <i>varda</i>, they were all <i>stiff</i> corpses.
    </li>
    <li>So Sennacherib <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria <i>trolled off</i>, and <i>trolled</i> and <i>trolled back</i>, and <i>letted</i> at Nineveh.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, as <i>she</i> was worshipping in the <i>lattie</i> of Nisroch <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i>, that Adrammelech and Sharezer <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> <i>slapped</i> <i>her</i> with the <i>dowry efink</i>; and they <i>scarpered</i> into the land of Armenia: and Esarhaddon <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> reigned in <i>her</i> stead.

    <h2>Chapter 38</h2>

    <li>In those days was Hezekiah sick unto <i>carking it</i>.

    </li>
    <li>Then Hezekiah turned <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> toward the wall, and prayed unto the <i>Duchess</i>,

    <li>And <i>cackled</i>, Remember now, O <i>Duchess</i>, I beseech thee, how I have <i>minced</i> before thee <i>no flies</i> and with a <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>, and have done that which is <i>bona</i> in thy <i>vardaing</i>. And Hezekiah <i>parnied</i> sore.

    <li>Then <i>trolled</i> the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> to Isaiah, <i>cackling</i>,

    <li><i>Troll</i>, and <i>cackle</i> to Hezekiah, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, the <i>Gloria</i> of <i>Davina</i> thy <i>Auntie</i>, I have <i>aunt nelled</i> thy <i>meshigener muttering</i>, I have <i>vardad</i> thy tears: <i>varda</i>, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.

    <li>And I will deliver thee and this <i>smoke</i> out of the <i>famble</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria: and I will defend this <i>smoke</i>.

    <li>And this shall be a sign unto thee from the <i>Duchess</i>, that the <i>Duchess</i> will do this <i>fakement</i> that <i>she</i> hath <i>cackled</i>;
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, I will <i>parker</i> again the shadow of the degrees, which is <i>trolled</i> down in the sun dial of Ahaz, <i>dacha</i> degrees backward. So the sun <i>trolled back</i> <i>dacha</i> degrees, by which degrees it was <i>trolled</i> down.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>screeving</i> of Hezekiah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, when <i>she</i> had been sick, and was recovered of <i>her</i> <i>kerterver coddy</i>:
    </li>
    <li>I <i>cackled</i> in the cutting off of my days, I shall <i>troll</i> to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years.
    </li>
    <li>I <i>cackled</i>, I shall not <i>varda</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, even the <i>Duchess</i>, in the land of the living: I shall <i>varda</i> <i>homie</i> <i>nishta</i> with the inhabitants of the world.
    </li>
    <li>Mine age is <i>trolled off</i>, and is removed from me as a shepherd&#8217;s <i>trolling lettie</i>: I have cut off like a weaver my life: <i>she</i> will cut me off with pining <i>kerterver coddy</i>: from <i>journo</i> even to <i>nochy</i> wilt thou make an end of me.
    </li>
    <li>I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will <i>she</i> break all my bones: from <i>journo</i> even to <i>nochy</i> wilt thou make an end of me.
    </li>
    <li>Like a crane or a <i>jarry</i>, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove: mine <i>ogles</i> fail with looking upward: O <i>Duchess</i>, I am oppressed; undertake for me.
    </li>
    <li>What shall I <i>cackle</i>? <i>she</i> hath both <i>cackled</i> unto me, and himself hath done it: I shall <i>troll</i> softly all my years in the bitterness of my <i>nishta lucoddy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>O <i>Duchess</i>, by these <i>fakements</i> <i>homies</i> live, and in all these <i>fakements</i> is the life of my <i>Fairy</i>: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, for peace I had <i>dowry</i> bitterness: but thou hast in love to my <i>nishta lucoddy</i> <i>laued</i> it from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast all my <i>kertervers</i> behind thy back.
    </li>
    <li>For the grave cannot praise thee, <i>carking it</i> can not celebrate thee: they that <i>troll</i> down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.
    </li>
    <li>The living, the living, <i>she</i> shall praise thee, as I do this <i>journo</i>: the <i>Auntie</i> to the <i>chavvies</i> shall make known thy truth.

    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> was ready to save me: therefore we will sing my <i>chants</i> to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.

    <li>For Isaiah had <i>cackled</i>, Let them <i>lell</i> a lump of figs, and <i>lett</i> it for a plaister upon the boil, and <i>she</i> shall recover.

    <li>Hezekiah also had <i>cackled</i>, What is the sign that I shall <i>troll</i> up to the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>?

    </li>
    <li>And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the <i>lattie</i> of <i>her</i> precious <i>fakements</i>, the silver, and the <i>gelt</i>, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the <i>lattie</i> of <i>her</i> armour, and all that was found in <i>her</i> <i>gelt</i>: there was <i>nishter</i> in <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>, <i>nishta</i> in all <i>her</i> dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>trolled</i> Isaiah the prophet unto <i>dowriest homie</i> Hezekiah, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, What <i>cackled</i> these <i>homies</i>? and from whence <i>trolled</i> they unto thee? And Hezekiah <i>cackled</i>, They are <i>troll</i> from a far country unto me, even from Babylon.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i>, What have they <i>vardad</i> in thine <i>lattie</i>? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in mine <i>lattie</i> have they <i>vardad</i>: there is <i>nishter</i> among my <i>gelt</i> that I have not shewed them.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> Isaiah to Hezekiah, <i>aunt nell</i> the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts:

    <li><i>Varda</i>, the days <i>troll</i>, that all that is in thine <i>lattie</i>, and that which thy <i>aunties</i> have <i>laued</i> up in store until this <i>journo</i>, shall be <i>lelled</i> to Babylon: <i>nishter</i> shall be <i>dry</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.

    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> Hezekiah to Isaiah, <i>bona</i> is the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> which thou hast <i>cackled</i>. <i>She</i> <i>cackled</i> moreover, For there shall be peace and truth in my days.

    <li>Thou shalt <i>charper</i> them, and shalt not find them, even them that contended with thee: they that <i>barney</i> against thee shall be as <i>nishter</i>, and as a <i>fakement</i> of nought.

    <li>But <i>she</i> was wounded for our transgressions, <i>she</i> was bruised for our <i>cods</i>: the chastisement of our peace was upon <i>her</i>; and with <i>her</i> stripes we are healed.

    <li>And <i>she</i> made <i>her</i> grave with the <i>naff</i>, and with the rich in <i>her</i> <i>carking it</i>; because <i>she</i> had done no <i>slapping</i>, <i>nishta</i> was any deceit in <i>her</i> <i>screech</i>.

    <li>Yet it pleased the <i>Duchess</i> to bruise <i>her</i>; <i>she</i> hath put <i>her</i> to grief: when thou shalt make <i>her</i> <i>nishta lucoddy</i> an <i>parkering</i> for <i>kertever</i>, <i>she</i> shall <i>varda</i> <i>her</i> <i>maria</i>, <i>she</i> shall prolong <i>her</i> days, and the pleasure of the <i>Duchess</i> shall prosper in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>.

    <li>Wherefore have we fasted, <i>cackle</i> they, and thou <i>vardest</i> not? wherefore have we afflicted our <i>nishta lucoddy</i>, and thou takest no knowledge? <i>varda</i>, in the <i>journo</i> of your <i>nishta manjarry</i> ye find pleasure, and exact all your <i>acting dickeys</i>.

    <li>Is it such a <i>nishta manjarry</i> that I have chosen? a <i>journo</i> for a <i>homie</i> to afflict <i>her</i> <i>nishta lucoddy</i>? is it to bow down <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> as a bulrush, and to spread <i>nylon</i> and ashes under <i>her</i>? wilt thou <i>screech</i> this a <i>nishta manjarry</i>, and an acceptable <i>journo</i> to the <i>Duchess</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Is not this the <i>nishta manjarry</i> that I have chosen? to loose the bands of <i>naffness</i>, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed <i>troll</i> free, and that ye break every yoke?
    </li>
    <li>Is it not to deal thy <i>pannan</i> to the hungry, and that thou <i>parker</i> the <i>nanti dinarly</i> that are cast out to thy <i>lattie</i>? when thou <i>vardest</i> the <i>nanti zhoosh</i>, that thou cover <i>her</i>; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?

    <li>Then shall thy <i>sparkle</i> break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy <i>bonaness</i> shall <i>troll</i> before thee; the <i>fabeness</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> shall be thy rereward.

    <li>Then shalt thou <i>screech</i>, and the <i>Duchess</i> shall answer; thou shalt <i>screech</i>, and <i>she</i> shall <i>cackle</i>, Here I am. If thou <i>lell</i> away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the <i>lupper</i>, and speaking <i>spangly</i>;

    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy <i>nishta lucoddy</i> in <i>nishta parnie</i>, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of <i>aqua</i>, whose <i>aquas</i> fail not.
    </li>
    <li>And they that shall be of thee shall build the <i>badge</i> waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many <i>chavvies</i>; and thou shalt be <i>screeched</i>, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to <i>lett</i> in.
    </li>
    <li>If thou turn away thy <i>plate</i> from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my <i>fabulosa</i> <i>journo</i>; and <i>screech</i> the sabbath a delight, the <i>fabulosa</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, honourable; and shalt honour <i>her</i>, not doing thine own ways, <i>nishta</i> finding thine own pleasure, <i>nishta</i> speaking thine own <i>lavs</i>:

    <li>Then shalt thou delight thyself in the <i>Duchess</i>; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy <i>Auntie</i>: for the <i>screech</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>cackled</i> it.

    <h2>Chapter 59</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s <i>famble</i> is not shortened, that it cannot save; <i>nishta</i> <i>her</i> <i>aunt nelling cheat</i> heavy, that it cannot <i>aunt nell</i>:
    </li>
    <li>But your <i>cods</i> have separated between you and your <i>Gloria</i>, and your <i>kertervers</i> have hid <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> from you, that <i>she</i> will not <i>aunt nell</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For your <i>fambles</i> are defiled with blood, and your <i>luppers</i> with <i>codness</i>; your lips have <i>cackled</i> lies, your <i>polari</i> hath muttered perverseness.
    </li>
    <li>None <i>screecheth</i> for justice, <i>nishta</i> any pleadeth for truth: they trust in <i>spangly</i>, and <i>cackle</i> lies; they conceive mischief, and <i>parker</i> forth <i>codness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>They hatch cockatrice&#8217; eggs, and weave the spider&#8217;s web: <i>she</i> that eateth of their eggs <i>carketh it</i>, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper.
    </li>
    <li>Their webs shall not become <i>frocks</i>, <i>nishta</i> shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of <i>codness</i>, and the act of <i>slapping</i> is in their <i>fambles</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Their <i>plates</i> run to <i>nana</i>, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of <i>codness</i>; wasting and destruction are in their paths.
    </li>
    <li>The way of peace they know not; and there is no judgment in their goings: they have made them <i>bent</i> paths: whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore is judgment <i>nishter ajax</i> us, <i>nishta</i> doth justice overtake us: we wait for <i>sparkle</i>, but <i>varda</i> obscurity; for brightness, but we <i>mince</i> in <i>munge</i>.
    </li>
    <li>We grope for the wall like the <i>nanti varda</i>, and we grope as if we had no <i>ogles</i>: we stumble at noon <i>journo</i> as in the <i>nochy</i>; we are in desolate places as <i>stiff</i> <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>We <i>butch shriek</i> all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we <i>varda</i> for judgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.
    </li>
    <li>For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our <i>kertervers</i> testify against us: for our transgressions are with us; and as for our <i>cods</i>, we know them;
    </li>
    <li>In transgressing and lying against the <i>Duchess</i>, and departing away from our <i>Gloria</i>, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the <i>thumping cheat</i> <i>lavs</i> of falsehood.
    </li>
    <li>And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth <i>nishta ajax</i> off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, truth faileth; and <i>she</i> that departeth from <i>nana</i> maketh himself a prey: and the <i>Duchess</i> <i>vardad</i> it, and it displeased <i>her</i> that there was no judgment.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> that there was no <i>homie</i>, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore <i>her</i> arm brought salvation unto <i>her</i>; and <i>her</i> <i>bonaness</i>, it sustained <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> put on <i>bonaness</i> as a <i>basque</i>, and an helmet of salvation upon <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>; and <i>she</i> put on the <i>frocks</i> of <i>the rights</i> for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a <i>kapello</i>.
    </li>
    <li>According to their deeds, accordingly <i>she</i> will repay, fury to <i>her</i> adversaries, recompence to <i>her</i> enemies; to the islands <i>she</i> will repay recompence.
    </li>
    <li>So shall they fear the name of the <i>Duchess</i> from the west, and <i>her</i> <i>fabeness</i> from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall <i>troll</i> in like a <i>dowry aqua</i>, the <i>Fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> shall lift up a standard against <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the Redeemer shall <i>troll</i> to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>As for me, this is my covenant with them, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>; My <i>Fairy</i> that is upon thee, and my <i>lavs</i> which I have put in thy <i>screech</i>, shall not <i>troll off</i> out of thy <i>screech</i>, <i>nishta</i> out of the <i>screech</i> of thy <i>maria</i>, <i>nishta</i> out of the <i>screech</i> of thy <i>maria</i>&#8216;s <i>maria</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, from henceforth and for ever.

    <li>Thy <i>fabulosa</i> <i>smokes</i> are a <i>nishta smoke</i>, Zion is a <i>nishta smoke</i>, Jerusalem a desolation.
    </li>
    <li>Our <i>fabulosa</i> and our beautiful <i>lattie</i>, where our <i>aunties</i> praised thee, is burned up with <i>binco fakement</i>: and all our <i>dolly</i> <i>fakements</i> are <i>laued</i> waste.
    </li>
    <li>Wilt thou refrain thyself for these <i>fakements</i>, O <i>Duchess</i>? wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us <i>dowry</i> sore?
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 65</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i> me, <i>varda</i> me, unto a nation that was not <i>screeched</i> by my name.
    </li>
    <li>I have spread out my <i>fambles</i> all the <i>journo</i> unto a rebellious <i>homies and palones</i>, which <i>minceth</i> in a way that was not <i>bona</i>, after their own thoughts;
    </li>
    <li>A <i>homies and palones</i> that provoketh me to <i>wild</i> continually to my <i>eke</i>; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth <i>smelly</i> upon altars of brick;
    </li>
    <li>Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which <i>jarry</i> swine&#8217;s flesh, and broth of abominable <i>fakements</i> is in their <i>fakements</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Which <i>cackle</i>, Stand by thyself, <i>troll</i> not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a <i>binco fakement</i> that burneth all the <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, it is <i>screeved</i> before me: I will not keep <i>nishta cackle</i>, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,
    </li>
    <li>Your <i>cods</i>, and the <i>cods</i> of your <i>aunties</i> together, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, which have burned <i>smelly</i> upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former <i>acting dickey</i> into their bosom.
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, As the new <i>sherry</i> is found in the cluster, and <i>una</i> <i>cackleth</i>, <i>battyfang</i> it not; for a <i>bona lav</i> is in it: so will I do for my <i>serving homies</i>&#8216; sakes, that I may not <i>battyfang</i> them all.
    </li>
    <li>And I will <i>parker</i> forth a <i>maria</i> out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my <i>serving homies</i> shall <i>lett</i> there.
    </li>
    <li>And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my <i>homies and palones</i> that have sought me.
    </li>
    <li>But ye are they that forsake the <i>Duchess</i>, that forget my <i>fabulosa</i> mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the <i>buvare</i> <i>parkering</i> unto that number.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore will I number you to the <i>dowry efink</i>, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I <i>screeched</i>, ye did not answer; when I <i>cackled</i>, ye did not <i>aunt nell</i>; but did <i>nana</i> before mine <i>ogles</i>, and did choose that wherein I delighted not.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>, <i>varda</i>, my <i>serving homies</i> shall <i>jarry</i>, but ye shall be hungry: <i>varda</i>, my <i>serving homies</i> shall <i>buvare</i>, but ye shall be thirsty: <i>varda</i>, my <i>serving homies</i> shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, my <i>serving homies</i> shall sing for joy of <i>thumping cheat</i>, but ye shall <i>screech</i> for <i>sharda</i> of <i>thumping cheat</i>, and shall howl for vexation of <i>Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> shall <i>ferricadooza</i> thee, and <i>screech</i> <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i> by another name:
    </li>
    <li>That <i>she</i> who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the <i>Gloria</i> of truth; and <i>she</i> that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the <i>Gloria</i> of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine <i>ogles</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For, <i>varda</i>, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, <i>nishta</i> <i>troll</i> into mind.
    </li>
    <li>But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for, <i>varda</i>, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her <i>homies and palones</i> a joy.
    </li>
    <li>And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my <i>homies and palones</i>: and the <i>cackling fakement</i> of weeping shall be <i>nishta</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> in her, <i>nishta</i> the <i>cackling fakement</i> of <i>screeching</i>.
    </li>
    <li>There shall be <i>nishta</i> thence an <i>lullaby cheat</i> of days, <i>nishta</i> an <i>badge cove</i> that hath not filled <i>her</i> days: for the <i>chavvie</i> shall <i>cark it</i> an <i>chenter</i> years <i>badge</i>; but the sinner being an <i>chenter</i> years <i>badge</i> shall be accursed.
    </li>
    <li>And they shall build <i>latties</i>, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and <i>jarry</i> the fruit of them.
    </li>
    <li>They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another <i>jarry</i>: for as the days of a tree are the days of my <i>homies and palones</i>, and mine elect shall long enjoy the <i>acting dickey</i> of their <i>fambles</i>.
    </li>
    <li>They shall not <i>acting dickey</i> in vain, <i>nishta</i> <i>parker</i> forth for trouble; for they are the <i>maria</i> of the <i>fabed</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and their offspring with them.
    </li>
    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, that before they <i>screech</i>, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will <i>aunt nell</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall <i>jarry</i> straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent&#8217;s <i>carnish</i>. They shall not hurt <i>nishta</i> <i>battyfang</i> in all my <i>fabulosa</i> mountain, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 66</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the <i>lattie</i> that ye build unto me? and where is the place of my <i>lettie</i>?
    </li>
    <li>For all those <i>fakements</i> hath mine <i>famble</i> made, and all those <i>fakements</i> have been, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>: but to this <i>homie</i> will I <i>varda</i>, even to <i>her</i> that is <i>nanti dinarly</i> and of a contrite <i>Fairy</i>, and trembleth at my <i>lav</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> that <i>ferricadozaeth</i> an ox is as if <i>she</i> <i>ferricadoozaed</i> a <i>homie</i>; <i>she</i> that sacrificeth a lamb, as if <i>she</i> cut off a <i>girl with a lovely personality</i>&#8216;s neck; <i>she</i> that offereth an oblation, as if <i>she</i> offered swine&#8217;s blood; <i>she</i> that burneth <i>smelly</i>, as if <i>she</i> <i>fabed</i> an idol. <i>Any road up</i>, they have chosen their own ways, and their <i>nishta lucoddy</i> delighteth in their <i>dowry cods</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I also will choose their delusions, and will <i>parker</i> their fears upon them; because when I <i>screeched</i>, none did answer; when I <i>cackled</i>, they did not <i>aunt nell</i>: but they did <i>nana</i> before mine <i>ogles</i>, and chose that in which I delighted not.
    </li>
    <li><i>Aunt nell</i> the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, ye that tremble at <i>her</i> <i>lav</i>; Your <i>sisters</i> that hated you, that cast you out for my name&#8217;s sake, <i>cackled</i>, Let the <i>Duchess</i> be glorified: but <i>she</i> shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.
    </li>
    <li>A <i>cackling fakement</i> of <i>screech</i> from the <i>smoke</i>, a <i>cackling fakement</i> from the <i>holy carsey</i>, a <i>cackling fakement</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> that rendereth recompence to <i>her</i> enemies.
    </li>
    <li>Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain <i>trolled</i>, she was <i>laued</i> of a <i>homie</i> <i>chavvie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Who hath <i>aunt nelled</i> such a <i>fakement</i>? who hath <i>vardad</i> such <i>fakements</i>? Shall the earth be made to <i>parker</i> forth in <i>una</i> <i>journo</i>? or shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her <i>chavvies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Shall I <i>parker</i> to the birth, and not cause to <i>parker</i> forth? <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>: shall I cause to <i>parker</i> forth, and shut the womb? <i>cackleth</i> thy <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her:
    </li>
    <li>That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the <i>foofs</i> of her consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her <i>fabeness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>varda</i>, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the <i>fabeness</i> of the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> like a flowing stream: then shall ye suck, ye shall be borne upon her sides, and be dandled upon her knees.
    </li>
    <li>As <i>una</i> whom <i>her</i> mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And when ye <i>varda</i> this, your <i>thumping cheat</i> shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb: and the <i>famble</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> shall be known toward <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>, and <i>her</i> indignation toward <i>her</i> enemies.
    </li>
    <li>For, <i>varda</i>, the <i>Duchess</i> will <i>troll</i> with <i>binco fakement</i>, and with <i>her</i> <i>rattling coves</i> like a whirlwind, to render <i>her</i> <i>wild</i> with fury, and <i>her</i> rebuke with flames of <i>binco fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For by <i>binco fakement</i> and by <i>her</i> <i>dowry efink</i> will the <i>Duchess</i> plead with all flesh: and the <i>ferricadoozed</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> shall be many.
    </li>
    <li>They that <i>bonafy</i> themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind <i>una</i> tree in the midst, eating swine&#8217;s flesh, and the <i>dowry cod</i>, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For I know their works and their thoughts: it shall <i>troll</i>, that I will gather all nations and <i>polaris</i>; and they shall <i>troll</i>, and <i>varda</i> my <i>fabeness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And I will set a sign among them, and I will <i>lau</i> those that escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the isles <i>nishta ajax</i> off, that have not <i>aunt nelled</i> my fame, <i>nishta</i> have <i>vardad</i> my <i>fabeness</i>; and they shall <i>screech</i> my <i>fabeness</i> among the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they shall <i>parker</i> all your <i>sisters</i> for an <i>parkering</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i> out of all nations upon horses, and in <i>rattling coves</i>, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my <i>fabulosa</i> mountain Jerusalem, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, as the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>parker</i> an <i>parkering</i> in a clean <i>fakement</i> into the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And I will also <i>lell</i> of them for <i>godly homies</i> and for Levites, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, so shall your <i>maria</i> and your name remain.
    </li>
    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, that from <i>una</i> new moon to another, and from <i>una</i> sabbath to another, shall all flesh <i>troll</i> to worship before me, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they shall <i>troll forth</i>, and <i>varda</i> upon the carcases of the <i>homies</i> that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not <i>cark it</i>, <i>nishta</i> shall their <i>binco fakement</i> be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.
