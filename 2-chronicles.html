    <h1>2 Chronicles</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And Solomon the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>Davina</i> was strengthened in <i>her</i> kingdom, and the <i>Duchess</i> <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i> was with <i>her</i>, and magnified <i>her</i> exceedingly.
    </li>
    <li>Then Solomon <i>cackled</i> unto all Israel, to the captains of <i>milles</i> and of <i>chenters</i>, and to the <i>beaks</i>, and to every governor in all Israel, the <i>dowriest</i> of the <i>aunties</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So Solomon, and all the <i>punters</i> with <i>her</i>, <i>trolled</i> to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the <i>bijou tabernaclette</i> of the <i>punters</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, which <i>Maureen</i> the <i>serving homie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> had made in the <i>nishta smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>bijou arkette</i> of <i>Gloria</i> had <i>Davina</i> brought up from Kirjathjearim to the place which <i>Davina</i> had prepared for it: for <i>she</i> had pitched a <i>trolling lettie</i> for it at Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover the brasen <i>grovelling fakement</i>, that Bezaleel the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Uri, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Hur, had made, <i>she</i> put before the <i>bijou tabernaclette</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>: and Solomon and the <i>punters</i> sought unto it.
    </li>
    <li>And Solomon <i>trolled</i> up thither to the brasen <i>grovelling fakement</i> before the <i>Duchess</i>, which was at the <i>bijou tabernaclette</i> of the <i>punters</i>, and offered a <i>mille</i> burnt <i>parkerings</i> upon it.
    </li>
    <li>In that <i>nochy</i> did <i>Gloria</i> appear unto Solomon, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Ask what I shall <i>parker</i> thee.
    </li>
    <li>And Solomon <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Gloria</i>, Thou hast shewed <i>dowry</i> mercy unto <i>Davina</i> my <i>Auntie</i>, and hast made me to reign in <i>her</i> stead.
    </li>
    <li>Now, O <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>, let thy promise unto <i>Davina</i> my <i>Auntie</i> be established: for thou hast made me <i>dowriest homie</i> over a <i>homies and palones</i> like the dust of the earth in multitude.
    </li>
    <li><i>Parker</i> me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may <i>troll out</i> and <i>troll</i> in before this <i>homies and palones</i>: for who can <i>beak</i> this thy <i>homies and palones</i>, that is so <i>dowry</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i> to Solomon, Because this was in thine <i>thumping cheat</i>, and thou hast not asked riches, <i>metties</i>, or honour, <i>nishta</i> the life of thine enemies, <i>nishta</i> yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest <i>beak</i> my <i>homies and palones</i>, over whom I have made thee <i>dowriest homie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will <i>parker</i> thee riches, and <i>metties</i>, and honour, such as none of the <i>dowriest homies</i> have had that have been before thee, <i>nishta</i> shall there any after thee have the like.
    </li>
    <li>Then Solomon <i>trolled</i> from <i>her</i> journey to the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the <i>bijou tabernaclette</i> of the <i>punters</i>, and reigned over Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And Solomon gathered <i>rattling coves</i> and horsemen: and <i>she</i> had a <i>mille</i> and <i>quarter</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>rattling coves</i>, and <i>kenza</i> <i>mille</i> horsemen, which <i>she</i> placed in the <i>trundling cheat</i> <i>smokes</i>, and with the <i>dowriest homie</i> at Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> made silver and <i>gelt</i> at Jerusalem as plenteous as stones, and cedar trees made <i>she</i> as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for abundance.
    </li>
    <li>And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and <i>lycra</i> yarn: the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>bodega homies</i> <i>lalled</i> the <i>lycra</i> yarn at a price.
    </li>
    <li>And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a <i>trundling cheat</i> for <i>sey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>medzers</i> of silver, and an horse for an <i>chenter</i> and <i>chinker dacha</i>: and so brought they out horses for all the <i>dowriest homies</i> of the Hittites, and for the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Syria, by their means.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And Solomon determined to build an <i>lattie</i> for the name of the <i>Duchess</i>, and an <i>lattie</i> for <i>her</i> kingdom.
    </li>
    <li>And Solomon <i>cackled</i> out <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> and <i>dacha</i> <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i> to bear burdens, and fourscore <i>mille</i> to hew in the mountain, and <i>trey</i> <i>mille</i> and <i>sey</i> <i>chenter</i> to oversee them.
    </li>
    <li>And Solomon <i>laued</i> to Huram the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Tyre, <i>cackling</i>, As thou didst deal with <i>Davina</i> my <i>Auntie</i>, and didst <i>lau</i> <i>her</i> cedars to build <i>her</i> an <i>lattie</i> to <i>lett</i> therein, even so deal with me.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, I build an <i>lattie</i> to the name of the <i>Duchess</i> my <i>Gloria</i>, to dedicate it to <i>her</i>, and to burn before <i>her</i> <i>bona</i> <i>smelly</i>, and for the continual shewbread, and for the burnt <i>parkerings</i> morning and <i>bijou nochy</i>, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn <i>dowry munjarlees</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i>. This is an ordinance for ever to Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>lattie</i> which I build is <i>dowry</i>: for <i>dowry</i> is our <i>Gloria</i> above all gods.
    </li>
    <li>But who is able to build <i>her</i> an <i>lattie</i>, <i>vardaing</i> the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain <i>her</i>? who am I then, that I should build <i>her</i> an <i>lattie</i>, save only to burn <i>parker</i> before <i>her</i>?
    </li>
    <li><i>Lau</i> me now therefore a <i>homie</i> cunning to <i>acting dickey</i> in <i>gelt</i>, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning <i>homies</i> that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom <i>Davina</i> my <i>Auntie</i> did provide.
    </li>
    <li><i>Lau</i> me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that thy <i>serving homies</i> can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, <i>varda</i>, my <i>serving homies</i> shall be with thy <i>serving homies</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the <i>lattie</i> which I am about to build shall be <i>fortuni</i> <i>dowry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, I will <i>parker</i> to thy <i>serving homies</i>, the hewers that cut timber, <i>dewey dacha</i> <i>mille</i> measures of beaten wheat, and <i>dewey dacha</i> <i>mille</i> measures of barley, and <i>dewey dacha</i> <i>mille</i> baths of <i>sherry</i>, and <i>dewey dacha</i> <i>mille</i> baths of <i>lube</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then Huram the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Tyre answered in <i>screeving</i>, which <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> to Solomon, Because the <i>Duchess</i> hath loved <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>she</i> hath made thee <i>dowriest homie</i> over them.
    </li>
    <li>Huram <i>cackled</i> moreover, <i>fabed</i> be the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath <i>parkered</i> to <i>Davina</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> a wise <i>homie chavvie</i>, endued with prudence and understanding, that might build an <i>lattie</i> for the <i>Duchess</i>, and an <i>lattie</i> for <i>her</i> kingdom.
    </li>
    <li>And now I have <i>laued</i> a cunning <i>homie</i>, endued with understanding, of Huram my <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s,
    </li>
    <li>The <i>homie chavvie</i> of a <i>palone</i> of the <i>palone chavvies</i> of Dan, and <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> was a <i>homie</i> of Tyre, skilful to <i>acting dickey</i> in <i>gelt</i>, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in <i>bona</i> <i>lycra</i>, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to <i>her</i>, with thy cunning <i>homies</i>, and with the cunning <i>homies</i> of my <i>Duchess</i> <i>Davina</i> thy <i>Auntie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the <i>lube</i>, and the <i>sherry</i>, which my <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>cackled</i> of, let <i>her</i> <i>lau</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as <i>dowry</i> as thou shalt need: and we will <i>parker</i> it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith <i>Davina</i> <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> had numbered them; and they were found an <i>chenter</i> and <i>chinker dacha</i> <i>mille</i> and <i>trey</i> <i>mille</i> and <i>sey</i> <i>chenter</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> set <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> and <i>dacha</i> <i>mille</i> of them to be bearers of burdens, and fourscore <i>mille</i> to be hewers in the mountain, and <i>trey</i> <i>mille</i> and <i>sey</i> <i>chenter</i> overseers to set the <i>homies and palones</i> a <i>acting dickey</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Then Solomon began to build the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where the <i>Duchess</i> appeared unto <i>Davina</i> <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, in the place that <i>Davina</i> had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> began to build in the second <i>journo</i> of the second month, in the <i>quarter</i> year of <i>her</i> reign.
    </li>
    <li>Now these are the <i>fakements</i> wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>. The length by cubits after the first measure was <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> cubits, and the breadth <i>dewey dacha</i> cubits.
    </li>
    <li>And the porch that was in the front of the <i>lattie</i>, the length of it was according to the breadth of the <i>lattie</i>, <i>dewey dacha</i> cubits, and the height was an <i>chenter</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i>: and <i>she</i> overlaid it within with pure <i>gelt</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowrier</i> <i>lattie</i> <i>she</i> cieled with fir tree, which <i>she</i> overlaid with <i>bona</i> <i>gelt</i>, and set thereon palm trees and chains.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> garnished the <i>lattie</i> with precious stones for beauty: and the <i>gelt</i> was <i>gelt</i> of Parvaim.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> overlaid also the <i>lattie</i>, the beams, the posts, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with <i>gelt</i>; and graved cherubims on the walls.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> made the most <i>fabulosa</i> <i>lattie</i>, the length whereof was according to the breadth of the <i>lattie</i>, <i>dewey dacha</i> cubits, and the breadth thereof <i>dewey dacha</i> cubits: and <i>she</i> overlaid it with <i>bona</i> <i>gelt</i>, amounting to <i>sey</i> <i>chenter</i> talents.
    </li>
    <li>And the weight of the nails was <i>chinker dacha</i> <i>medzers</i> of <i>gelt</i>. And <i>she</i> overlaid the upper chambers with <i>gelt</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And in the most <i>fabulosa</i> <i>lattie</i> <i>she</i> made <i>dewey</i> cherubims of image <i>acting dickey</i>, and overlaid them with <i>gelt</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the wings of the cherubims were <i>dewey dacha</i> cubits long: <i>una</i> wing of the <i>una</i> cherub was <i>chinker</i> cubits, reaching to the wall of the <i>lattie</i>: and the other wing was likewise <i>chinker</i> cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>una</i> wing of the other cherub was <i>chinker</i> cubits, reaching to the wall of the <i>lattie</i>: and the other wing was <i>chinker</i> cubits also, joining to the wing of the other cherub.
    </li>
    <li>The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth <i>dewey dacha</i> cubits: and they stood on their <i>plates</i>, and their <i>ekes</i> were inward.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and <i>bona</i> <i>lycra</i>, and wrought cherubims thereon.
    </li>
    <li>Also <i>she</i> made before the <i>lattie</i> <i>dewey</i> pillars of <i>trey dacha</i> and <i>chinker</i> cubits high, and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was <i>chinker</i> cubits.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the <i>ekes</i> of the pillars; and made an <i>chenter</i> pomegranates, and put them on the chains.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> reared up the pillars before the <i>holy carsey</i>, <i>una</i> on the <i>sweet martini</i>, and the other on the <i>dry</i>; and <i>screeched</i> the name of that on the <i>sweet martini</i> Jachin, and the name of that on the <i>dry</i> Boaz.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Moreover <i>she</i> made an <i>grovelling fakement</i> of brass, <i>dewey dacha</i> cubits the length thereof, and <i>dewey dacha</i> cubits the breadth thereof, and <i>dacha</i> cubits the height thereof.
    </li>
    <li>Also <i>she</i> made a molten sea of <i>dacha</i> cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and <i>chinker</i> cubits the height thereof; and a line of <i>trey dacha</i> cubits did compass it round about.
    </li>
    <li>And under it was the similitude of oxen, which did compass it round about: <i>dacha</i> in a cubit, compassing the sea round about. <i>Dewey</i> rows of oxen were cast, when it was cast.
    </li>
    <li>It stood upon <i>kenza</i> oxen, <i>trey</i> looking toward the north, and <i>trey</i> looking toward the west, and <i>trey</i> looking toward the south, and <i>trey</i> looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.
    </li>
    <li>And the thickness of it was an handbreadth, and the brim of it like the <i>acting dickey</i> of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; and it <i>lalled</i> and held <i>trey</i> <i>mille</i> baths.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> made also <i>dacha</i> lavers, and put <i>chinker</i> on the <i>sweet martini</i>, and <i>chinker</i> on the <i>dry</i>, to <i>dhobie</i> in them: such <i>fakements</i> as they offered for the burnt <i>parkering</i> they <i>dhobied</i> in them; but the sea was for the <i>godly homies</i> to <i>dhobie</i> in.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> made <i>dacha</i> candlesticks of <i>gelt</i> according to their form, and set them in the <i>holy carsey</i>, <i>chinker</i> on the <i>sweet martini</i>, and <i>chinker</i> on the <i>dry</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> made also <i>dacha</i> tables, and placed them in the <i>holy carsey</i>, <i>chinker</i> on the <i>sweet</i> side, and <i>chinker</i> on the <i>dry</i>. And <i>she</i> made an <i>chenter</i> basons of <i>gelt</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Furthermore <i>she</i> made the court of the <i>godly homies</i>, and the <i>dowry</i> court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> set the sea on the <i>sweet</i> side of the east end, over against the south.
    </li>
    <li>And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And Huram finished the <i>acting dickey</i> that <i>she</i> was to make for <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon for the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>;
    </li>
    <li>To wit, the <i>dewey</i> pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters which were on the top of the <i>dewey</i> pillars, and the <i>dewey</i> wreaths to cover the <i>dewey</i> pommels of the chapiters which were on the top of the pillars;
    </li>
    <li>And <i>quarter</i> <i>chenter</i> pomegranates on the <i>dewey</i> wreaths; <i>dewey</i> rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the <i>dewey</i> pommels of the chapiters which were upon the pillars.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> made also bases, and lavers made <i>she</i> upon the bases;
    </li>
    <li><i>Una</i> sea, and <i>kenza</i> oxen under it.
    </li>
    <li>The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their instruments, did Huram <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> make to <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon for the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> of bright brass.
    </li>
    <li>In the plain of Jordan did the <i>dowriest homie</i> cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah.
    </li>
    <li>Thus Solomon made all these <i>fakements</i> in <i>dowry</i> abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out.
    </li>
    <li>And Solomon made all the <i>fakements</i> that were for the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, the golden <i>grovelling fakement</i> also, and the tables whereon the shewbread was set;
    </li>
    <li>Moreover the candlesticks with their <i>bincos</i>, that they should burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure <i>gelt</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And the flowers, and the <i>bincos</i>, and the tongs, made <i>she</i> of <i>gelt</i>, and that <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i> <i>gelt</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers, of pure <i>gelt</i>: and the entry of the <i>lattie</i>, the inner doors thereof for the most <i>fabulosa</i> place, and the doors of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>holy carsey</i>, were of <i>gelt</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Thus all the <i>acting dickey</i> that Solomon made for the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> was finished: and Solomon brought in all the <i>fakements</i> that <i>Davina</i> <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> had dedicated; and the silver, and the <i>gelt</i>, and all the instruments, put <i>she</i> among the <i>gelt</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then Solomon assembled the <i>fungi</i> of Israel, and all the <i>ekes</i> of the tribes, the <i>dowriest</i> of the <i>aunties</i> of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to <i>parker</i> up the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the covenant of the <i>Duchess</i> out of the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i>, which is Zion.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore all the <i>homies</i> of Israel assembled themselves unto the <i>dowriest homie</i> in the <i>dowry munjarlee</i> which was in the <i>setterth</i> month.
    </li>
    <li>And all the <i>fungi</i> of Israel <i>trolled</i>; and the Levites <i>lelled</i> up the <i>bijou arkette</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they brought up the <i>bijou arkette</i>, and the <i>bijou tabernaclette</i> of the <i>punters</i>, and all the <i>fabulosa</i> <i>fakements</i> that were in the <i>bijou tabernaclette</i>, these did the <i>godly homies</i> and the Levites <i>parker</i> up.
    </li>
    <li>Also <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon, and all the <i>punters</i> of Israel that were assembled unto <i>her</i> before the <i>bijou arkette</i>, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be <i>cackled</i> <i>nishta</i> numbered for multitude.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>godly homies</i> brought in the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the covenant of the <i>Duchess</i> unto <i>her</i> place, to the oracle of the <i>lattie</i>, into the most <i>fabulosa</i> place, even under the wings of the cherubims:
    </li>
    <li>For the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the <i>bijou arkette</i>, and the cherubims covered the <i>bijou arkette</i> and the staves thereof above.
    </li>
    <li>And they drew out the staves of the <i>bijou arkette</i>, that the ends of the staves were <i>vardad</i> from the <i>bijou arkette</i> before the oracle; but they were not <i>vardad</i> <i>nanti</i>. And there it is unto this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>There was <i>nishter</i> in the <i>bijou arkette</i> save the <i>dewey</i> tables which <i>Maureen</i> put therein at Horeb, when the <i>Duchess</i> made a covenant with the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, when they <i>trolled</i> out of Egypt.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when the <i>godly homies</i> were <i>troll</i> out of the <i>fabulosa</i> place: (for all the <i>godly homies</i> that were present were sanctified, and did not then wait by course:
    </li>
    <li>Also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their <i>homie chavvies</i> and their <i>sisters</i>, being arrayed in white <i>lycra</i>, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the <i>grovelling fakement</i>, and with them an <i>chenter</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i> <i>godly homies</i> sounding with trumpets:)
    </li>
    <li>It <i>trolled</i> even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as <i>una</i>, to make <i>una</i> sound to be <i>aunt nelled</i> in praising and thanking the <i>Duchess</i>; and when they lifted up their <i>cackling fakement</i> with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick, and praised the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>cackling</i>, For <i>she</i> is <i>bona</i>; for <i>her</i> mercy endureth for ever: that then the <i>lattie</i> was filled with a cloud, even the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>;
    </li>
    <li>So that the <i>godly homies</i> could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the <i>fabeness</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> had filled the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> Solomon, The <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>cackled</i> that <i>she</i> would <i>lett</i> in the thick <i>munge</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But I have built an <i>lattie</i> of habitation for thee, and a place for thy dwelling for ever.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> turned <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>, and <i>fabed</i> the whole <i>punters</i> of Israel: and all the <i>punters</i> of Israel stood.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>fabed</i> be the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, who hath with <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i> fulfilled that which <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> with <i>her</i> <i>screech</i> to my <i>Auntie</i> <i>Davina</i>, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Since the <i>journo</i> that I brought forth my <i>homies and palones</i> out of the land of Egypt I chose no <i>smoke</i> among all the tribes of Israel to build an <i>lattie</i> in, that my name might be there; <i>nishta</i> chose I any <i>homie</i> to be a ruler over my <i>homies and palones</i> Israel:
    </li>
    <li>But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen <i>Davina</i> to be over my <i>homies and palones</i> Israel.
    </li>
    <li>Now it was in the <i>thumping cheat</i> of <i>Davina</i> my <i>Auntie</i> to build an <i>lattie</i> for the name of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> to <i>Davina</i> my <i>Auntie</i>, Forasmuch as it was in thine <i>thumping cheat</i> to build an <i>lattie</i> for my name, thou didst well in that it was in thine <i>thumping cheat</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Notwithstanding <i>nishta</i> build the <i>lattie</i>; but thy <i>homie chavvie</i> which shall <i>troll</i> forth out of thy loins, <i>she</i> shall build the <i>lattie</i> for my name.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> therefore hath performed <i>her</i> <i>lav</i> that <i>she</i> hath <i>cackled</i>: for I am risen up in the room of <i>Davina</i> my <i>Auntie</i>, and am set on the throne of Israel, as the <i>Duchess</i> promised, and have built the <i>lattie</i> for the name of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And in it have I put the <i>bijou arkette</i>, wherein is the covenant of the <i>Duchess</i>, that <i>she</i> made with the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> stood before the <i>grovelling fakement</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> in the presence of all the <i>punters</i> of Israel, and spread forth <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i>:

    <li>For Solomon had made a brasen scaffold of <i>chinker</i> cubits long, and <i>chinker</i> cubits broad, and <i>trey</i> cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court: and upon it <i>she</i> stood, and kneeled down upon <i>her</i> knees before all the <i>punters</i> of Israel, and spread forth <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i> toward heaven.

    </li>
    <li>Now then, O <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, let thy <i>lav</i> be verified, which thou hast <i>cackled</i> unto thy <i>serving homie</i> <i>Davina</i>.

    <li>But will <i>Gloria</i> in <i>dowry</i> deed <i>lett</i> with <i>homies</i> on the earth? <i>varda</i>, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how <i>dowry</i> <i>nanti dowry</i> this <i>lattie</i> which I have built!
    </li>
    <li>Have respect therefore to the <i>meshigener muttering</i> of thy <i>serving homie</i>, and to <i>her</i> supplication, O <i>Duchess</i> my <i>Gloria</i>, to <i>aunt nell</i> unto the <i>screech</i> and the <i>meshigener muttering</i> which thy <i>serving homie</i> prayeth before thee:

    <li>That thine <i>ogles</i> may be open upon this <i>lattie</i> <i>journo</i> and <i>nochy</i>, upon the place whereof thou hast <i>cackled</i> that thou wouldest put thy name there; to <i>aunt nell</i> unto the <i>meshigener muttering</i> which thy <i>serving homie</i> prayeth toward this place.
    </li>
    <li><i>Aunt nell</i> therefore unto the supplications of thy <i>serving homie</i>, and of thy <i>homies and palones</i> Israel, which they shall make toward this place: <i>aunt nell</i> thou from thy <i>lattie</i>, even from heaven; and when thou hearest, forgive.
    </li>
    <li>If a <i>homie</i> <i>kertever</i> against <i>her</i> <i>homie ajax</i>, and an oath be <i>laued</i> upon <i>her</i> to make <i>her</i> swear, and the oath <i>troll</i> before thine <i>grovelling fakement</i> in this <i>lattie</i>;

    <li>Then <i>aunt nell</i> thou from heaven, and do, and <i>beak</i> thy <i>serving homies</i>, by requiting the <i>naff</i>, by recompensing <i>her</i> way upon <i>her</i> own <i>eke</i>; and by justifying the <i>bona</i>, by giving <i>her</i> according to <i>her</i> <i>bonaness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And if thy <i>homies and palones</i> Israel be put to the worse before the enemy, because they have <i>kertervered</i> against thee; and shall return and <i>dish</i> thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this <i>lattie</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>aunt nell</i> thou from the heavens, and forgive the <i>kertever</i> of thy <i>homies and palones</i> Israel, and <i>parker</i> them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their <i>aunties</i>.
    </li>
    <li>When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have <i>kertervered</i> against thee; yet if they pray toward this place, and <i>dish</i> thy name, and turn from their <i>kertever</i>, when thou dost afflict them;

    <li>Then <i>aunt nell</i> thou from heaven, and forgive the <i>kertever</i> of thy <i>serving homies</i>, and of thy <i>homies and palones</i> Israel, when thou hast taught them the <i>bona</i> way, wherein they should <i>mince</i>; and <i>lau</i> rain upon thy land, which thou hast <i>parkered</i> unto thy <i>homies and palones</i> for an inheritance.

    <li>If there be dearth in the land, if there be <i>bad style</i>, if there be blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillers; if their enemies besiege them in the <i>smokes</i> of their land; whatsoever sore or whatsoever <i>kerterver coddy</i> there be:

    <li>Then <i>aunt nell</i> thou from heaven thy <i>lattie</i>, and forgive, and render unto every <i>homie</i> according unto all <i>her</i> ways, whose <i>thumping cheat</i> thou knowest; (for thou only knowest the <i>thumping cheats</i> of the <i>chavvies</i> of <i>homies</i>🙂

    <li>That they may fear thee, to <i>mince</i> in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our <i>aunties</i>.

    </li>
    <li>If thy <i>homies and palones</i> <i>troll out</i> to <i>barney</i> against their enemies by the way that thou shalt <i>lau</i> them, and they pray unto thee toward this <i>smoke</i> which thou hast chosen, and the <i>lattie</i> which I have built for thy name;
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>aunt nell</i> thou from the heavens their <i>meshigener muttering</i> and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
    </li>
    <li>If they <i>kertever</i> against thee, (for there is no <i>homie</i> which <i>kertervereth</i> not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over before their enemies, and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or near;
    </li>
    <li>Yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are <i>lelled</i> captive, and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their captivity, <i>cackling</i>, We have <i>kertervered</i>, we have done amiss, and have dealt wickedly;
    </li>
    <li>If they <i>troll back to</i> thee with all their <i>thumping cheat</i> and with all their <i>nishta lucoddy</i> in the land of their captivity, whither they have <i>lelled</i> them captives, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest unto their <i>aunties</i>, and toward the <i>smoke</i> which thou hast chosen, and toward the <i>lattie</i> which I have built for thy name:

    <li>Then <i>aunt nell</i> thou from the heavens, even from thy <i>lattie</i>, their <i>meshigener muttering</i> and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive thy <i>homies and palones</i> which have <i>kertervered</i> against thee.

    <li>Now, my <i>Gloria</i>, let, I beseech thee, thine <i>ogles</i> be open, and let thine <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> be attent unto the <i>meshigener muttering</i> that is made in this place.
    </li>
    <li>Now therefore arise, O <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>, into thy resting place, thou, and the <i>bijou arkette</i> of thy <i>butchness</i>: let thy <i>godly homies</i>, O <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness.

    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the <i>binco fakement</i> <i>trolled</i> down from heaven, and consumed the burnt <i>parkering</i> and the <i>parkers</i>; and the <i>fabeness</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> filled the <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>godly homies</i> could not enter into the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, because the <i>fabeness</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> had filled the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when all the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>vardad</i> how the <i>binco fakement</i> <i>trolled</i> down, and the <i>fabeness</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> upon the <i>lattie</i>, they bowed themselves with their <i>ekes</i> to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and praised the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>cackling</i>, For <i>she</i> is <i>bona</i>; for <i>her</i> mercy endureth for ever.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>dowriest homie</i> and all the <i>homies and palones</i> offered <i>parkers</i> before the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon offered a <i>parker</i> of <i>dewey dacha</i> and <i>dewey</i> <i>mille</i> oxen, and an <i>chenter</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i> <i>mille</i> sheep: so the <i>dowriest homie</i> and all the <i>homies and palones</i> dedicated the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>godly homies</i> waited on their offices: the Levites also with instruments of musick of the <i>Duchess</i>, which <i>Davina</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> had made to praise the <i>Duchess</i>, because <i>her</i> mercy endureth for ever, when <i>Davina</i> praised by their ministry; and the <i>godly homies</i> sounded trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>: for there <i>she</i> offered burnt <i>parkerings</i>, and the fat of the peace <i>parkerings</i>, because the brasen <i>grovelling fakement</i> which Solomon had made was not able to <i>lall</i> the burnt <i>parkerings</i>, and the <i>carnish</i> <i>parkerings</i>, and the fat.
    </li>
    <li>Also at the same time Solomon kept the <i>dowry munjarlee</i> <i>setter</i> days, and all Israel with <i>her</i>, a <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry</i> <i>punters</i>, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt.
    </li>
    <li>And in the <i>otterth</i> <i>journo</i> they made a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the <i>grovelling fakement</i> <i>setter</i> days, and the <i>dowry munjarlee</i> <i>setter</i> days.
    </li>
    <li>And on the <i>trey</i> and <i>dewey dachath</i> <i>journo</i> of the <i>setterth</i> month <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> the <i>homies and palones</i> away into their <i>trolling letties</i>, glad and merry in <i>thumping cheat</i> for the goodness that the <i>Duchess</i> had shewed unto <i>Davina</i>, and to Solomon, and to Israel <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thus Solomon finished the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>: and all that <i>trolled</i> into Solomon&#8217;s <i>thumping cheat</i> to make in the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and in <i>her</i> own <i>lattie</i>, <i>she</i> prosperously effected.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> appeared to Solomon by <i>nochy</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, I have <i>aunt nelled</i> thy <i>meshigener muttering</i>, and have chosen this place to myself for an <i>lattie</i> of <i>parker</i>.
    </li>
    <li>If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I <i>lau</i> <i>bad style</i> among my <i>homies and palones</i>;
    </li>
    <li>If my <i>homies and palones</i>, which are <i>screeched</i> by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and <i>charper</i> my <i>eke</i>, and turn from their <i>naff</i> ways; then will I <i>aunt nell</i> from heaven, and will forgive their <i>kertever</i>, and will heal their land.
    </li>
    <li>Now mine <i>ogles</i> shall be open, and mine <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> attent unto the <i>meshigener muttering</i> that is made in this place.
    </li>
    <li>For now have I chosen and sanctified this <i>lattie</i>, that my name may be there for ever: and mine <i>ogles</i> and mine <i>thumping cheat</i> shall be there perpetually.
    </li>
    <li>And as for thee, if thou wilt <i>mince</i> before me, as <i>Davina</i> thy <i>Auntie</i> <i>minced</i>, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt observe my <i>dowry lavs</i> and my judgments;
    </li>
    <li>Then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I have covenanted with <i>Davina</i> thy <i>Auntie</i>, <i>cackling</i>, There shall not fail thee a <i>homie</i> to be ruler in Israel.
    </li>
    <li>But if ye turn away, and forsake my <i>dowry lavs</i> and my <i>butch lavs</i>, which I have set before you, and shall <i>troll</i> and serve other gods, and worship them;
    </li>
    <li>Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have <i>parkered</i> them; and this <i>lattie</i>, which I have sanctified for my name, will I cast out of my <i>vardaing</i>, and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all nations.
    </li>
    <li>And this <i>lattie</i>, which is high, shall be an <i>gobsmacked-ness</i> to every <i>una</i> that passeth by it; so that <i>she</i> shall <i>cackle</i>, Why hath the <i>Duchess</i> done thus unto this land, and unto this <i>lattie</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of their <i>aunties</i>, which brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and <i>laued</i> hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath <i>she</i> brought all this <i>nana</i> upon them.

    <li>That the <i>smokes</i> which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel to <i>lett</i> there.
    </li>
    <li>And Solomon <i>trolled</i> to Hamathzobah, and prevailed against it.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> built Tadmor in the <i>nishta smoke</i>, and all the store <i>smokes</i>, which <i>she</i> built in Hamath.
    </li>
    <li>Also <i>she</i> built Bethhoron the upper, and Bethhoron the nether, fenced <i>smokes</i>, with walls, gates, and bars;

    <li>And Baalath, and all the store <i>smokes</i> that Solomon had, and all the <i>trundling cheat</i> <i>smokes</i>, and the <i>smokes</i> of the horsemen, and all that Solomon <i>fancied</i> to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the land of <i>her</i> dominion.
    </li>
    <li>As for all the <i>homies and palones</i> that were <i>dry</i> of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which were not of Israel,
    </li>
    <li>But of their <i>chavvies</i>, who were <i>dry</i> after them in the land, whom the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel consumed not, them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel did Solomon make no <i>serving homies</i> for <i>her</i> <i>acting dickey</i>; but they were <i>homies</i> of <i>barney</i>, and <i>dowriest</i> of <i>her</i> captains, and captains of <i>her</i> <i>rattling coves</i> and horsemen.
    </li>
    <li>And these were the <i>dowriest</i> of <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon&#8217;s <i>hilda handcuffs</i>, even <i>dewey</i> <i>chenter</i> and <i>chinker dacha</i>, that bare rule over the <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Solomon brought up the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Pharaoh out of the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i> unto the <i>lattie</i> that <i>she</i> had built for her: for <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, My <i>palone affair</i> shall not <i>lett</i> in the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Davina</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel, because the places are <i>fabulosa</i>, whereunto the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>troll</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then Solomon offered burnt <i>parkerings</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i> on the <i>grovelling fakement</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, which <i>she</i> had built before the porch,
    </li>
    <li>Even after a certain rate every <i>journo</i>, <i>parkering</i> according to the <i>butch lav</i> of <i>Maureen</i>, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn <i>dowry munjarlees</i>, <i>trey</i> times in the year, even in the <i>dowry munjarlee</i> of unleavened <i>pannan</i>, and in the <i>dowry munjarlee</i> of weeks, and in the <i>dowry munjarlee</i> of <i>bijoux tabernaclettes</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> appointed, according to the order of <i>Davina</i> <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, the courses of the <i>godly homies</i> to their service, and the Levites to their charges, to praise and minister before the <i>godly homies</i>, as the duty of every <i>journo</i> required: the porters also by their courses at every gate: for so had <i>Davina</i> the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> commanded.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>trolled off</i> not from the <i>butch lav</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> unto the <i>godly homies</i> and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the <i>gelt</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now all the <i>acting dickey</i> of Solomon was prepared unto the <i>journo</i> of the foundation of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and until it was finished. So the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> was perfected.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>trolled</i> Solomon to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in the land of Edom.

    <li>And Huram <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> by the <i>fambles</i> of <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i> <i>latties on water</i>, and <i>serving homies</i> that had knowledge of the sea; and they <i>trolled</i> with the <i>serving homies</i> of Solomon to Ophir, and <i>lelled</i> thence <i>quarter</i> <i>chenter</i> and <i>chinker dacha</i> talents of <i>gelt</i>, and brought them to <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon.

    <li>And Solomon <i>cackled</i> her all her questions: and there was <i>nishter</i> hid from Solomon which <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> her not.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>dowriest palone</i> of Sheba had <i>vardad</i> the wisdom of Solomon, and the <i>lattie</i> that <i>she</i> had built,

    <li>And she <i>cackled</i> to the <i>dowriest homie</i>, It was a true report which I <i>aunt nelled</i> in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom:

    <li>Happy are thy <i>homies</i>, and happy are these thy <i>serving homies</i>, which stand continually before thee, and <i>aunt nell</i> thy wisdom.

    <li><i>Fabed</i> be the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i>, which delighted in thee to set thee on <i>her</i> throne, to be <i>dowriest homie</i> for the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i>: because thy <i>Gloria</i> loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made <i>she</i> thee <i>dowriest homie</i> over them, to do judgment and justice.
    </li>
    <li>And she <i>parkered</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> an <i>chenter</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i> talents of <i>gelt</i>, and of spices <i>dowry</i> abundance, and precious stones: <i>nishta</i> was there any such spice as the <i>dowriest palone</i> of Sheba <i>parkered</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>serving homies</i> also of Huram, and the <i>serving homies</i> of Solomon, which brought <i>gelt</i> from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> made of the algum trees terraces to the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and to the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>dowry lattie</i>, and harps and psalteries for singers: and there were none such <i>vardad</i> before in the land of Judah.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon <i>parkered</i> to the <i>dowriest palone</i> of Sheba all her <i>fancy</i>, whatsoever she asked, beside that which she had brought unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>. So she turned, and <i>trolled</i> away to her own land, she and her <i>serving homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now the weight of <i>gelt</i> that <i>trolled</i> to Solomon in <i>una</i> year was <i>sey</i> <i>chenter</i> and <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> and <i>sey</i> talents of <i>gelt</i>;

    <li>Beside that which chapmen and <i>bodega homies</i> brought. And all the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Arabia and governors of the country brought <i>gelt</i> and silver to Solomon.

    <li>And <i>trey</i> <i>chenter</i> shields made <i>she</i> of beaten <i>gelt</i>: <i>trey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>medzers</i> of <i>gelt</i> <i>trolled</i> to <i>una</i> shield. And the <i>dowriest homie</i> put them in the <i>lattie</i> of the forest of Lebanon.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover the <i>dowriest homie</i> made a <i>dowry</i> throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure <i>gelt</i>.

    <li>And there were <i>sey</i> steps to the throne, with a footstool of <i>gelt</i>, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on each side of the sitting place, and <i>dewey</i> lions standing by the stays:

    <li>And <i>kenza</i> lions stood there on the <i>una</i> side and on the other upon the <i>sey</i> steps. There was not the like made in any kingdom.

    <li>And all the <i>bevvying</i> <i>fakements</i> of <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon were of <i>gelt</i>, and all the <i>fakements</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of the forest of Lebanon were of pure <i>gelt</i>: none were of silver; it was not any <i>fakement</i> accounted of in the days of Solomon.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>latties on water</i> <i>trolled</i> to Tarshish with the <i>serving homies</i> of Huram: every <i>trey</i> years once <i>trolled</i> the <i>latties on water</i> of Tarshish bringing <i>gelt</i>, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon passed all the <i>dowriest homies</i> of the earth in riches and wisdom.
    </li>
    <li>And all the <i>dowriest homies</i> of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to <i>aunt nell</i> <i>her</i> wisdom, that <i>Gloria</i> had put in <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they brought every <i>homie</i> <i>her</i> present, <i>fakements</i> of silver, and <i>fakements</i> of <i>gelt</i>, and <i>clobber</i>, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
    </li>
    <li>And Solomon had <i>quarter</i> <i>mille</i> stalls for horses and <i>rattling coves</i>, and <i>kenza</i> <i>mille</i> horsemen; whom <i>she</i> bestowed in the <i>trundling cheat</i> <i>smokes</i>, and with the <i>dowriest homie</i> at Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> reigned over all the <i>dowriest homies</i> from the river even unto the land of the <i>naffs</i>, and to the border of Egypt.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees made <i>she</i> as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains in abundance.
    </li>
    <li>And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all lands.
    </li>
    <li>Now the <i>lettie</i> of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nebat?

    <li>And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel <i>quarter dacha</i> years.

    <li>And Solomon <i>lettied</i> with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>, and <i>she</i> was buried in the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i> <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>: and Rehoboam <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> reigned in <i>her</i> stead.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And Rehoboam <i>trolled</i> to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel <i>troll</i> to make <i>her</i> <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when Jeroboam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nebat, who was in Egypt, whither <i>she</i> fled from the presence of Solomon the <i>dowriest homie</i>, <i>aunt nelled</i> it, that Jeroboam <i>trolled back</i> out of Egypt.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>laued</i> and <i>screeched</i> <i>her</i>. So Jeroboam and all Israel <i>trolled</i> and <i>cackled</i> to Rehoboam, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Thy <i>Auntie</i> made our yoke <i>naff</i>: now therefore ease thou somewhat the <i>naff</i> servitude of thy <i>Auntie</i>, and <i>her</i> heavy yoke that <i>she</i> put upon us, and we will serve thee.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>troll</i> again unto me after <i>trey</i> days. And the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>trolled off</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>dowriest homie</i> Rehoboam <i>lelled</i> counsel with the <i>badge coves</i> that had stood before Solomon <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> while <i>she</i> yet lived, <i>cackling</i>, What counsel <i>parker</i> ye me to return answer to this <i>homies and palones</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, If thou be kind to this <i>homies and palones</i>, and please them, and <i>cackle</i> <i>bona</i> <i>lavs</i> to them, they will be thy <i>serving homies</i> for ever.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> forsook the counsel which the <i>badge coves</i> <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i>, and <i>lelled</i> counsel with the <i>bean coves</i> that were brought up with <i>her</i>, that stood before <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, What advice <i>parker</i> ye that we may return answer to this <i>homies and palones</i>, which have <i>cackled</i> to me, <i>cackling</i>, Ease somewhat the yoke that thy <i>Auntie</i> did put upon us?
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>bean coves</i> that were brought up with <i>her</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Thus shalt thou answer the <i>homies and palones</i> that <i>cackled</i> unto thee, <i>cackling</i>, Thy <i>Auntie</i> made our yoke heavy, but make thou it somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou <i>cackle</i> unto them, My <i>bijou</i> <i>lupper</i> shall be thicker than my <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s loins.
    </li>
    <li>For whereas my <i>Auntie</i> put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to your yoke: my <i>Auntie</i> chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
    </li>
    <li>So Jeroboam and all the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>trolled</i> to Rehoboam on the third <i>journo</i>, as the <i>dowriest homie</i> bade, <i>cackling</i>, <i>troll</i> again to me on the third <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> answered them roughly; and <i>dowriest homie</i> Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the <i>badge coves</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And answered them after the advice of the <i>bean coves</i>, <i>cackling</i>, My <i>Auntie</i> made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my <i>Auntie</i> chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
    </li>
    <li>So the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> not unto the <i>homies and palones</i>: for the cause was of <i>Gloria</i>, that the <i>Duchess</i> might perform <i>her</i> <i>lav</i>, which <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> by the <i>famble</i> of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nebat.
    </li>
    <li>And when all Israel <i>vardad</i> that the <i>dowriest homie</i> would not <i>aunt nell</i> unto them, the <i>homies and palones</i> answered the <i>dowriest homie</i>, <i>cackling</i>, What portion have we in <i>Davina</i>? and we have none inheritance in the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jesse: every <i>homie</i> to your <i>trolling letties</i>, O Israel: and now, <i>Davina</i>, <i>varda</i> to thine own <i>lattie</i>. So all Israel <i>trolled</i> to their <i>trolling letties</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But as for the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel that <i>letted</i> in the <i>smokes</i> of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>dowriest homie</i> Rehoboam <i>laued</i> Hadoram that was over the tribute; and the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel stoned <i>her</i> with stones, that <i>she</i> <i>carked it</i>. But <i>dowriest homie</i> Rehoboam made speed to get <i>her</i> up to <i>her</i> <i>trundling cheat</i>, to <i>scarper</i> to Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And Israel rebelled against the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Davina</i> unto this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And when Rehoboam was <i>troll</i> to Jerusalem, <i>she</i> gathered of the <i>lattie</i> of Judah and Benjamin an <i>chenter</i> and fourscore <i>mille</i> chosen <i>homies</i>, which were warriors, to <i>palaver</i> against Israel, that <i>she</i> might <i>parker</i> the kingdom again to Rehoboam.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> to Shemaiah the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackle</i> unto Rehoboam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Solomon, <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>nanti</i> <i>troll</i> up, <i>nishta</i> <i>palaver</i> against your <i>sisters</i>: return every <i>homie</i> to <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>: for this <i>fakement</i> is done of me. And they obeyed the <i>lavs</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>trolled back</i> from going against Jeroboam.
    </li>
    <li>And Rehoboam <i>letted</i> in Jerusalem, and built <i>smokes</i> for defence in Judah.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,
    </li>
    <li>And Bethzur, and Shoco, and Adullam,
    </li>
    <li>And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,
    </li>
    <li>And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,
    </li>
    <li>And Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin fenced <i>smokes</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> fortified the <i>butch</i> holds, and put captains in them, and store of victual, and of <i>lube</i> and <i>sherry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And in every several <i>smoke</i> <i>she</i> put shields and spears, and made them exceeding <i>butch</i>, having Judah and Benjamin on <i>her</i> side.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>godly homies</i> and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to <i>her</i> out of all their coasts.
    </li>
    <li>For the Levites <i>dry</i> their suburbs and their <i>fakement</i>, and <i>trolled</i> to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> had cast them off from executing the <i>godly homie</i>&#8216;s office unto the <i>Duchess</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> ordained <i>her</i> <i>godly homies</i> for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which <i>she</i> had made.
    </li>
    <li>And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their <i>thumping cheats</i> to <i>charper</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel <i>trolled</i> to Jerusalem, to <i>parker</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of their <i>aunties</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Solomon <i>butch</i>, <i>trey</i> years: for <i>trey</i> years they <i>minced</i> in the way of <i>Davina</i> and Solomon.
    </li>
    <li>And Rehoboam <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> Mahalath the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Jerimoth the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>Davina</i> to <i>palone affair</i>, and Abihail the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Eliab the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jesse;
    </li>
    <li>Which bare <i>her</i> <i>chavvies</i>; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.
    </li>
    <li>And after her <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> Maachah the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Absalom; which bare <i>her</i> Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.
    </li>
    <li>And Rehoboam loved Maachah the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Absalom above all <i>her</i> <i>palone affairs</i> and <i>her</i> concubines: (for <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> eighteen <i>palone affairs</i>, and <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> concubines; and <i>chavvied</i> <i>dewey dacha</i> and <i>say dooe</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>, and <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> <i>palone chavvies</i>. )
    </li>
    <li>And Rehoboam made Abijah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Maachah the <i>dowriest</i>, to be ruler among <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>: for <i>she</i> thought to make <i>her</i> <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> dealt wisely, and dispersed of all <i>her</i> <i>chavvies</i> throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced <i>smoke</i>: and <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> them victual in abundance. And <i>she</i> <i>fancied</i> many <i>palone affairs</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, <i>she</i> forsook the law of the <i>Duchess</i>, and all Israel with <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, that in the fifth year of <i>dowriest homie</i> Rehoboam Shishak <i>dowriest homie</i> of Egypt <i>trolled</i> up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the <i>Duchess</i>,
    </li>
    <li>With <i>kenza</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>rattling coves</i>, and <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> <i>mille</i> horsemen: and the <i>homies and palones</i> were <i>nanti</i> number that <i>trolled</i> with <i>her</i> out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> the fenced <i>smokes</i> which pertained to Judah, and <i>trolled</i> to Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>trolled</i> Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the <i>princesses</i> of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and <i>cackled</i> unto them, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also <i>dry</i> you in the <i>famble</i> of Shishak.
    </li>
    <li>Whereupon the <i>princesses</i> of Israel and the <i>dowriest homie</i> humbled themselves; and they <i>cackled</i>, The <i>Duchess</i> is <i>bona</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>Duchess</i> <i>vardad</i> that they humbled themselves, the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> to Shemaiah, <i>cackling</i>, They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not <i>battyfang</i> them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the <i>famble</i> of Shishak.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> they shall be <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.
    </li>
    <li>So Shishak <i>dowriest homie</i> of Egypt <i>trolled</i> up against Jerusalem, and <i>lelled</i> away the <i>gelt</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and the <i>gelt</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>; <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> all: <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> away also the shields of <i>gelt</i> which Solomon had made.
    </li>
    <li>Instead of which <i>dowriest homie</i> Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed them to the <i>fambles</i> of the <i>dowriest</i> of the <i>charpering homie</i>, that kept the entrance of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>dowriest homie</i> entered into the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, the <i>charpering homie</i> <i>trolled</i> and fetched them, and brought them again into the <i>charpering homie</i> <i>booth</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> humbled himself, the wrath of the <i>Duchess</i> turned from <i>her</i>, that <i>she</i> would not <i>battyfang</i> <i>her</i> altogether: and also in Judah <i>fakements</i> <i>trolled</i> well.
    </li>
    <li>So <i>dowriest homie</i> Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was <i>una</i> and <i>quarter dacha</i> years <i>badge</i> when <i>she</i> began to reign, and <i>she</i> reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the <i>smoke</i> which the <i>Duchess</i> had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put <i>her</i> name there. And <i>her</i> mother&#8217;s name was Naamah an Ammonitess.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> did <i>nana</i>, because <i>she</i> prepared not <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> to <i>charper</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
    </li>
    <li>And Rehoboam <i>lettied</i> with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>, and was buried in the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i>: and Abijah <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> reigned in <i>her</i> stead.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 13</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now in the eighteenth year of <i>dowriest homie</i> Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> reigned <i>trey</i> years in Jerusalem. <i>Her</i> mother&#8217;s name also was Michaiah the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was <i>barney</i> between Abijah and Jeroboam.
    </li>
    <li>And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant <i>homies</i> of <i>barney</i>, even <i>quarter</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>mille</i> chosen <i>homies</i>: Jeroboam also set the battle in array against <i>her</i> with <i>say dooe</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>mille</i> chosen <i>homies</i>, being <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i> of valour.
    </li>
    <li>And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount Ephraim, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>aunt nell</i> me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;
    </li>
    <li>Ought ye not to know that the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel <i>parkered</i> the kingdom over Israel to <i>Davina</i> for ever, even to <i>her</i> and to <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> by a covenant of salt?
    </li>
    <li>Yet Jeroboam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nebat, the <i>serving homie</i> of Solomon the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>Davina</i>, is risen up, and hath rebelled against <i>her</i> <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And there are gathered unto <i>her</i> vain <i>homies</i>, the <i>chavvies</i> of Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Solomon, when Rehoboam was <i>bean</i> and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them.
    </li>
    <li>And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the <i>Duchess</i> in the <i>famble</i> of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of <i>Davina</i>; and ye be a <i>dowry</i> multitude, and there are with your golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods.
    </li>
    <li>Have ye not cast out the <i>godly homies</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you <i>godly homies</i> after the manner of the nations of other lands? so that whosoever <i>trolleth</i> to consecrate himself with a <i>bean</i> bullock and <i>setter</i> rams, the same may be a <i>godly homie</i> of them that are no gods.
    </li>
    <li>But as for us, the <i>Duchess</i> is our <i>Gloria</i>, and we have not forsaken <i>her</i>; and the <i>godly homies</i>, which minister unto the <i>Duchess</i>, are the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Aaron, and the Levites wait upon their business:
    </li>
    <li>And they burn unto the <i>Duchess</i> every morning and every <i>bijou nochy</i> burnt <i>parkers</i> and <i>bona</i> <i>smelly</i>: the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of <i>gelt</i> with the <i>bincos</i> thereof, to burn every <i>bijou nochy</i>: for we keep the charge of the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i>; but ye have forsaken <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, <i>Gloria</i> himself is with us for our captain, and <i>her</i> <i>godly homies</i> with sounding trumpets to <i>screech</i> alarm against you. O <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, <i>palaver</i> ye not against the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of your <i>aunties</i>; for <i>nanti</i> prosper.
    </li>
    <li>But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to <i>troll</i> about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.
    </li>
    <li>And when Judah looked back, <i>varda</i>, the battle was before and behind: and they <i>screeched</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>, and the <i>godly homies</i> sounded with the trumpets.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>homies</i> of Judah <i>parkered</i> a <i>screech</i>: and as the <i>homies</i> of Judah shouted, it <i>trolled</i> to pass, that <i>Gloria</i> <i>slapped</i> Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel fled before Judah: and <i>Gloria</i> <i>laued</i> them into their <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Abijah and <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i> <i>ferricadoozaed</i> them with a <i>dowry</i> slaughter: so there fell down <i>ferricadoozed</i> of Israel <i>chinker</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>mille</i> chosen <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thus the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel were brought under at that time, and the <i>chavvies</i> of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of their <i>aunties</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and <i>lelled</i> <i>smokes</i> from <i>her</i>, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephraim with the towns thereof.
    </li>
    <li><i>Nishta</i> did Jeroboam recover <i>butchness</i> again in the days of Abijah: and the <i>Duchess</i> struck <i>her</i>, and <i>she</i> <i>carked it</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But Abijah waxed <i>dowry butch</i>, and married fourteen <i>palone affairs</i>, and <i>chavvied</i> <i>dewey dacha</i> and <i>dewey</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>, and sixteen <i>palone chavvies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>lettie</i> of the acts of Abijah, and <i>her</i> ways, and <i>her</i> sayings, are <i>screeved</i> in the story of the prophet Iddo.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 14</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>So Abijah <i>lettied</i> with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>, and they buried <i>her</i> in the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i>: and Asa <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> reigned in <i>her</i> stead. In <i>her</i> days the land was quiet <i>dacha</i> years.
    </li>
    <li>And Asa did that which was <i>bona</i> and <i>sweet</i> in the <i>ogles</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i>:
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:
    </li>
    <li>And commanded Judah to <i>charper</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of their <i>aunties</i>, and to do the law and the <i>butch lav</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Also <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> away out of all the <i>smokes</i> of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> built fenced <i>smokes</i> in Judah: for the land had <i>lettie</i>, and <i>she</i> had no <i>barney</i> in those years; because the <i>Duchess</i> had <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> <i>lettie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Judah, Let us build these <i>smokes</i>, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i>, we have sought <i>her</i>, and <i>she</i> hath <i>parkered</i> us <i>lettie</i> on every side. So they built and prospered.
    </li>
    <li>And Asa had an army of <i>homies</i> that bare targets and spears, out of Judah <i>trey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>mille</i>; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, <i>dewey</i> <i>chenter</i> and fourscore <i>mille</i>: all these were <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i> of valour.
    </li>
    <li>And there <i>trolled</i> out against them Zerah the <i>schvartza</i> with an host of a <i>mille</i> <i>mille</i>, and <i>trey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>rattling coves</i>; and <i>trolled</i> unto Mareshah.
    </li>
    <li>Then Asa <i>trolled</i> out against <i>her</i>, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.
    </li>
    <li>And Asa <i>screeched</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i> <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, it is <i>nishter</i> with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i>; for we <i>lettie</i> on thee, and in thy name we <i>troll</i> against this multitude. O <i>Duchess</i>, thou art our <i>Gloria</i>; let no <i>homie</i> prevail against thee.
    </li>
    <li>So the <i>Duchess</i> <i>slapped</i> the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.
    </li>
    <li>And Asa and the <i>homies and palones</i> that were with <i>her</i> pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were <i>battyfanged</i> before the <i>Duchess</i>, and before <i>her</i> host; and they <i>lelled</i> away <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry</i> spoil.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>slapped</i> all the <i>smokes</i> round about Gerar; for the fear of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> upon them: and they spoiled all the <i>smokes</i>; for there was exceeding <i>dowry</i> spoil in them.
    </li>
    <li>They <i>slapped</i> also the <i>trolling letties</i> of cattle, and <i>lelled</i> away sheep and camels in abundance, and <i>trolled back to</i> Jerusalem.
    </li>

    <h2>Chapter 15</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And the <i>Fairy</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>trolled</i> upon Azariah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Oded:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> out to meet Asa, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>aunt nell</i> ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The <i>Duchess</i> is with you, while ye be with <i>her</i>; and if ye <i>charper</i> <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> will be found of you; but if ye forsake <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> will forsake you.
    </li>
    <li>Now for a long season Israel hath been <i>nanti</i> the true <i>Gloria</i>, and <i>nanti</i> a teaching <i>godly homie</i>, and <i>nanti</i> law.
    </li>
    <li>But when they in their trouble did turn unto the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, and sought <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> was found of them.
    </li>
    <li>And in those times there was no peace to <i>her</i> that <i>trolled</i> out, <i>nishta</i> to <i>her</i> that <i>trolled</i> in, but <i>dowry</i> vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries.
    </li>
    <li>And nation was <i>battyfanged</i> of nation, and <i>smoke</i> of <i>smoke</i>: for <i>Gloria</i> did vex them with all adversity.
    </li>
    <li>Be ye <i>butch</i> therefore, and let not your <i>fambles</i> be <i>nelly</i>: for your <i>acting dickey</i> shall be rewarded.
    </li>
    <li>And when Asa <i>aunt nelled</i> these <i>lavs</i>, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the <i>smokes</i> which <i>she</i> had <i>lelled</i> from mount Ephraim, and renewed the <i>grovelling fakement</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, that was before the porch of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to <i>her</i> out of Israel in abundance, when they <i>vardad</i> that the <i>Duchess</i> <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i> was with <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.
    </li>
    <li>And they offered unto the <i>Duchess</i> the same time, of the spoil which they had brought, <i>setter</i> <i>chenter</i> oxen and <i>setter</i> <i>mille</i> sheep.
    </li>
    <li>And they entered into a covenant to <i>charper</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of their <i>aunties</i> with all their <i>thumping cheat</i> and with all their <i>nishta lucoddy</i>;
    </li>
    <li>That whosoever would not <i>charper</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel should be put to <i>carking it</i>, whether <i>pogey</i> or <i>dowry</i>, whether <i>homie</i> or <i>palone</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they sware unto the <i>Duchess</i> with a loud <i>cackling fakement</i>, and with <i>screeching</i>, and with trumpets, and with cornets.
    </li>
    <li>And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their <i>thumping cheat</i>, and sought <i>her</i> with their whole <i>fancy</i>; and <i>she</i> was found of them: and the <i>Duchess</i> <i>parkered</i> them <i>lettie</i> round about.
    </li>
    <li>And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the <i>dowriest homie</i>, <i>she</i> removed her from being <i>dowriest palone</i>, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.
    </li>
    <li>But the high places were not <i>lelled</i> away out of Israel: <i>any road up</i> the <i>thumping cheat</i> of Asa was <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i> all <i>her</i> days.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> brought into the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> the <i>fakements</i> that <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> had dedicated, and that <i>she</i> himself had dedicated, silver, and <i>gelt</i>, and <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And there was <i>nishta</i> <i>barney</i> unto the <i>chinker</i> and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.
    </li>

    <h2>Chapter 16</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>In the <i>sey</i> and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel <i>trolled</i> up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that <i>she</i> might let none <i>troll out</i> or <i>troll</i> in to Asa <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah.
    </li>
    <li>Then Asa brought out silver and <i>gelt</i> out of the <i>gelt</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> and of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, and <i>laued</i> to Benhadad <i>dowriest homie</i> of Syria, that <i>letted</i> at Damascus, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my <i>Auntie</i> and thy <i>Auntie</i>: <i>varda</i>, I have <i>laued</i> thee silver and <i>gelt</i>; <i>troll</i>, break thy league with Baasha <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel, that <i>she</i> may <i>sling yer hook</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Benhadad <i>aunt nelled</i> unto <i>dowriest homie</i> Asa, and <i>laued</i> the captains of <i>her</i> armies against the <i>smokes</i> of Israel; and they <i>slapped</i> Ijon, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store <i>smokes</i> of Naphtali.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when Baasha <i>aunt nelled</i> it, that <i>she</i> <i>dry</i> off building of Ramah, and let <i>her</i> <i>acting dickey</i> cease.
    </li>
    <li>Then Asa the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>lelled</i> all Judah; and they <i>lelled</i> away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building; and <i>she</i> built therewith Geba and Mizpah.
    </li>
    <li>And at that time Hanani the seer <i>trolled</i> to Asa <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Because thou hast relied on the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Syria, and not relied on the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i>, therefore is the host of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Syria <i>scarpered</i> out of thine <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with <i>dowry</i> many <i>rattling coves</i> and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> them into thine <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>ogles</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself <i>butch</i> in the behalf of them whose <i>thumping cheat</i> is <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i> toward <i>her</i>. Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars.
    </li>
    <li>Then Asa was <i>dander</i> with the seer, and put <i>her</i> in a <i>charpering carsey</i> <i>lattie</i>; for <i>she</i> was in a rage with <i>her</i> because of this <i>fakement</i>. And Asa oppressed some of the <i>homies and palones</i> the same time.
    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Judah and Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And Asa in the <i>trey dacha</i> and ninth year of <i>her</i> reign was diseased in <i>her</i> <i>plates</i>, until <i>her</i> disease was exceeding <i>dowry</i>: yet in <i>her</i> disease <i>she</i> sought not to the <i>Duchess</i>, but to the physicians.
    </li>
    <li>And Asa <i>lettied</i> with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>, and <i>carked it</i> in the <i>una</i> and fortieth year of <i>her</i> reign.
    </li>
    <li>And they buried <i>her</i> in <i>her</i> own sepulchres, which <i>she</i> had made for himself in the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i>, and <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> in the bed which was filled with <i>bona</i> odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries&#8217; art: and they made a <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry</i> burning for <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 17</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And Jehoshaphat <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> reigned in <i>her</i> stead, and strengthened himself against Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> placed forces in all the fenced <i>smokes</i> of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the <i>smokes</i> of Ephraim, which Asa <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> had <i>lelled</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> was with Jehoshaphat, because <i>she</i> <i>minced</i> in the first ways of <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> <i>Davina</i>, and sought not unto Baalim;
    </li>
    <li>But sought to the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, and <i>minced</i> in <i>her</i> <i>butch lavs</i>, and not after the doings of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore the <i>Duchess</i> stablished the kingdom in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and <i>she</i> had riches and honour in abundance.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> was lifted up in the ways of the <i>Duchess</i>: moreover <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> away the high places and groves out of Judah.
    </li>
    <li>Also in the third year of <i>her</i> reign <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> to <i>her</i> <i>princesses</i>, even to Benhail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethaneel, and to Michaiah, to teach in the <i>smokes</i> of Judah.
    </li>
    <li>And with them <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, <i>godly homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they taught in Judah, and had the <i>glossy</i> of the law of the <i>Duchess</i> with them, and <i>trolled</i> about throughout all the <i>smokes</i> of Judah, and taught the <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the fear of the <i>Duchess</i> fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no <i>barney</i> against Jehoshaphat.
    </li>
    <li>Also some of the <i>naffs</i> brought Jehoshaphat presents, and tribute silver; and the Arabians brought <i>her</i> flocks, <i>setter</i> <i>mille</i> and <i>setter</i> <i>chenter</i> rams, and <i>setter</i> <i>mille</i> and <i>setter</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>she</i> goats.
    </li>
    <li>And Jehoshaphat waxed <i>dowry</i> exceedingly; and <i>she</i> built in Judah <i>butch latties</i>, and <i>smokes</i> of store.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> had <i>dowry</i> business in the <i>smokes</i> of Judah: and the <i>homies</i> of <i>barney</i>, <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i> of valour, were in Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And these are the numbers of them according to the <i>lattie</i> of their <i>aunties</i>: Of Judah, the captains of <i>milles</i>; Adnah the <i>dowriest</i>, and with <i>her</i> <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i> of valour <i>trey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>mille</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And next to <i>her</i> was Jehohanan the captain, and with <i>her</i> <i>dewey</i> <i>chenter</i> and fourscore <i>mille</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And next <i>her</i> was Amasiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Zichri, who willingly offered himself unto the <i>Duchess</i>; and with <i>her</i> <i>dewey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>mille</i> <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i> of valour.
    </li>
    <li>And of Benjamin; Eliada a <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homie</i> of valour, and with <i>her</i> armed <i>homies</i> with bow and shield <i>dewey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>mille</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And next <i>her</i> was Jehozabad, and with <i>her</i> an <i>chenter</i> and fourscore <i>mille</i> ready prepared for the <i>barney</i>.
    </li>
    <li>These waited on the <i>dowriest homie</i>, beside those whom the <i>dowriest homie</i> put in the fenced <i>smokes</i> throughout all Judah.

    <h2>Chapter 18</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined affinity with Ahab.
    </li>
    <li>And after certain years <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab <i>ferricadozad</i> sheep and oxen for <i>her</i> in abundance, and for the <i>homies and palones</i> that <i>she</i> had with <i>her</i>, and persuaded <i>her</i> to <i>troll</i> up with <i>her</i> to Ramothgilead.
    </li>
    <li>And Ahab <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel <i>cackled</i> unto Jehoshaphat <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, Wilt thou <i>troll</i> with me to Ramothgilead? And <i>she</i> answered <i>her</i>, I am as thou art, and my <i>homies and palones</i> as thy <i>homies and palones</i>; and we will be with thee in the <i>barney</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Jehoshaphat <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> to <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel gathered together of prophets <i>quarter</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>homies</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto them, Shall we <i>troll</i> to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they <i>cackled</i>, <i>troll</i> up; for <i>Gloria</i> will deliver it into the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But Jehoshaphat <i>cackled</i>, Is there not here a prophet of the <i>Duchess</i> besides, that we might enquire of <i>her</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel <i>cackled</i> unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet <i>una</i> <i>homie</i>, by whom we may enquire of the <i>Duchess</i>: but I hate <i>her</i>; for <i>she</i> never prophesied <i>bona</i> unto me, but always <i>nana</i>: the same is Micaiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Imla. And Jehoshaphat <i>cackled</i>, Let not the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackle</i> so.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel <i>screeched</i> for <i>una</i> of <i>her</i> <i>hilda handcuffs</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Fetch quickly Micaiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Imla.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel and Jehoshaphat <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah sat either of them on <i>her</i> throne, clothed in their <i>frocks</i>, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
    </li>
    <li>And Zedekiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Chenaanah had made <i>her</i> <i>colins</i> of iron, and <i>cackled</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, With these thou shalt push Syria until they be consumed.
    </li>
    <li>And all the prophets prophesied so, <i>cackling</i>, <i>troll</i> up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the <i>Duchess</i> shall deliver it into the <i>famble</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the messenger that <i>trolled</i> to <i>screech</i> Micaiah <i>cackled</i> to <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>varda</i>, the <i>lavs</i> of the prophets <i>screech</i> <i>bona</i> to the <i>dowriest homie</i> with <i>una</i> assent; let thy <i>lav</i> therefore, I pray thee, be like <i>una</i> of their&#8217;s, and <i>cackle</i> thou <i>bona</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Micaiah <i>cackled</i>, As the <i>Duchess</i> <i>letteth</i>, even what my <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackleth</i>, that will I <i>cackle</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> was <i>troll</i> to the <i>dowriest homie</i>, the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Micaiah, shall we <i>troll</i> to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>troll</i> ye up, and prosper, and they shall be <i>laued</i> into your <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i> to <i>her</i>, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou <i>cackle</i> <i>nishter</i> but the truth to me in the name of the <i>Duchess</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, I did <i>varda</i> all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i>, These have no master; let them return therefore every <i>homie</i> to <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i> in peace.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel <i>cackled</i> to Jehoshaphat, Did I not <i>cackle</i> thee that <i>she</i> would not prophesy <i>bona</i> unto me, but <i>nana</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Again <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Therefore <i>aunt nell</i> the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>; I <i>vardad</i> the <i>Duchess</i> sitting upon <i>her</i> throne, and all the host of heaven standing on <i>her</i> <i>sweet martini</i> and on <i>her</i> <i>dry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i>, Who shall entice Ahab <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel, that <i>she</i> may <i>troll</i> up and fall at Ramothgilead? And <i>una</i> <i>cackled</i> <i>cackling</i> after this manner, and another <i>cackling</i> after that manner.
    </li>
    <li>Then there <i>trolled</i> out a <i>Fairy</i>, and stood before the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, I will entice <i>her</i>. And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Wherewith?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, I will <i>troll out</i>, and be a lying <i>Fairy</i> in the <i>screech</i> of all <i>her</i> prophets. And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i>, Thou shalt entice <i>her</i>, and thou shalt also prevail: <i>troll out</i>, and do even so.
    </li>
    <li>Now therefore, <i>varda</i>, the <i>Duchess</i> hath put a lying <i>Fairy</i> in the <i>screech</i> of these thy prophets, and the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>cackled</i> <i>nana</i> against thee.
    </li>
    <li>Then Zedekiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Chenaanah <i>trolled</i> near, and <i>slapped</i> Micaiah upon the cheek, and <i>cackled</i>, Which way <i>trolled</i> the <i>Fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> from me to <i>cackle</i> unto thee?
    </li>
    <li>And Micaiah <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, thou shalt <i>varda</i> on that <i>journo</i> when thou shalt <i>troll</i> into an <i>back slum</i> to hide thyself.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel <i>cackled</i>, <i>lell</i> ye Micaiah, and carry <i>her</i> back to Amon the governor of the <i>smoke</i>, and to Joash the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>homie chavvie</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackle</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>, Put this fellow in the <i>charpering carsey</i>, and feed <i>her</i> with <i>pannan</i> of affliction and with <i>aqua</i> of affliction, until I return in peace.
    </li>
    <li>And Micaiah <i>cackled</i>, If thou <i>mais oui</i> return in peace, then hath not the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> by me. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>aunt nell</i>, all ye <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel and Jehoshaphat the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah <i>trolled</i> up to Ramothgilead.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel <i>cackled</i> unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and I will <i>troll</i> to the battle; but put thou on thy <i>frocks</i>. So the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel disguised himself; and they <i>trolled</i> to the battle.
    </li>
    <li>Now the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Syria had commanded the captains of the <i>rattling coves</i> that were with <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>palaver</i> ye not with <i>pogey</i> or <i>dowry</i>, save only with the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when the captains of the <i>rattling coves</i> <i>vardad</i> Jehoshaphat, that they <i>cackled</i>, It is the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel. Therefore they compassed about <i>her</i> to <i>palaver</i>: but Jehoshaphat <i>screeched</i> out, and the <i>Duchess</i> helped <i>her</i>; and <i>Gloria</i> <i>trolled</i> them to <i>troll off</i> from <i>her</i>.

    <li>And a certain <i>homie</i> drew a bow at a venture, and <i>slapped</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> to <i>her</i> <i>trundling cheat</i> <i>homie</i>, Turn thine <i>famble</i>, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.
    </li>
    <li>And the battle increased that <i>journo</i>: howbeit the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel stayed himself up in <i>her</i> <i>trundling cheat</i> against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the sun going down <i>she</i> <i>carked it</i>.

    <li>And Jehu the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Hanani the seer <i>trolled</i> out to meet <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i> to <i>dowriest homie</i> Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the <i>Duchess</i>? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> there are <i>bona</i> <i>fakements</i> found in thee, in that thou hast <i>lelled</i> away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thine <i>thumping cheat</i> to <i>charper</i> <i>Gloria</i>.

    <li>And Jehoshaphat <i>letted</i> at Jerusalem: and <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> out again through the <i>homies and palones</i> from Beersheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of their <i>aunties</i>.

    <li>Wherefore now let the fear of the <i>Duchess</i> be upon you; <i>lell</i> heed and do it: for there is no <i>codness</i> with the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i>, <i>nishta</i> respect of persons, <i>nishta</i> taking of gifts.

    </li>

    <li>And what cause soever shall <i>troll</i> to you of your <i>sisters</i> that <i>lett</i> in your <i>smokes</i>, between blood and blood, between law and <i>butch lav</i>, <i>dowry lavs</i> and judgments, ye shall even warn them that they <i>caterver</i> not against the <i>Duchess</i>, and so wrath <i>troll</i> upon you, and upon your <i>sisters</i>: this do, and <i>nanti</i> <i>caterver</i>.

    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>aunt nell</i> ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou <i>dowriest homie</i> Jehoshaphat, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> unto you, Be not afraid <i>nishta</i> dismayed by reason of this <i>dowry</i> multitude; for the battle is not yours, but <i>Gloria</i>&#8216;s.
    </li>
    <li>To morrow <i>troll</i> ye down against them: <i>varda</i>, they <i>troll</i> up by the cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook, before the <i>nishta smoke</i> of Jeruel.
    </li>
    <li><i>Nanti</i> need to <i>palaver</i> in this battle: set yourselves, stand ye still, and <i>varda</i> the salvation of the <i>Duchess</i> with you, O Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, <i>nishta</i> be dismayed; to morrow <i>troll out</i> against them: for the <i>Duchess</i> will be with you.
    </li>
    <li>And Jehoshaphat bowed <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> with <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> to the ground: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the <i>Duchess</i>, worshipping the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the Levites, of the <i>chavvies</i> of the Kohathites, and of the <i>chavvies</i> of the Korhites, stood up to praise the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel with a loud <i>cackling fakement</i> on high.
    </li>
    <li>And they rose early in the morning, and <i>trolled</i> forth into the <i>nishta smoke</i> of Tekoa: and as they <i>trolled</i> forth, Jehoshaphat stood and <i>cackled</i>, <i>aunt nell</i> me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i>, so shall ye be established; believe <i>her</i> prophets, so shall ye prosper.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> had consulted with the <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>she</i> appointed singers unto the <i>Duchess</i>, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they <i>trolled</i> out before the army, and to <i>cackle</i>, Praise the <i>Duchess</i>; for <i>her</i> mercy endureth for ever.
    </li>
    <li>And when they began to sing and to praise, the <i>Duchess</i> set ambushments against the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were <i>troll</i> against Judah; and they were smitten.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to <i>ferricadooza</i> and <i>battyfang</i> them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every <i>una</i> helped to <i>battyfang</i> another.
    </li>
    <li>And when Judah <i>trolled</i> toward the <i>varda</i> tower in the <i>nishta smoke</i>, they looked unto the multitude, and, <i>varda</i>, they were <i>stiff</i> bodies fallen to the earth, and none <i>scarpered</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when Jehoshaphat and <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i> <i>trolled</i> to <i>lell</i> away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the <i>stiff</i> bodies, and precious <i>groinage</i>, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were <i>trey</i> days in gathering of the spoil, it was so <i>dowry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And on the <i>quarter</i> <i>journo</i> they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah; for there they <i>fabed</i> the <i>Duchess</i>: therefore the name of the same place was <i>screeched</i>, The valley of Berachah, unto this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then they <i>trolled back</i>, every <i>homie</i> of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to <i>troll</i> again to Jerusalem with joy; for the <i>Duchess</i> had made them to rejoice over their enemies.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>trolled</i> to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the fear of <i>Gloria</i> was on all the kingdoms of those countries, when they had <i>aunt nelled</i> that the <i>Duchess</i> <i>palavered</i> against the enemies of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i> <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> <i>lettie</i> round about.
    </li>
    <li>And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: <i>she</i> was <i>trey dacha</i> and <i>chinker</i> years <i>badge</i> when <i>she</i> began to reign, and <i>she</i> reigned <i>dewey dacha</i> and <i>chinker</i> years in Jerusalem. And <i>her</i> mother&#8217;s name was Azubah the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Shilhi.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>minced</i> in the way of Asa <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, and <i>trolled off</i> not from it, doing that which was <i>sweet</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Howbeit the high places were not <i>lelled</i> away: for as yet the <i>homies and palones</i> had not prepared their <i>thumping cheats</i> unto the <i>Gloria</i> of their <i>aunties</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now the <i>lettie</i> of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, <i>varda</i>, they are <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of Jehu the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Hanani, who is mentioned in the <i>glossy</i> of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And after this did Jehoshaphat <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah join himself with Ahaziah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel, who did <i>dowry</i> wickedly:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> joined himself with <i>her</i> to make <i>latties on water</i> to <i>troll</i> to Tarshish: and they made the <i>latties on water</i> in Eziongaber.
    </li>
    <li>Then Eliezer the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, <i>cackling</i>, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the <i>Duchess</i> hath broken thy works. And the <i>latties on water</i> were broken, that they were not able to <i>troll</i> to Tarshish.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 21</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now Jehoshaphat <i>lettied</i> with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>, and was buried with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i> in the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i>. And Jehoram <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> reigned in <i>her</i> stead.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> had <i>sisters</i> the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these were the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Jehoshaphat <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And their <i>Auntie</i> <i>parkered</i> them <i>dowry</i> gifts of silver, and of <i>gelt</i>, and of precious <i>fakements</i>, with fenced <i>smokes</i> in Judah: but the kingdom <i>parkered</i> <i>she</i> to Jehoram; because <i>she</i> was the firstborn.
    </li>
    <li>Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, <i>she</i> strengthened himself, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> all <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i> with the <i>dowry efink</i>, and divers also of the <i>princesses</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>Jehoram was <i>trey dacha</i> and <i>dewey</i> years <i>badge</i> when <i>she</i> began to reign, and <i>she</i> reigned <i>say dooe</i> years in Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>minced</i> in the way of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Israel, like as did the <i>lattie</i> of Ahab: for <i>she</i> had the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Ahab to <i>palone affair</i>: and <i>she</i> wrought that which was <i>nana</i> in the <i>ogles</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Howbeit the <i>Duchess</i> would not <i>battyfang</i> the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Davina</i>, because of the covenant that <i>she</i> had made with <i>Davina</i>, and as <i>she</i> promised to <i>parker</i> a <i>sparkle</i> to <i>her</i> and to <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> for ever.
    </li>
    <li>In <i>her</i> days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah, and made themselves a <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then Jehoram <i>trolled</i> forth with <i>her</i> <i>princesses</i>, and all <i>her</i> <i>rattling coves</i> with <i>her</i>: and <i>she</i> rose up by <i>nochy</i>, and <i>slapped</i> the Edomites which compassed <i>her</i> in, and the captains of the <i>rattling coves</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So the Edomites revolted from under the <i>famble</i> of Judah unto this <i>journo</i>. The same time also did Libnah revolt from under <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>; because <i>she</i> had forsaken the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover <i>she</i> made high places in the mountains of Judah and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit <i>charvering</i>, and compelled Judah thereto.
    </li>
    <li>And there <i>trolled</i> a <i>screeving</i> to <i>her</i> from Elijah the prophet, <i>cackling</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of <i>Davina</i> thy <i>Auntie</i>, Because thou hast not <i>minced</i> in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy <i>Auntie</i>, <i>nishta</i> in the ways of Asa <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah,
    </li>
    <li>But hast <i>minced</i> in the way of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to <i>troll</i> a <i>bitaining</i>, like to the <i>bitainedoms</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of Ahab, and also hast <i>ferricadoozed</i> thy <i>sisters</i> of thy <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, which were <i>benar</i> than thyself:
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, with a <i>dowry</i> plague will the <i>Duchess</i> <i>slap</i> thy <i>homies and palones</i>, and thy <i>chavvies</i>, and thy <i>palone affairs</i>, and all thy goods:
    </li>
    <li>And thou shalt have <i>dowry</i> <i>kerterver coddy</i> by disease of thy <i>chutney locker</i>, until thy <i>chutney locker</i> fall out by reason of the <i>kerterver coddy</i> <i>journo</i> by <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover the <i>Duchess</i> stirred up against Jehoram the <i>Fairy</i> of the <i>naffs</i>, and of the Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians:
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>trolled</i> up into Judah, and brake into it, and <i>lelled</i> away all the substance that was found in the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> also, and <i>her</i> <i>palone affairs</i>; so that there was never a <i>homie chavvie</i> <i>dry</i> <i>her</i>, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And after all this the <i>Duchess</i> <i>slapped</i> <i>her</i> in <i>her</i> <i>chutney locker</i> with an incurable disease.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, that in process of time, after the end of <i>dewey</i> years, <i>her</i> <i>chutney locker</i> fell out by reason of <i>her</i> <i>kerterver coddy</i>: so <i>she</i> <i>carked it</i> of sore diseases. And <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i> made no burning for <i>her</i>, like the burning of <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Trey dacha</i> and <i>dewey</i> years <i>badge</i> was <i>she</i> when <i>she</i> began to reign, and <i>she</i> reigned in Jerusalem <i>say dooe</i> years, and <i>trolled off</i> <i>nanti</i> being <i>fancied</i>. Howbeit they buried <i>her</i> in the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i>, but not in the sepulchres of the <i>dowriest homies</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 22</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah <i>her</i> youngest <i>homie chavvie</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> in <i>her</i> stead: for the band of <i>homies</i> that <i>trolled</i> with the Arabians to the camp had <i>ferricadoozed</i> all the eldest. So Ahaziah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jehoram <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah reigned.
    </li>
    <li><i>Quarter dacha</i> and <i>dewey</i> years <i>badge</i> was Ahaziah when <i>she</i> began to reign, and <i>she</i> reigned <i>una</i> year in Jerusalem. <i>Her</i> mother&#8217;s name also was Athaliah the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Omri.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> also <i>minced</i> in the ways of the <i>lattie</i> of Ahab: for <i>her</i> mother was <i>her</i> counsellor to do wickedly.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore <i>she</i> did <i>nana</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> like the <i>lattie</i> of Ahab: for they were <i>her</i> counsellors after the <i>carking it</i> of <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> to <i>her</i> destruction.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> <i>minced</i> also after their counsel, and <i>trolled</i> with Jehoram the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ahab <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel to <i>barney</i> against Hazael <i>dowriest homie</i> of Syria at Ramothgilead: and the Syrians <i>slapped</i> Joram.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled back to</i> be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> at Ramah, when <i>she</i> <i>palavered</i> with Hazael <i>dowriest homie</i> of Syria. And Azariah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jehoram <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah <i>trolled</i> down to <i>varda</i> Jehoram the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ahab at Jezreel, because <i>she</i> was sick.
    </li>
    <li>And the destruction of Ahaziah was of <i>Gloria</i> by <i>trolling</i> to Joram: for when <i>she</i> was <i>troll</i>, <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> out with Jehoram against Jehu the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nimshi, whom the <i>Duchess</i> had anointed to cut off the <i>lattie</i> of Ahab.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the <i>lattie</i> of Ahab, and found the <i>princesses</i> of Judah, and the <i>homie chavvies</i> of the <i>sisters</i> of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, <i>she</i> <i>ferricadoozaed</i> them.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> sought Ahaziah: and they caught <i>her</i>, (for <i>she</i> was hid in Samaria,) and brought <i>her</i> to Jehu: and when they had <i>ferricadoozed</i> <i>her</i>, they buried <i>her</i>: Because, <i>cackled</i> they, <i>she</i> is the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jehoshaphat, who sought the <i>Duchess</i> with all <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>. So the <i>lattie</i> of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom.
    </li>
    <li>But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah <i>vardad</i> that her <i>homie chavvie</i> was <i>stiff</i>, she arose and <i>battyfanged</i> all the <i>maria</i> royal of the <i>lattie</i> of Judah.
    </li>
    <li>But Jehoshabeath, the <i>palone chavvie</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i>, <i>lelled</i> Joash the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ahaziah, and <i>sharpered</i> <i>her</i> from among the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>homie chavvies</i> that were <i>ferricadoozed</i>, and put <i>her</i> and <i>her</i> nurse in a <i>pallias</i>. So Jehoshabeath, the <i>palone chavvie</i> of <i>dowriest homie</i> Jehoram, the <i>palone affair</i> of Jehoiada the <i>godly homie</i>, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid <i>her</i> from Athaliah, so that she <i>ferricadoozaed</i> <i>her</i> not.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> was with them hid in the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>sey</i> years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 23</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And in the <i>setterth</i> year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and <i>lelled</i> the captains of <i>chenters</i>, Azariah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jeroham, and Ishmael the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jehohanan, and Azariah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Obed, and Maaseiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Zichri, into covenant with <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>trolled</i> about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the <i>smokes</i> of Judah, and the <i>dowriest</i> of the <i>aunties</i> of Israel, and they <i>trolled</i> to Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And all the <i>punters</i> made a covenant with the <i>dowriest homie</i> in the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>varda</i>, the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>homie chavvie</i> shall reign, as the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>cackled</i> of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of <i>Davina</i>.
    </li>
    <li>This is the <i>fakement</i> that ye shall do; A third part of you entering on the sabbath, of the <i>godly homies</i> and of the Levites, shall be porters of the doors;
    </li>
    <li>And a third part shall be at the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the <i>homies and palones</i> shall be in the courts of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But let none <i>troll</i> into the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, save the <i>godly homies</i>, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall <i>troll</i> in, for they are <i>fabulosa</i>: but all the <i>homies and palones</i> shall keep the <i>varda</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the Levites shall compass the <i>dowriest homie</i> round about, every <i>homie</i> with <i>her</i> weapons in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>; and whosoever else <i>trolleth</i> into the <i>lattie</i>, <i>she</i> shall be put to <i>carking it</i>: but be ye with the <i>dowriest homie</i> when <i>she</i> <i>trolleth</i> in, and when <i>she</i> goeth out.
    </li>
    <li>So the Levites and all Judah did according to all <i>fakements</i> that Jehoiada the <i>godly homie</i> had commanded, and <i>lelled</i> every <i>homie</i> <i>her</i> <i>homies</i> that were to <i>troll</i> in on the sabbath, with them that were to <i>troll out</i> on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the <i>godly homie</i> dismissed not the courses.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover Jehoiada the <i>godly homie</i> <i>laued</i> to the captains of <i>chenters</i> spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>Davina</i>&#8216;s, which were in the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> set all the <i>homies and palones</i>, every <i>homie</i> having <i>her</i> weapon in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>, from the <i>sweet</i> side of the <i>holy carsey</i> to the <i>dry</i> side of the <i>holy carsey</i>, along by the <i>grovelling fakement</i> and the <i>holy carsey</i>, by the <i>dowriest homie</i> round about.
    </li>
    <li>Then they brought out the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>homie chavvie</i>, and put upon <i>her</i> the <i>mudge</i>, and <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> the testimony, and made <i>her</i> <i>dowriest homie</i>. And Jehoiada and <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> anointed <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>Gloria</i> save the <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now when Athaliah <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>screech</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>trolling</i> and praising the <i>dowriest homie</i>, she <i>trolled</i> to the <i>homies and palones</i> into the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And she looked, and, <i>varda</i>, the <i>dowriest homie</i> stood at <i>her</i> pillar at the entering in, and the <i>princesses</i> and the trumpets by the <i>dowriest homie</i>: and all the <i>homies and palones</i> of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of musick, and such as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent her <i>zhoosh</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Treason, Treason.
    </li>
    <li>Then Jehoiada the <i>godly homie</i> brought out the captains of <i>chenters</i> that were set over the host, and <i>cackled</i> unto them, Have her forth of the ranges: and whoso followeth her, let <i>her</i> be <i>ferricadoozed</i> with the <i>dowry efink</i>. For the <i>godly homie</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>ferricadooza</i> her not in the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So they <i>laued</i> <i>fambles</i> on her; and when she was <i>troll</i> to the entering of the horse gate by the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, they <i>ferricadoozaed</i> her there.
    </li>
    <li>And Jehoiada made a covenant between <i>her</i>, and between all the <i>homies and palones</i>, and between the <i>dowriest homie</i>, that they should be the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then all the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>trolled</i> to the <i>lattie</i> of Baal, and brake it down, and brake <i>her</i> altars and <i>her</i> images in pieces, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> Mattan the <i>godly homie</i> of Baal before the altars.
    </li>
    <li>Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> by the <i>famble</i> of the <i>godly homies</i> the Levites, whom <i>Davina</i> had distributed in the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, to offer the burnt <i>parkerings</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, as it is <i>screeved</i> in the law of <i>Maureen</i>, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by <i>Davina</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> set the porters at the gates of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, that none which was <i>nanti sparkle</i> in any <i>fakement</i> should enter in.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> the captains of <i>chenters</i>, and the nobles, and the governors of the <i>homies and palones</i>, and all the <i>homies and palones</i> of the land, and brought down the <i>dowriest homie</i> from the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>: and they <i>trolled</i> through the high gate into the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, and set the <i>dowriest homie</i> upon the throne of the kingdom.
    </li>
    <li>And all the <i>homies and palones</i> of the land rejoiced: and the <i>smoke</i> was quiet, after that they had <i>ferricadoozed</i> Athaliah with the <i>dowry efink</i>.

    <h2>Chapter 24</h2>

    <li>Joash was <i>setter</i> years <i>badge</i> when <i>she</i> began to reign, and <i>she</i> reigned <i>quarter dacha</i> years in Jerusalem. <i>Her</i> mother&#8217;s name also was Zibiah of Beersheba.

    <li>And Joash did that which was <i>sweet</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> all the days of Jehoiada the <i>godly homie</i>.

    <li>And Jehoiada <i>lelled</i> for <i>her</i> <i>dewey</i> <i>palone affairs</i>; and <i>she</i> <i>chavvied</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> and <i>palone chavvies</i>.

    <li><i>Any road up</i> after this, that Joash was minded to repair the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.

    <li>And <i>she</i> gathered together the <i>godly homies</i> and the Levites, and <i>cackled</i> to them, <i>troll out</i> unto the <i>smokes</i> of Judah, and gather of all Israel <i>dinarly</i> to repair the <i>lattie</i> of your <i>Gloria</i> from year to year, and <i>varda</i> that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened it not.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>screeched</i> for Jehoiada the <i>dowriest</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to <i>parker</i> in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, according to the <i>butch lav</i> of <i>Maureen</i> the <i>serving homie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and of the <i>punters</i> of Israel, for the <i>bijou tabernaclette</i> of <i>varda-ing fakement</i>?
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Athaliah, that <i>naff</i> <i>palone</i>, had broken up the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>; and also all the dedicated <i>fakements</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> did they bestow upon Baalim.
    </li>
    <li>And at the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>butch lav</i> they made a chest, and set it <i>nanti</i> at the gate of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.

    <li>And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to <i>parker</i> in to the <i>Duchess</i> the collection that <i>Maureen</i> the <i>serving homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>laued</i> upon Israel in the <i>nishta smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And all the <i>princesses</i> and all the <i>homies and palones</i> rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.
    </li>
    <li>Now it <i>trolled</i> to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s office by the <i>famble</i> of the Levites, and when they <i>vardad</i> that there was <i>dowry</i> <i>dinarly</i>, the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s scribe and the high <i>godly homie</i>&#8216;s officer <i>trolled</i> and emptied the chest, and <i>lelled</i> it, and <i>lelled</i> it to <i>her</i> place again.

    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> and Jehoiada <i>parkered</i> it to such as did the <i>acting dickey</i> of the service of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So the workmen wrought, and the <i>acting dickey</i> was perfected by them, and they set the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> in <i>her</i> state, and strengthened it.
    </li>
    <li>And when they had finished it, they brought the <i>lettie</i> of the <i>dinarly</i> before the <i>dowriest homie</i> and Jehoiada, whereof were made <i>fakements</i> for the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, even <i>fakements</i> to minister, and to offer withal, and spoons, and <i>fakements</i> of <i>gelt</i> and silver. And they offered burnt <i>parkerings</i> in the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> continually all the days of Jehoiada.
    </li>
    <li>But Jehoiada waxed <i>badge</i>, and was full of days when <i>she</i> <i>carked it</i>; an <i>chenter</i> and <i>trey dacha</i> years <i>badge</i> was <i>she</i> when <i>she</i> <i>carked it</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they buried <i>her</i> in the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i> among the <i>dowriest homies</i>, because <i>she</i> had done <i>bona</i> in Israel, both toward <i>Gloria</i>, and toward <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now after the <i>carking it</i> of Jehoiada <i>trolled</i> the <i>princesses</i> of Judah, and made obeisance to the <i>dowriest homie</i>. Then the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> unto them.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>dry</i> the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of their <i>aunties</i>, and served groves and idols: and wrath <i>trolled</i> upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their <i>caterver</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Yet <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> prophets to them, to <i>parker</i> them again unto the <i>Duchess</i>; and they testified against them: but they would not <i>parker</i> <i>aunt nelling cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Fairy</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>trolled</i> upon Zechariah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jehoiada the <i>godly homie</i>, which stood above the <i>homies and palones</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto them, Thus <i>cackleth</i> <i>Gloria</i>, Why transgress ye the <i>butch lavs</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>she</i> hath also forsaken you.
    </li>
    <li>And they conspired against <i>her</i>, and stoned <i>her</i> with stones at the <i>butch lav</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> in the court of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thus Joash the <i>dowriest homie</i> remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> had done to <i>her</i>, but <i>ferricadoozaed</i> <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>. And when <i>she</i> <i>carked it</i>, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, The <i>Duchess</i> <i>varda</i> upon it, and require it.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> at the end of the year, that the host of Syria <i>trolled</i> up against <i>her</i>: and they <i>trolled</i> to Judah and Jerusalem, and <i>battyfanged</i> all the <i>princesses</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i> from among the <i>homies and palones</i>, and <i>laued</i> all the spoil of them unto the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Damascus.
    </li>
    <li>For the army of the Syrians <i>trolled</i> with a <i>pogey</i> company of <i>homies</i>, and the <i>Duchess</i> <i>laued</i> a <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry</i> host into their <i>famble</i>, because they had forsaken the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of their <i>aunties</i>. So they executed judgment against Joash.
    </li>
    <li>And when they were <i>trolled off</i> from <i>her</i>, (for they <i>dry</i> <i>her</i> in <i>dowry</i> diseases,) <i>her</i> own <i>serving homies</i> conspired against <i>her</i> for the blood of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Jehoiada the <i>godly homie</i>, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> <i>her</i> on <i>her</i> bed, and <i>she</i> <i>carked it</i>: and they buried <i>her</i> in the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i>, but they buried <i>her</i> not in the sepulchres of the <i>dowriest homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And these are they that conspired against <i>her</i>; Zabad the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Shimrith a Moabitess.
    </li>
    <li>Now concerning <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>, and the <i>dowriness</i> of the burdens <i>laued</i> upon <i>her</i>, and the repairing of the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, <i>varda</i>, they are <i>screeved</i> in the story of the <i>glossy</i> of the <i>dowriest homies</i>. And Amaziah <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> reigned in <i>her</i> stead.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 25</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Amaziah was <i>dewey dacha</i> and <i>chinker</i> years <i>badge</i> when <i>she</i> began to reign, and <i>she</i> reigned <i>dewey dacha</i> and <i>sey trey</i> years in Jerusalem. And <i>her</i> mother&#8217;s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> did that which was <i>sweet</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, but not with a <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now it <i>trolled</i> to pass, when the kingdom was established to <i>her</i>, that <i>she</i> <i>ferricadoozaed</i> <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i> that had <i>ferricadozad</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> <i>ferricadoozaed</i> not their <i>chavvies</i>, but did as it is <i>screeved</i> in the law in the <i>glossy</i> of <i>Maureen</i>, where the <i>Duchess</i> commanded, <i>cackling</i>, The <i>aunties</i> shall not <i>cark it</i> for the <i>chavvies</i>, <i>nishta</i> shall the <i>chavvies</i> <i>cark it</i> for the <i>aunties</i>, but every <i>homie</i> shall <i>cark it</i> for <i>her</i> own <i>kertever</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over <i>milles</i>, and captains over <i>chenters</i>, according to the <i>latties</i> of their <i>aunties</i>, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and <i>she</i> numbered them from <i>dewey dacha</i> years <i>badge</i> and above, and found them <i>trey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>mille</i> choice <i>homies</i>, able to <i>troll forth</i> to <i>barney</i>, that could handle spear and shield.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> hired also an <i>chenter</i> <i>mille</i> <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i> of valour out of Israel for an <i>chenter</i> talents of silver.
    </li>
    <li>But there <i>trolled</i> a <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> to <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, O <i>dowriest homie</i>, let not the army of Israel <i>troll</i> with thee; for the <i>Duchess</i> is not with Israel, to wit, with all the <i>chavvies</i> of Ephraim.
    </li>
    <li>But if thou wilt <i>troll</i>, do it; be <i>butch</i> for the battle: <i>Gloria</i> shall make thee fall before the enemy: for <i>Gloria</i> hath power to help, and to cast down.
    </li>
    <li>And Amaziah <i>cackled</i> to the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, But what shall we do for the <i>chenter</i> talents which I have <i>parkered</i> to the army of Israel? And the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> answered, The <i>Duchess</i> is able to <i>parker</i> thee <i>dowry</i> more than this.
    </li>
    <li>Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was <i>troll</i> to <i>her</i> out of Ephraim, to <i>troll</i> home again: wherefore their <i>wild</i> was greatly kindled against Judah, and they <i>trolled back</i> home in <i>dowry</i> <i>wild</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, and <i>trolled</i> to the valley of salt, and <i>slapped</i> of the <i>chavvies</i> of Seir <i>dacha</i> <i>mille</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And other <i>dacha</i> <i>mille</i> <i>dry</i> alive did the <i>chavvies</i> of Judah carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>butch homies</i> of the army which Amaziah <i>laued</i> back, that they should not <i>troll</i> with <i>her</i> to battle, fell upon the <i>smokes</i> of Judah, from Samaria even unto Bethhoron, and <i>slapped</i> <i>trey</i> <i>mille</i> of them, and <i>lelled</i> <i>dowry</i> spoil.
    </li>
    <li>Now it <i>trolled</i> to pass, after that Amaziah was <i>troll</i> from the slaughter of the Edomites, that <i>she</i> brought the gods of the <i>chavvies</i> of Seir, and set them up to be <i>her</i> gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned <i>smelly</i> unto them.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore the <i>wild</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> was kindled against Amaziah, and <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> unto <i>her</i> a prophet, which <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the <i>homies and palones</i>, which could not deliver their own <i>homies and palones</i> out of thine <i>famble</i>?
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, as <i>she</i> talked with <i>her</i>, that the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Art thou made of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and <i>cackled</i>, I know that <i>Gloria</i> hath determined to <i>battyfang</i> thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not <i>aunt nelled</i> unto my counsel.
    </li>
    <li>Then Amaziah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah <i>lelled</i> advice, and <i>laued</i> to Joash, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jehoahaz, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jehu, <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel, <i>cackling</i>, <i>troll</i>, let us <i>varda</i> <i>una</i> another in the <i>eke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Joash <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel <i>laued</i> to Amaziah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, <i>cackling</i>, The thistle that was in Lebanon <i>laued</i> to the cedar that was in Lebanon, <i>cackling</i>, <i>parker</i> thy <i>palone chavvie</i> to my <i>homie chavvie</i> to <i>palone affair</i>: and there <i>trolled by</i> a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.
    </li>
    <li>Thou <i>cackleth</i>, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine <i>thumping cheat</i> lifteth thee up to boast: <i>lett</i> now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?
    </li>
    <li>But Amaziah would not <i>aunt nell</i>; for it <i>trolled</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, that <i>she</i> might deliver them into the <i>famble</i> of their enemies, because they sought after the gods of Edom.
    </li>
    <li>So Joash the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel <i>trolled</i> up; and they <i>vardad</i> <i>una</i> another in the <i>eke</i>, both <i>she</i> and Amaziah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, at Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah.
    </li>
    <li>And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every <i>homie</i> to <i>her</i> <i>trolling lettie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Joash the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel <i>lelled</i> Amaziah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Joash, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought <i>her</i> to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, <i>quarter</i> <i>chenter</i> cubits.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> all the <i>gelt</i> and the silver, and all the <i>fakements</i> that were found in the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> with Obededom, and the <i>gelt</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, the hostages also, and <i>trolled back to</i> Samaria.
    </li>
    <li>And Amaziah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Joash <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah lived after the <i>carking it</i> of Joash <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jehoahaz <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel fifteen years.
    </li>
    <li>Now the <i>lettie</i> of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, <i>varda</i>, are they not <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Judah and Israel?
    </li>
    <li>Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the <i>Duchess</i> they made a conspiracy against <i>her</i> in Jerusalem; and <i>she</i> fled to Lachish: but they <i>laued</i> to Lachish after <i>her</i>, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> <i>her</i> there.
    </li>
    <li>And they brought <i>her</i> upon horses, and buried <i>her</i> with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i> in the <i>smoke</i> of Judah.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 26</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Then all the <i>homies and palones</i> of Judah <i>lelled</i> Uzziah, who was sixteen years <i>badge</i>, and made <i>her</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> in the room of <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> Amaziah.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>lettied</i> with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Sixteen years <i>badge</i> was Uzziah when <i>she</i> began to reign, and <i>she</i> reigned <i>chinker dacha</i> and <i>dewey</i> years in Jerusalem. <i>Her</i> mother&#8217;s name also was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> did that which was <i>sweet</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, according to all that <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> Amaziah did.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> sought <i>Gloria</i> in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of <i>Gloria</i>: and as long as <i>she</i> sought the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>Gloria</i> made <i>her</i> to prosper.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> forth and warred against the <i>naffs</i>, and brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built <i>smokes</i> about Ashdod, and among the <i>naffs</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Gloria</i> helped <i>her</i> against the <i>naffs</i>, and against the Arabians that <i>letted</i> in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims.
    </li>
    <li>And the Ammonites <i>parkered</i> gifts to Uzziah: and <i>her</i> name spread abroad even to the entering in of Egypt; for <i>she</i> strengthened himself exceedingly.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them.
    </li>
    <li>Also <i>she</i> built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for <i>she</i> had <i>dowry</i> cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains: husbandmen also, and vine dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel: for <i>she</i> loved husbandry.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting <i>homies</i>, that <i>trolled</i> out to <i>barney</i> by bands, according to the number of their account by the <i>famble</i> of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the <i>famble</i> of Hananiah, <i>una</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s captains.
    </li>
    <li>The whole number of the <i>dowriest</i> of the <i>aunties</i> of the <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i> of valour were <i>dewey</i> <i>mille</i> and <i>sey</i> <i>chenter</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And under their <i>famble</i> was an army, <i>trey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>mille</i> and <i>setter</i> <i>mille</i> and <i>chinker</i> <i>chenter</i>, that made <i>barney</i> with <i>dowry butch</i> power, to help the <i>dowriest homie</i> against the enemy.
    </li>
    <li>And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast stones.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning <i>homies</i>, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and <i>dowry</i> stones withal. And <i>her</i> name spread far abroad; for <i>she</i> was marvellously helped, till <i>she</i> was <i>butch</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But when <i>she</i> was <i>butch</i>, <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> was lifted up to <i>her</i> destruction: for <i>she</i> transgressed against the <i>Duchess</i> <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i>, and <i>trolled</i> into the <i>holy carsey</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> to burn <i>smelly</i> upon the <i>grovelling fakement</i> of <i>smelly</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Azariah the <i>godly homie</i> <i>trolled</i> in after <i>her</i>, and with <i>her</i> fourscore <i>godly homies</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, that were valiant <i>homies</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And they withstood Uzziah the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, It appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn <i>smelly</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>, but to the <i>godly homies</i> the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn <i>smelly</i>: <i>troll out</i> of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; <i>nishta</i> shall it be for thine honour from the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then Uzziah was <i>dander</i>, and had a censer in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> to burn <i>smelly</i>: and while <i>she</i> was <i>dander</i> with the <i>godly homies</i>, the leprosy even rose up in <i>her</i> forehead before the <i>godly homies</i> in the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, from beside the <i>smelly</i> <i>grovelling fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Azariah the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homie</i>, and all the <i>godly homies</i>, looked upon <i>her</i>, and, <i>varda</i>, <i>she</i> was leprous in <i>her</i> forehead, and they thrust <i>her</i> out from thence; <i>any road up</i>, himself hasted also to <i>troll out</i>, because the <i>Duchess</i> had smitten <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Uzziah the <i>dowriest homie</i> was a leper unto the <i>journo</i> of <i>her</i> <i>carking it</i>, and <i>letted</i> in a several <i>lattie</i>, being a leper; for <i>she</i> was cut off from the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>: and Jotham <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> was over the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, judging the <i>homies and palones</i> of the land.
    </li>
    <li>Now the <i>lettie</i> of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Amoz, <i>screeve</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So Uzziah <i>lettied</i> with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>, and they buried <i>her</i> with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i> in the field of the burial which belonged to the <i>dowriest homies</i>; for they <i>cackled</i>, <i>she</i> is a leper: and Jotham <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> reigned in <i>her</i> stead.

    <h2>Chapter 27</h2>

    <li>Jotham was <i>dewey dacha</i> and <i>chinker</i> years <i>badge</i> when <i>she</i> began to reign, and <i>she</i> reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. <i>Her</i> mother&#8217;s name also was Jerushah, the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Zadok.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> did that which was <i>sweet</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, according to all that <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> Uzziah did: howbeit <i>she</i> entered not into the <i>holy carsey</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>. And the <i>homies and palones</i> did yet corruptly.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> built the high gate of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and on the wall of Ophel <i>she</i> built <i>dowry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover <i>she</i> built <i>smokes</i> in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests <i>she</i> built <i>butch latties</i> and towers.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> <i>palavered</i> also with the <i>dowriest homie</i> of the Ammonites, and prevailed against them. And the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> the same year an <i>chenter</i> talents of silver, and <i>dacha</i> <i>mille</i> measures of wheat, and <i>dacha</i> <i>mille</i> of barley.

    <li>Now the <i>lettie</i> of the acts of Jotham, and all <i>her</i> wars, and <i>her</i> ways, lo, they are <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Israel and Judah.

    <h2>Chapter 28</h2>

    <li>Ahaz was <i>dewey dacha</i> years <i>badge</i> when <i>she</i> began to reign, and <i>she</i> reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: but <i>she</i> did not that which was <i>sweet</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, like <i>Davina</i> <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> <i>minced</i> in the ways of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Israel, and made also molten images for Baalim.

    <li>Moreover <i>she</i> burnt <i>smelly</i> in the valley of the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Hinnom, and burnt <i>her</i> <i>chavvies</i> in the <i>binco fakement</i>, after the <i>dowry cods</i> of the heathen whom the <i>Duchess</i> had cast out before the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> sacrificed also and burnt <i>smelly</i> in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.

    <li>Wherefore the <i>Duchess</i> <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i> <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> into the <i>famble</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Syria; and they <i>slapped</i> <i>her</i>, and <i>lelled</i> away a <i>dowry</i> multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus. And <i>she</i> was also <i>laued</i> into the <i>famble</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel, who <i>slapped</i> <i>her</i> with a <i>dowry</i> slaughter.
    </li>
    <li>For Pekah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Remaliah <i>ferricadoozaed</i> in Judah an <i>chenter</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i> <i>mille</i> in <i>una</i> <i>journo</i>, which were all valiant <i>homies</i>; because they had forsaken the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of their <i>aunties</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Zichri, a <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homie</i> of Ephraim, <i>ferricadoozaed</i> Maaseiah the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>homie chavvie</i>, and Azrikam the governor of the <i>lattie</i>, and Elkanah that was next to the <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>lelled</i> away captive of their <i>sisters</i> <i>dewey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>mille</i>, <i>palones</i>, <i>homie chavvies</i>, and <i>palone chavvies</i>, and <i>lelled</i> also away <i>dowry</i> spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.
    </li>
    <li>But a prophet of the <i>Duchess</i> was there, whose name was Oded: and <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> out before the host that <i>trolled</i> to Samaria, and <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>varda</i>, because the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of your <i>aunties</i> was <i>dander</i> with Judah, <i>she</i> hath <i>laued</i> them into your <i>famble</i>, and ye have <i>ferricadoozed</i> them in a rage that reacheth up unto heaven.
    </li>
    <li>And now ye purpose to keep under the <i>chavvies</i> of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there not with you, even with you, <i>kertervers</i> against the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Now <i>aunt nell</i> me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which ye have <i>lelled</i> captive of your <i>sisters</i>: for the fierce wrath of the <i>Duchess</i> is upon you.
    </li>
    <li>Then certain of the <i>ekes</i> of the <i>chavvies</i> of Ephraim, Azariah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Johanan, Berechiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Shallum, and Amasa the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Hadlai, stood up against them that <i>trolled</i> from the <i>barney</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>nanti</i> <i>parker</i> in the captives hither: for whereas we have offended against the <i>Duchess</i> already, ye intend to add more to our <i>kertervers</i> and to our <i>caterver</i>: for our <i>caterver</i> is <i>dowry</i>, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.

    <li>So the armed <i>homies</i> <i>dry</i> the captives and the spoil before the <i>princesses</i> and all the <i>punters</i>.

    <li>And the <i>homies</i> which were expressed by name rose up, and <i>lelled</i> the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were <i>nanti zhoosh</i> among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and <i>parkered</i> them to <i>jarry</i> and to <i>buvare</i>, and anointed them, and <i>lelled</i> all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the <i>smoke</i> of palm trees, to their <i>sisters</i>: then they <i>trolled back to</i> Samaria.
    </li>
    <li>At that time did <i>dowriest homie</i> Ahaz <i>lau</i> unto the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Assyria to help <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For again the Edomites had <i>troll</i> and smitten Judah, and <i>lelled</i> away captives.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>naffs</i> also had invaded the <i>smokes</i> of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had <i>lelled</i> Bethshemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and they <i>letted</i> there.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>Duchess</i> brought Judah low because of Ahaz <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel; for <i>she</i> made Judah <i>nanti zhoosh</i>, and transgressed sore against the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Tilgathpilneser <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria <i>trolled</i> unto <i>her</i>, and distressed <i>her</i>, but strengthened <i>her</i> not.
    </li>
    <li>For Ahaz <i>lelled</i> away a portion out of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and out of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and of the <i>princesses</i>, and <i>parkered</i> it unto the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria: but <i>she</i> helped <i>her</i> not.
    </li>
    <li>And in the time of <i>her</i> distress did <i>she</i> <i>caterver</i> yet more against the <i>Duchess</i>: this is that <i>dowriest homie</i> Ahaz.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which <i>slapped</i> <i>her</i>: and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Because the gods of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Syria help them, therefore will I <i>parker</i> to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of <i>her</i>, and of all Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And Ahaz gathered together the <i>fakements</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and cut in pieces the <i>fakements</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and shut up the doors of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>she</i> made <i>her</i> altars in every corner of Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And in every several <i>smoke</i> of Judah <i>she</i> made high places to burn <i>smelly</i> unto other gods, and provoked to <i>wild</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now the <i>lettie</i> of <i>her</i> acts and of all <i>her</i> ways, first and last, <i>varda</i>, they are <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Judah and Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And Ahaz <i>lettied</i> with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>, and they buried <i>her</i> in the <i>smoke</i>, even in Jerusalem: but they brought <i>her</i> not into the sepulchres of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Israel: and Hezekiah <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> reigned in <i>her</i> stead.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 29</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Hezekiah began to reign when <i>she</i> was <i>chinker</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i> years <i>badge</i>, and <i>she</i> reigned <i>sey trey</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i> years in Jerusalem. And <i>her</i> mother&#8217;s name was Abijah, the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Zechariah.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> did that which was <i>sweet</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, according to all that <i>Davina</i> <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> had done.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> in the first year of <i>her</i> reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and repaired them.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> brought in the <i>godly homies</i> and the Levites, and gathered them together into the east street,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>aunt nell</i> me, ye Levites, <i>bonafy</i> now yourselves, and <i>bonafy</i> the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of your <i>aunties</i>, and carry forth the filthiness out of the <i>fabulosa</i> place.
    </li>
    <li>For our <i>aunties</i> have trespassed, and done that which was <i>nana</i> in the <i>ogles</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i>, and have forsaken <i>her</i>, and have turned away their <i>ekes</i> from the habitation of the <i>Duchess</i>, and turned their backs.
    </li>
    <li>Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the <i>bincos</i>, and have not burned <i>smelly</i> <i>nishta</i> offered burnt <i>parkerings</i> in the <i>fabulosa</i> place unto the <i>Gloria</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore the wrath of the <i>Duchess</i> was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and <i>she</i> hath <i>laued</i> them to trouble, to <i>gobsmacked-ness</i>, and to hissing, as ye <i>varda</i> with your <i>ogles</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For, lo, our <i>aunties</i> have fallen by the <i>dowry efink</i>, and our <i>homie chavvies</i> and our <i>palone chavvies</i> and our <i>palone affairs</i> are in captivity for this.
    </li>
    <li>Now it is in mine <i>thumping cheat</i> to make a covenant with the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, that <i>her</i> fierce wrath may turn away from us.
    </li>
    <li>My <i>homie chavvies</i>, be not now negligent: for the <i>Duchess</i> hath chosen you to stand before <i>her</i>, to serve <i>her</i>, and that ye should minister unto <i>her</i>, and burn <i>smelly</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then the Levites arose, Mahath the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Amasai, and Joel the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Azariah, of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of the Kohathites: and of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Merari, Kish the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Abdi, and Azariah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites; Joah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Zimmah, and Eden the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Joah:
    </li>
    <li>And of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah:
    </li>
    <li>And of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel.
    </li>
    <li>And they gathered their <i>sisters</i>, and sanctified themselves, and <i>trolled</i>, according to the <i>butch lav</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i>, by the <i>lavs</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, to cleanse the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>godly homies</i> <i>trolled</i> into the inner part of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, to cleanse it, and brought out all the <i>nishta sparkle</i> that they found in the <i>holy carsey</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> into the court of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>. And the Levites <i>lelled</i> it, to carry it out abroad into the brook Kidron.
    </li>
    <li>Now they began on the first <i>journo</i> of the first month to <i>bonafy</i>, and on the <i>otterth</i> <i>journo</i> of the month <i>trolled</i> they to the porch of the <i>Duchess</i>: so they sanctified the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> in <i>say dooe</i> days; and in the sixteenth <i>journo</i> of the first month they made an end.
    </li>
    <li>Then they <i>trolled</i> in to Hezekiah the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, We have cleansed all the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and the <i>grovelling fakement</i> of burnt <i>parkering</i>, with all the <i>fakements</i> thereof, and the shewbread table, with all the <i>fakements</i> thereof.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover all the <i>fakements</i>, which <i>dowriest homie</i> Ahaz in <i>her</i> reign did cast away in <i>her</i> transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and, <i>varda</i>, they are before the <i>grovelling fakement</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then Hezekiah the <i>dowriest homie</i> rose early, and gathered the rulers of the <i>smoke</i>, and <i>trolled</i> up to the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they brought <i>setter</i> bullocks, and <i>setter</i> rams, and <i>setter</i> lambs, and <i>setter</i> <i>she</i> goats, for a <i>kertever</i> <i>parkering</i> for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And <i>she</i> commanded the <i>godly homies</i> the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Aaron to offer them on the <i>grovelling fakement</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So they <i>ferricadozad</i> the bullocks, and the <i>godly homies</i> <i>lalled</i> the blood, and sprinkled it on the <i>grovelling fakement</i>: likewise, when they had <i>ferricadozad</i> the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the <i>grovelling fakement</i>: they <i>ferricadozad</i> also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the <i>grovelling fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they brought forth the <i>she</i> goats for the <i>kertever</i> <i>parkering</i> before the <i>dowriest homie</i> and the <i>punters</i>; and they <i>laued</i> their <i>fambles</i> upon them:
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>godly homies</i> <i>ferricadozad</i> them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the <i>grovelling fakement</i>, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the <i>dowriest homie</i> commanded that the burnt <i>parkering</i> and the <i>kertever</i> <i>parkering</i> should be made for all Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> set the Levites in the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the <i>butch lav</i> of <i>Davina</i>, and of Gad the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s seer, and Nathan the prophet: for so was the <i>butch lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> by <i>her</i> prophets.
    </li>
    <li>And the Levites stood with the instruments of <i>Davina</i>, and the <i>godly homies</i> with the trumpets.
    </li>
    <li>And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt <i>parkering</i> upon the <i>grovelling fakement</i>. And when the burnt <i>parkering</i> began, the <i>chant</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> began also with the trumpets, and with the instruments ordained by <i>Davina</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And all the <i>punters</i> worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until the burnt <i>parkering</i> was finished.
    </li>
    <li>And when they had made an end of <i>parkering</i>, the <i>dowriest homie</i> and all that were present with <i>her</i> bowed themselves, and worshipped.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover Hezekiah the <i>dowriest homie</i> and the <i>princesses</i> commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the <i>Duchess</i> with the <i>lavs</i> of <i>Davina</i>, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their <i>ekes</i> and worshipped.
    </li>
    <li>Then Hezekiah answered and <i>cackled</i>, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>troll</i> near and <i>parker</i> <i>parkers</i> and thank <i>parkerings</i> into the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>. And the <i>punters</i> brought in <i>parkers</i> and thank <i>parkerings</i>; and as many as were of a free <i>thumping cheat</i> burnt <i>parkerings</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the number of the burnt <i>parkerings</i>, which the <i>punters</i> brought, was <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> and <i>dacha</i> bullocks, an <i>chenter</i> rams, and <i>dewey</i> <i>chenter</i> lambs: all these were for a burnt <i>parkering</i> to the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the consecrated <i>fakements</i> were <i>sey</i> <i>chenter</i> oxen and <i>trey</i> <i>mille</i> sheep.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>godly homies</i> were too <i>nishta dowry</i>, so that they could not flay all the burnt <i>parkerings</i>: wherefore their <i>sisters</i> the Levites did help them, till the <i>acting dickey</i> was ended, and until the other <i>godly homies</i> had sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more upright in <i>thumping cheat</i> to <i>bonafy</i> themselves than the <i>godly homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And also the burnt <i>parkerings</i> were in abundance, with the fat of the peace <i>parkerings</i>, and the <i>buvare</i> <i>parkerings</i> for every burnt <i>parkering</i>. So the service of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> was set in order.
    </li>
    <li>And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the <i>homies and palones</i>, that <i>Gloria</i> had prepared the <i>homies and palones</i>: for the <i>fakement</i> was done suddenly.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 30</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And Hezekiah <i>laued</i> to all Israel and Judah, and <i>screeved</i> letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should <i>troll</i> to the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> at Jerusalem, to keep the <i>trollover</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>dowriest homie</i> had <i>lelled</i> counsel, and <i>her</i> <i>princesses</i>, and all the <i>punters</i> in Jerusalem, to keep the <i>trollover</i> in the second month.
    </li>
    <li>For they could not keep it at that time, because the <i>godly homies</i> had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, <i>nishta</i> had the <i>homies and palones</i> gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>fakement</i> pleased the <i>dowriest homie</i> and all the <i>punters</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should <i>troll</i> to keep the <i>trollover</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was <i>screeved</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So the posts <i>trolled</i> with the letters from the <i>dowriest homie</i> and <i>her</i> <i>princesses</i> throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the <i>butch lav</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Ye <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, turn again unto the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and <i>she</i> will <i>troll back to</i> the remnant of you, that are <i>scarpered</i> out of the <i>famble</i> of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Assyria.
    </li>
    <li>And be not ye like your <i>aunties</i>, and like your <i>sisters</i>, which trespassed against the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of their <i>aunties</i>, who therefore <i>parkered</i> them up to desolation, as ye <i>varda</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your <i>aunties</i> were, but yield yourselves unto the <i>Duchess</i>, and enter into <i>her</i> sanctuary, which <i>she</i> hath sanctified for ever: and serve the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i>, that the fierceness of <i>her</i> wrath may turn away from you.
    </li>
    <li>For if ye turn again unto the <i>Duchess</i>, your <i>sisters</i> and your <i>chavvies</i> shall find compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall <i>troll</i> again into this land: for the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i> is <i>bona</i> and merciful, and will not turn away <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> from you, if ye return unto <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So the posts passed from <i>smoke</i> to <i>smoke</i> through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they <i>tittered</i> them to scorn, and mocked them.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and <i>trolled</i> to Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>Also in Judah the <i>famble</i> of <i>Gloria</i> was to <i>parker</i> them <i>una</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> to do the <i>butch lav</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> and of the <i>princesses</i>, by the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And there assembled at Jerusalem <i>dowry</i> <i>homies and palones</i> to keep the <i>dowry munjarlee</i> of unleavened <i>pannan</i> in the second month, a <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry</i> <i>punters</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they arose and <i>lelled</i> away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for <i>smelly</i> <i>lelled</i> they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron.
    </li>
    <li>Then they <i>ferricadozad</i> the <i>trollover</i> on the fourteenth <i>journo</i> of the second month: and the <i>godly homies</i> and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt <i>parkerings</i> into the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of <i>Maureen</i> the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>: the <i>godly homies</i> sprinkled the blood, which they <i>lalled</i> of the <i>famble</i> of the Levites.
    </li>
    <li>For there were many in the <i>punters</i> that were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every <i>una</i> that was not clean, to <i>bonafy</i> them unto the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For a multitude of the <i>homies and palones</i>, even many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they <i>jarry</i> the <i>trollover</i> otherwise than it was <i>screeved</i>. But Hezekiah prayed for them, <i>cackling</i>, The <i>bona</i> <i>Duchess</i> pardon every <i>una</i>
    </li>
    <li>That prepareth <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> to <i>charper</i> <i>Gloria</i>, the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>, though <i>she</i> be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> to Hezekiah, and healed the <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the <i>dowry munjarlee</i> of unleavened <i>pannan</i> <i>setter</i> days with <i>dowry</i> gladness: and the Levites and the <i>godly homies</i> praised the <i>Duchess</i> <i>journo</i> by <i>journo</i>, singing with loud instruments unto the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Hezekiah <i>cackled</i> comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the <i>bona</i> knowledge of the <i>Duchess</i>: and they did <i>jarry</i> throughout the <i>dowry munjarlee</i> <i>setter</i> days, <i>parkering</i> peace <i>parkerings</i>, and making confession to the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of their <i>aunties</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the whole assembly <i>lelled</i> counsel to keep other <i>setter</i> days: and they kept other <i>setter</i> days with gladness.
    </li>
    <li>For Hezekiah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah did <i>parker</i> to the <i>punters</i> a <i>mille</i> bullocks and <i>setter</i> <i>mille</i> sheep; and the <i>princesses</i> <i>parkered</i> to the <i>punters</i> a <i>mille</i> bullocks and <i>dacha</i> <i>mille</i> sheep: and a <i>dowry</i> number of <i>godly homies</i> sanctified themselves.
    </li>
    <li>And all the <i>punters</i> of Judah, with the <i>godly homies</i> and the Levites, and all the <i>punters</i> that <i>trolled</i> out of Israel, and the strangers that <i>trolled</i> out of the land of Israel, and that <i>letted</i> in Judah, rejoiced.
    </li>
    <li>So there was <i>dowry</i> joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>Davina</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>godly homies</i> the Levites arose and <i>fabed</i> the <i>homies and palones</i>: and their <i>cackling fakement</i> was <i>aunt nelled</i>, and their <i>meshigener muttering</i> <i>trolled</i> up to <i>her</i> <i>fabulosa</i> <i>lattie</i>, even unto heaven.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 31</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present <i>trolled</i> out to the <i>smokes</i> of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly <i>battyfanged</i> them all. Then all the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>trolled back</i>, every <i>homie</i> to <i>her</i> <i>fakement</i>, into their own <i>smokes</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the <i>godly homies</i> and the Levites after their courses, every <i>homie</i> according to <i>her</i> service, the <i>godly homies</i> and Levites for burnt <i>parkerings</i> and for peace <i>parkerings</i>, to minister, and to <i>parker</i> thanks, and to praise in the gates of the <i>trolling letties</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> appointed also the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s portion of <i>her</i> substance for the burnt <i>parkerings</i>, to wit, for the morning and <i>bijou nochy</i> burnt <i>parkerings</i>, and the burnt <i>parkerings</i> for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set <i>dowry munjarlees</i>, as it is <i>screeved</i> in the law of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover <i>she</i> commanded the <i>homies and palones</i> that <i>letted</i> in Jerusalem to <i>parker</i> the portion of the <i>godly homies</i> and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And as soon as the <i>butch lav</i> <i>trolled</i> abroad, the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, <i>sherry</i>, and <i>lube</i>, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all <i>fakements</i> brought they in <i>dowrily</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And concerning the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel and Judah, that <i>letted</i> in the <i>smokes</i> of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of <i>fabulosa</i> <i>fakements</i> which were consecrated unto the <i>Duchess</i> their <i>Gloria</i>, and <i>laued</i> them by heaps.
    </li>
    <li>In the third month they began to <i>lett</i> the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the <i>setterth</i> month.
    </li>
    <li>And when Hezekiah and the <i>princesses</i> <i>trolled</i> and <i>vardad</i> the heaps, they <i>fabed</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i> Israel.
    </li>
    <li>Then Hezekiah questioned with the <i>godly homies</i> and the Levites concerning the heaps.
    </li>
    <li>And Azariah the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homie</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of Zadok answered <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Since the <i>homies and palones</i> began to <i>parker</i> the <i>parkerings</i> into the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, we have had enough to <i>jarry</i>, and have <i>dry</i> plenty: for the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>fabed</i> <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>; and that which is <i>dry</i> is this <i>dowry</i> store.
    </li>
    <li>Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>; and they prepared them,
    </li>
    <li>And brought in the <i>parkerings</i> and the tithes and the dedicated <i>fakements</i> <i>fabulously</i>: over which Cononiah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei <i>her</i> <i>sister</i> was the next.
    </li>
    <li>And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the <i>famble</i> of Cononiah and Shimei <i>her</i> <i>sister</i>, at the <i>butch lav</i> of Hezekiah the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and Azariah the ruler of the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Kore the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the east, was over the freewill <i>parkerings</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, to distribute the oblations of the <i>Duchess</i>, and the most <i>fabulosa</i> <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And next <i>her</i> were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the <i>smokes</i> of the <i>godly homies</i>, in their set office, to <i>parker</i> to their <i>sisters</i> by courses, as well to the <i>dowry</i> as to the <i>pogey</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Beside their genealogy of males, from <i>trey</i> years <i>badge</i> and upward, even unto every <i>una</i> that entereth into the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>her</i> daily portion for their service in their charges according to their courses;
    </li>
    <li>Both to the genealogy of the <i>godly homies</i> by the <i>lattie</i> of their <i>aunties</i>, and the Levites from <i>dewey dacha</i> years <i>badge</i> and upward, in their charges by their courses;
    </li>
    <li>And to the genealogy of all their <i>bijou</i> ones, their <i>palone affairs</i>, and their <i>homie chavvies</i>, and their <i>palone chavvies</i>, through all the <i>punters</i>: for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness:
    </li>
    <li>Also of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Aaron the <i>godly homies</i>, which were in the fields of the suburbs of their <i>smokes</i>, in every several <i>smoke</i>, the <i>homies</i> that were expressed by name, to <i>parker</i> portions to all the males among the <i>godly homies</i>, and to all that were reckoned by genealogies among the Levites.
    </li>
    <li>And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought that which was <i>bona</i> and <i>sweet</i> and truth before the <i>Duchess</i> <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And in every <i>acting dickey</i> that <i>she</i> began in the service of the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and in the law, and in the <i>butch lavs</i>, to <i>charper</i> <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i>, <i>she</i> did it with all <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>, and prospered.

    <h2>Chapter 32</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>After these <i>fakements</i>, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria <i>trolled</i>, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fenced <i>smokes</i>, and thought to win them for himself.
    </li>
    <li>And when Hezekiah <i>vardad</i> that Sennacherib was <i>troll</i>, and that <i>she</i> was purposed to <i>palaver</i> against Jerusalem,
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> <i>lelled</i> counsel with <i>her</i> <i>princesses</i> and <i>her</i> <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i> to stop the <i>aquas</i> of the fountains which were <i>nanti</i> the <i>smoke</i>: and they did help <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So there was gathered <i>dowry</i> <i>homies and palones</i> together, who stopped all the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, <i>cackling</i>, Why should the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Assyria <i>troll</i>, and find <i>dowry</i> <i>aqua</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Also <i>she</i> strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall <i>nanti</i>, and repaired Millo in the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i>, and made darts and shields in abundance.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> set captains of <i>barney</i> over the <i>homies and palones</i>, and gathered them together to <i>her</i> in the street of the gate of the <i>smoke</i>, and <i>cackled</i> comfortably to them, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Be <i>butch</i> and courageous, be not afraid <i>nishta</i> dismayed for the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria, <i>nishta</i> for all the multitude that is with <i>her</i>: for there be more with us than with <i>her</i>:
    </li>
    <li>With <i>her</i> is an arm of flesh; but with us is the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i> to help us, and to <i>palaver</i> our battles. And the <i>homies and palones</i> rested themselves upon the <i>lavs</i> of Hezekiah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah.
    </li>
    <li>After this did Sennacherib <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria <i>lau</i> <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i> to Jerusalem, (but <i>she</i> himself <i>laued</i> siege against Lachish, and all <i>her</i> power with <i>her</i>,) unto Hezekiah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> Sennacherib <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye <i>lett</i> in the siege in Jerusalem?
    </li>
    <li>Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to <i>parker</i> over yourselves to <i>cark it</i> by <i>nix munjarlee</i> and by thirst, <i>cackling</i>, The <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i> shall deliver us out of the <i>famble</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria?
    </li>
    <li>Hath not the same Hezekiah <i>lelled</i> away <i>her</i> high places and <i>her</i> altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, <i>cackling</i>, Ye shall worship before <i>una</i> <i>grovelling fakement</i>, and burn <i>smelly</i> upon it?
    </li>
    <li>Know ye not what I and my <i>aunties</i> have done unto all the <i>homies and palones</i> of other lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine <i>famble</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my <i>aunties</i> utterly <i>battyfanged</i>, that could deliver <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i> out of mine <i>famble</i>, that your <i>Gloria</i> should be able to deliver you out of mine <i>famble</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Now therefore let not Hezekiah <i>mogue</i> you, <i>nishta</i> persuade you on this manner, <i>nishta</i> yet believe <i>her</i>: for no <i>Gloria</i> of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i> out of mine <i>famble</i>, and out of the <i>famble</i> of my <i>aunties</i>: how <i>dowry</i> <i>nanti dowry</i> shall your <i>Gloria</i> deliver you out of mine <i>famble</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i> <i>cackled</i> yet more against the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>, and against <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i> Hezekiah.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> <i>screeved</i> also letters to rail on the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, and to <i>cackle</i> against <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, As the gods of the nations of other lands have not <i>laued</i> their <i>homies and palones</i> out of mine <i>famble</i>, so shall not the <i>Gloria</i> of Hezekiah deliver <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i> out of mine <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then they <i>screeched</i> with a loud <i>cackling fakement</i> in the <i>kosher homies</i>&#8216; <i>cackle</i> unto the <i>homies and palones</i> of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might <i>lell</i> the <i>smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>cackled</i> against the <i>Gloria</i> of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the <i>homies and palones</i> of the earth, which were the <i>acting dickey</i> of the <i>fambles</i> of <i>homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And for this cause Hezekiah the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and the prophet Isaiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Amoz, prayed and <i>screeched</i> to heaven.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>laued</i> an <i>fairy</i>, which cut off all the <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i> of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria. So <i>she</i> <i>trolled back</i> with <i>scharda</i> of <i>eke</i> to <i>her</i> own land. And when <i>she</i> was <i>troll</i> into the <i>lattie</i> of <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i>, they that <i>trolled</i> forth of <i>her</i> own <i>chutney locker</i> <i>ferricadoozaed</i> <i>her</i> there with the <i>dowry efink</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thus the <i>Duchess</i> saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the <i>famble</i> of Sennacherib the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria, and from the <i>famble</i> of all other, and guided them on every side.
    </li>
    <li>And many brought gifts unto the <i>Duchess</i> to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah: so that <i>she</i> was magnified in the <i>vardaing</i> of all nations from thenceforth.
    </li>
    <li>In those days Hezekiah was sick to the <i>carking it</i>, and prayed unto the <i>Duchess</i>: and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, and <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> a sign.
    </li>
    <li>But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto <i>her</i>; for <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon <i>her</i>, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>, both <i>she</i> and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.
    </li>
    <li>And Hezekiah had exceeding <i>dowry</i> riches and honour: and <i>she</i> made himself treasuries for silver, and for <i>gelt</i>, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of <i>dolly</i> <i>groinage</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and <i>sherry</i>, and <i>lube</i>; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover <i>she</i> provided <i>her</i> <i>smokes</i>, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for <i>Gloria</i> had <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> substance <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it <i>hettie</i> down to the west side of the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i>. And Hezekiah prospered in all <i>her</i> works.
    </li>
    <li>Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the <i>princesses</i> of Babylon, who <i>laued</i> unto <i>her</i> to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land, <i>Gloria</i> <i>dry</i> <i>her</i>, to try <i>her</i>, that <i>she</i> might know all that was in <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now the <i>lettie</i> of the acts of Hezekiah, and <i>her</i> goodness, <i>varda</i>, they are <i>screeved</i> in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Amoz, and in the <i>glossy</i> of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Judah and Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And Hezekiah <i>lettied</i> with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>, and they buried <i>her</i> in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of <i>Davina</i>: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did <i>her</i> honour at <i>her</i> <i>carking it</i>. And Manasseh <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> reigned in <i>her</i> stead.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 33</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Manasseh was <i>kenza</i> years <i>badge</i> when <i>she</i> began to reign, and <i>she</i> reigned <i>chinker dacha</i> and <i>chinker</i> years in Jerusalem:
    </li>
    <li>But did that which was <i>nana</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, like unto the <i>dowry cods</i> of the heathen, whom the <i>Duchess</i> had cast out before the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> built again the high places which Hezekiah <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> had broken down, and <i>she</i> reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.
    </li>
    <li>Also <i>she</i> built altars in the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, whereof the <i>Duchess</i> had <i>cackled</i>, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> built altars for all the host of heaven in the <i>dewey</i> courts of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> caused <i>her</i> <i>chavvies</i> to pass through the <i>binco fakement</i> in the valley of the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Hinnom: also <i>she</i> observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar <i>Fairy</i>, and with wizards: <i>she</i> wrought <i>dowry</i> <i>nana</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, to provoke <i>her</i> to <i>wild</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> set a carved image, the idol which <i>she</i> had made, in the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, of which <i>Gloria</i> had <i>cackled</i> to <i>Davina</i> and to Solomon <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>, In this <i>lattie</i>, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:
    </li>
    <li><i>Nishta</i> will I any more remove the <i>plate</i> of Israel from out of the land which I have appointed for your <i>aunties</i>; so that they will <i>lell</i> heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the <i>dowry lavs</i> and the ordinances by the <i>famble</i> of <i>Maureen</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, and to do worse than the heathen, whom the <i>Duchess</i> had <i>battyfanged</i> before the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> to Manasseh, and to <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>: but they would not <i>aunt nell</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore the <i>Duchess</i> brought upon them the captains of the host of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria, which <i>lelled</i> Manasseh among the thorns, and bound <i>her</i> with fetters, and <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> to Babylon.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> was in affliction, <i>she</i> besought the <i>Duchess</i> <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i>, and humbled himself greatly before the <i>Gloria</i> of <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And prayed unto <i>her</i>: and <i>she</i> was intreated of <i>her</i>, and <i>aunt nelled</i> <i>her</i> supplication, and brought <i>her</i> again to Jerusalem into <i>her</i> kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the <i>Duchess</i> <i>she</i> was <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now after this <i>she</i> built a wall <i>nanti</i> the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i>, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry</i> height, and put captains of <i>barney</i> in all the fenced <i>smokes</i> of Judah.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> away the strange gods, and the idol out of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and all the altars that <i>she</i> had built in the mount of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the <i>smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> repaired the <i>grovelling fakement</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and sacrificed thereon peace <i>parkerings</i> and thank <i>parkerings</i>, and commanded Judah to serve the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> the <i>homies and palones</i> did <i>parker</i> still in the high places, yet unto the <i>Duchess</i> their <i>Gloria</i> only.
    </li>
    <li>Now the <i>lettie</i> of the acts of Manasseh, and <i>her</i> <i>meshigener muttering</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i>, and the <i>lavs</i> of the seers that <i>cackled</i> to <i>her</i> in the name of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, <i>varda</i>, they are <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li><i>Her</i> <i>meshigener muttering</i> also, and how <i>Gloria</i> was intreated of <i>her</i>, and all <i>her</i> <i>kertervers</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>caterver</i>, and the places wherein <i>she</i> built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before <i>she</i> was humbled: <i>varda</i>, they are <i>screeved</i> among the sayings of the seers.
    </li>
    <li>So Manasseh <i>lettied</i> with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>, and they buried <i>her</i> in <i>her</i> own <i>lattie</i>: and Amon <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> reigned in <i>her</i> stead.
    </li>
    <li>Amon was <i>dewey</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i> years <i>badge</i> when <i>she</i> began to reign, and reigned <i>dewey</i> years in Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> did that which was <i>nana</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, as did Manasseh <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>: for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which Manasseh <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> had made, and served them;
    </li>
    <li>And humbled not himself before the <i>Duchess</i>, as Manasseh <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i> conspired against <i>her</i>, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> <i>her</i> in <i>her</i> own <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>homies and palones</i> of the land <i>ferricadoozaed</i> all them that had conspired against <i>dowriest homie</i> Amon; and the <i>homies and palones</i> of the land made Josiah <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> in <i>her</i> stead.

    <h2>Chapter 34</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Josiah was <i>say dooe</i> years <i>badge</i> when <i>she</i> began to reign, and <i>she</i> reigned in Jerusalem <i>una</i> and <i>trey dacha</i> years.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> did that which was <i>sweet</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>minced</i> in the ways of <i>Davina</i> <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, and declined <i>nishta</i> to the <i>sweet martini</i>, <i>nishta</i> to the <i>dry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For in the <i>otterth</i> year of <i>her</i> reign, while <i>she</i> was yet <i>bean</i>, <i>she</i> began to <i>charper</i> after the <i>Gloria</i> of <i>Davina</i> <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>: and in the twelfth year <i>she</i> began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images.
    </li>
    <li>And they brake down the altars of Baalim in <i>her</i> presence; and the images, that were on high above them, <i>she</i> cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, <i>she</i> brake in pieces, and made dust of them, and strowed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> burnt the bones of the <i>godly homies</i> upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And so did <i>she</i> in the <i>smokes</i> of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, <i>she</i> <i>trolled back to</i> Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>Now in the eighteenth year of <i>her</i> reign, when <i>she</i> had purged the land, and the <i>lattie</i>, <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> Shaphan the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the <i>smoke</i>, and Joah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when they <i>trolled</i> to Hilkiah the high <i>godly homie</i>, they <i>laued</i> the <i>dinarly</i> that was brought into the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the <i>famble</i> of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they <i>trolled back to</i> Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And they put it in the <i>famble</i> of the workmen that had the oversight of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and they <i>parkered</i> it to the workmen that wrought in the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, to repair and amend the <i>lattie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Even to the artificers and builders <i>parkered</i> they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the <i>latties</i> which the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Judah had <i>battyfanged</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>homies</i> did the <i>acting dickey</i> <i>fabulously</i>: and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and other of the Levites, all that could skill of instruments of musick.
    </li>
    <li>Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers of all that wrought the <i>acting dickey</i> in any manner of service: and of the Levites there were <i>betty bracelets</i>, and <i>hilda handcuffs</i>, and porters.
    </li>
    <li>And when they brought out the <i>dinarly</i> that was brought into the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, Hilkiah the <i>godly homie</i> found a <i>glossy</i> of the law of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>parkered</i> by <i>Maureen</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Hilkiah answered and <i>cackled</i> to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the <i>glossy</i> of the law in the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>. And Hilkiah <i>laued</i> the <i>glossy</i> to Shaphan.
    </li>
    <li>And Shaphan <i>lelled</i> the <i>glossy</i> to the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and brought the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>lav</i> back again, <i>cackling</i>, All that was committed to thy <i>serving homies</i>, they do it.
    </li>
    <li>And they have gathered together the <i>dinarly</i> that was found in the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and have <i>laued</i> it into the <i>famble</i> of the overseers, and to the <i>famble</i> of the workmen.
    </li>
    <li>Then Shaphan the scribe <i>cackled</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Hilkiah the <i>godly homie</i> hath <i>parkered</i> me a <i>glossy</i>. And Shaphan <i>varda the lavs</i> it before the <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when the <i>dowriest homie</i> had <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>lavs</i> of the law, that <i>she</i> rent <i>her</i> <i>zhoosh</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Shaphan, and Abdon the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a <i>serving homie</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Troll</i>, enquire of the <i>Duchess</i> for me, and for them that are <i>dry</i> in Israel and in Judah, concerning the <i>lavs</i> of the <i>glossy</i> that is found: for <i>dowry</i> is the wrath of the <i>Duchess</i> that is poured out upon us, because our <i>aunties</i> have not kept the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, to do after all that is <i>screeved</i> in this <i>glossy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Hilkiah, and they that the <i>dowriest homie</i> had appointed, <i>trolled</i> to Huldah the prophetess, the <i>palone affair</i> of Shallum the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Tikvath, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she <i>letted</i> in Jerusalem in the college:) and they <i>cackled</i> to her to that effect.
    </li>
    <li>And she answered them, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, <i>cackle</i> ye the <i>homie</i> that <i>laued</i> you to me,
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>varda</i>, I will <i>parker</i> <i>nana</i> upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> which they have <i>varda the lavs</i> before the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah:
    </li>
    <li>Because they have forsaken me, and have burned <i>smelly</i> unto other gods, that they might provoke me to <i>wild</i> with all the works of their <i>fambles</i>; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.
    </li>
    <li>And as for the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, who <i>laued</i> you to enquire of the <i>Duchess</i>, so shall ye <i>cackle</i> unto <i>her</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel concerning the <i>lavs</i> which thou hast <i>aunt nelled</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Because thine <i>thumping cheat</i> was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before <i>Gloria</i>, when thou heardest <i>her</i> <i>lavs</i> against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy <i>zhoosh</i>, and <i>parnie</i> before me; I have even <i>aunt nelled</i> thee also, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, I will gather thee to thy <i>aunties</i>, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, <i>nishta</i> shall thine <i>ogles</i> <i>varda</i> all the <i>nana</i> that I will <i>parker</i> upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>lav</i> again.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>laued</i> and gathered together all the <i>fungi</i> of Judah and Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>trolled</i> up into the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and all the <i>homies</i> of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the <i>godly homies</i>, and the Levites, and all the <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>dowry</i> and <i>pogey</i>: and <i>she</i> <i>varda the lavs</i> in their <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> all the <i>lavs</i> of the <i>glossy</i> of the covenant that was found in the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> stood in <i>her</i> place, and made a covenant before the <i>Duchess</i>, to <i>mince</i> after the <i>Duchess</i>, and to keep <i>her</i> <i>butch lavs</i>, and <i>her</i> testimonies, and <i>her</i> <i>dowry lavs</i>, with all <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>, and with all <i>her</i> <i>nishta lucoddy</i>, to perform the <i>lavs</i> of the covenant which are <i>screeved</i> in this <i>glossy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of <i>Gloria</i>, the <i>Gloria</i> of their <i>aunties</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Josiah <i>lelled</i> away all the <i>dowry cods</i> out of all the countries that pertained to the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the <i>Duchess</i> their <i>Gloria</i>.

    <li>And <i>she</i> set the <i>godly homies</i> in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>,

    <li>And <i>cackled</i> unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were <i>fabulosa</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>, Put the <i>fabulosa</i> <i>bijou arkette</i> in the <i>lattie</i> which Solomon the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>Davina</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel did build; it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders: serve now the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i> Israel,
    </li>
    <li>And prepare yourselves by the <i>latties</i> of your <i>aunties</i>, after your courses, according to the <i>screeving</i> of <i>Davina</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel, and according to the <i>screeving</i> of Solomon <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And stand in the <i>fabulosa</i> place according to the divisions of the families of the <i>aunties</i> of your <i>sisters</i> the <i>homies and palones</i>, and after the division of the families of the Levites.
    </li>
    <li>So <i>ferricadoza</i> the <i>trollover</i>, and <i>bonafy</i> yourselves, and prepare your <i>sisters</i>, that they may do according to the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> by the <i>famble</i> of <i>Maureen</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Josiah <i>parkered</i> to the <i>homies and palones</i>, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the <i>trollover</i> <i>parkerings</i>, for all that were present, to the number of <i>trey dacha</i> <i>mille</i>, and <i>trey</i> <i>mille</i> bullocks: these were of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s substance.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>her</i> <i>princesses</i> <i>parkered</i> willingly unto the <i>homies and palones</i>, to the <i>godly homies</i>, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, <i>parkered</i> unto the <i>godly homies</i> for the <i>trollover</i> <i>parkerings</i> <i>dewey</i> <i>mille</i> and <i>sey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>pogey</i> cattle and <i>trey</i> <i>chenter</i> oxen.
    </li>
    <li>Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, <i>dowriest</i> of the Levites, <i>parkered</i> unto the Levites for <i>trollover</i> <i>parkerings</i> <i>chinker</i> <i>mille</i> <i>pogey</i> cattle, and <i>chinker</i> <i>chenter</i> oxen.
    </li>
    <li>So the service was prepared, and the <i>godly homies</i> stood in their place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>butch lav</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>ferricadozad</i> the <i>trollover</i>, and the <i>godly homies</i> sprinkled the blood from their <i>fambles</i>, and the Levites flayed them.
    </li>
    <li>And they removed the burnt <i>parkerings</i>, that they might <i>parker</i> according to the divisions of the families of the <i>homies and palones</i>, to offer unto the <i>Duchess</i>, as it is <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of <i>Maureen</i>. And so did they with the oxen.
    </li>
    <li>And they roasted the <i>trollover</i> with <i>binco fakement</i> according to the ordinance: but the other <i>fabulosa</i> <i>parkerings</i> sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and <i>medzered</i> them speedily among all the <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the <i>godly homies</i>: because the <i>godly homies</i> the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Aaron were busied in <i>parkering</i> of burnt <i>parkerings</i> and the fat until <i>nochy</i>; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the <i>godly homies</i> the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Aaron.
    </li>
    <li>And the singers the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Asaph were in their place, according to the <i>butch lav</i> of <i>Davina</i>, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s seer; and the porters waited at every gate; they might not <i>troll off</i> from their service; for their <i>sisters</i> the Levites prepared for them.
    </li>
    <li>So all the service of the <i>Duchess</i> was prepared the same <i>journo</i>, to keep the <i>trollover</i>, and to offer burnt <i>parkerings</i> upon the <i>grovelling fakement</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, according to the <i>butch lav</i> of <i>dowriest homie</i> Josiah.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel that were present kept the <i>trollover</i> at that time, and the <i>dowry munjarlee</i> of unleavened <i>pannan</i> <i>setter</i> days.
    </li>
    <li>And there was no <i>trollover</i> like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; <i>nishta</i> did all the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Israel keep such a <i>trollover</i> as Josiah kept, and the <i>godly homies</i>, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this <i>trollover</i> kept.
    </li>
    <li>After all this, when Josiah had prepared the <i>holy carsey</i>, Necho <i>dowriest homie</i> of Egypt <i>trolled</i> up to <i>palaver</i> against Charchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah <i>trolled</i> out against <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> ambassadors to <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, What have I to do with thee, thou <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah? I <i>troll</i> not against thee this <i>journo</i>, but against the <i>lattie</i> wherewith I have <i>barney</i>: for <i>Gloria</i> commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from meddling with <i>Gloria</i>, who is with me, that <i>she</i> <i>battyfang</i> thee not.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> Josiah would not turn <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> from <i>her</i>, but disguised himself, that <i>she</i> might <i>palaver</i> with <i>her</i>, and <i>aunt nelled</i> not unto the <i>lavs</i> of Necho from the <i>screech</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and <i>trolled</i> to <i>palaver</i> in the valley of Megiddo.
    </li>
    <li>And the archers shot at <i>dowriest homie</i> Josiah; and the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i> to <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.
    </li>
    <li><i>Her</i> <i>serving homies</i> therefore <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> out of that <i>trundling cheat</i>, and put <i>her</i> in the second <i>trundling cheat</i> that <i>she</i> had; and they brought <i>her</i> to Jerusalem, and <i>she</i> <i>carked it</i>, and was buried in <i>una</i> of the sepulchres of <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.
    </li>
    <li>And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing <i>homies</i> and the singing <i>palones</i> <i>cackled</i> of Josiah in their lamentations to this <i>journo</i>, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, <i>varda</i>, they are <i>screeved</i> in the lamentations.
    </li>
    <li>Now the <i>lettie</i> of the acts of Josiah, and <i>her</i> goodness, according to that which was <i>screeved</i> in the law of the <i>Duchess</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>her</i> deeds, first and last, <i>varda</i>, they are <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Israel and Judah.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 36</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Then the <i>homies and palones</i> of the land <i>lelled</i> Jehoahaz the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Josiah, and made <i>her</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> in <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s stead in Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>Jehoahaz was <i>dewey dacha</i> and <i>trey</i> years <i>badge</i> when <i>she</i> began to reign, and <i>she</i> reigned <i>trey</i> months in Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Egypt put <i>her</i> down at Jerusalem, and condemned the land in an <i>chenter</i> talents of silver and a talent of <i>gelt</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Egypt made Eliakim <i>her</i> <i>sister</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> over Judah and Jerusalem, and turned <i>her</i> name to Jehoiakim. And Necho <i>lelled</i> Jehoahaz <i>her</i> <i>sister</i>, and <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> to Egypt.
    </li>
    <li>Jehoiakim was <i>dewey dacha</i> and <i>chinker</i> years <i>badge</i> when <i>she</i> began to reign, and <i>she</i> reigned <i>long dedger</i> years in Jerusalem: and <i>she</i> did that which was <i>nana</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Against <i>her</i> <i>trolled</i> up Nebuchadnezzar <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon, and bound <i>her</i> in fetters, to carry <i>her</i> to Babylon.
    </li>
    <li>Nebuchadnezzar also <i>lelled</i> of the <i>fakements</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> to Babylon, and put them in <i>her</i> <i>holy carsey</i> at Babylon.
    </li>
    <li>Now the <i>lettie</i> of the acts of Jehoiakim, and <i>her</i> <i>dowry cods</i> which <i>she</i> did, and that which was found in <i>her</i>, <i>varda</i>, they are <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> reigned in <i>her</i> stead.
    </li>
    <li>Jehoiachin was <i>say dooe</i> years <i>badge</i> when <i>she</i> began to reign, and <i>she</i> reigned <i>trey</i> months and <i>dacha</i> days in Jerusalem: and <i>she</i> did that which was <i>nana</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when the year was expired, <i>dowriest homie</i> Nebuchadnezzar <i>laued</i>, and brought <i>her</i> to Babylon, with the goodly <i>fakements</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and made Zedekiah <i>her</i> <i>sister</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> over Judah and Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>Zedekiah was <i>una</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i> years <i>badge</i> when <i>she</i> began to reign, and reigned <i>long dedger</i> years in Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> did that which was <i>nana</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i>, and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the <i>screech</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> also rebelled against <i>dowriest homie</i> Nebuchadnezzar, who had made <i>her</i> swear by <i>Gloria</i>: but <i>she</i> stiffened <i>her</i> neck, and hardened <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> from turning unto the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover all the <i>dowriest</i> of the <i>godly homies</i>, and the <i>homies and palones</i>, transgressed <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry</i> after all the <i>dowry cods</i> of the heathen; and <i>dingy</i> the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> which <i>she</i> had hallowed in Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of their <i>aunties</i> <i>laued</i> to them by <i>her</i> messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because <i>she</i> had compassion on <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, and on <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>But they mocked the messengers of <i>Gloria</i>, and despised <i>her</i> <i>lavs</i>, and misused <i>her</i> prophets, until the wrath of the <i>Duchess</i> arose against <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, till there was no remedy.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore <i>she</i> brought upon them the <i>dowriest homie</i> of the Chaldees, who <i>ferricadoozaed</i> their <i>bean coves</i> with the <i>dowry efink</i> in the <i>lattie</i> of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon <i>bean cove</i> or maiden, <i>badge cove</i>, or <i>her</i> that stooped for age: <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> them all into <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And all the <i>fakements</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, <i>dowry</i> and <i>pogey</i>, and the <i>gelt</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and the <i>gelt</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and of <i>her</i> <i>princesses</i>; all these <i>she</i> brought to Babylon.
    </li>
    <li>And they burnt the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the <i>dowry latties</i> thereof with <i>binco fakement</i>, and <i>battyfanged</i> all the goodly <i>fakements</i> thereof.
    </li>
    <li>And them that had <i>scarpered</i> from the <i>dowry efink</i> <i>lelled</i> <i>she</i> away to Babylon; where they were <i>serving homies</i> to <i>her</i> and <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> until the reign of the kingdom of Persia:
    </li>
    <li>To fulfil the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> by the <i>screech</i> of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as long as she <i>lett</i> desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfil <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> and <i>dacha</i> years.
    </li>
    <li>Now in the first year of Cyrus <i>dowriest homie</i> of Persia, that the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> by the <i>screech</i> of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the <i>Duchess</i> stirred up the <i>Fairy</i> of Cyrus <i>dowriest homie</i> of Persia, that <i>she</i> made a proclamation throughout all <i>her</i> kingdom, and put it also in <i>screeving</i>, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> Cyrus <i>dowriest homie</i> of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of heaven <i>parkered</i> me; and <i>she</i> hath charged me to build <i>her</i> an <i>lattie</i> in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is there among you of all <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>? The <i>Duchess</i> <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i> be with <i>her</i>, and let <i>her</i> <i>troll</i> up.
