    <h1>Ezekiel</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now it <i>trolled</i> to pass in the thirtieth year, in the <i>quarter</i> month, in the fifth <i>journo</i> of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I <i>vardad</i> visions of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>In the fifth <i>journo</i> of the month, which was the fifth year of <i>dowriest homie</i> Jehoiachin&#8217;s captivity,
    </li>
    <li>The <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> expressly unto Ezekiel the <i>godly homie</i>, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the <i>famble</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> was there upon <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And I looked, and, <i>varda</i>, a whirlwind <i>trolled</i> out of the north, a <i>dowry</i> cloud, and a <i>binco fakement</i> infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the <i>binco fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Also out of the midst thereof <i>trolled</i> the likeness of <i>quarter</i> living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a <i>homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And every <i>una</i> had <i>quarter</i> <i>ekes</i>, and every <i>una</i> had <i>quarter</i> wings.
    </li>
    <li>And their <i>plates</i> were <i>hettie</i> <i>plates</i>; and the sole of their <i>plates</i> was like the sole of a calf&#8217;s <i>plate</i>: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.
    </li>
    <li>And they had the <i>fambles</i> of a <i>homie</i> under their wings on their <i>quarter</i> sides; and they <i>quarter</i> had their <i>ekes</i> and their wings.
    </li>
    <li>Their wings were joined <i>una</i> to another; they turned not when they <i>trolled</i>; they <i>trolled</i> every <i>una</i> <i>hettie</i> forward.
    </li>
    <li>As for the likeness of their <i>ekes</i>, they <i>quarter</i> had the <i>eke</i> of a <i>homie</i>, and the <i>eke</i> of a lion, on the <i>sweet</i> side: and they <i>quarter</i> had the <i>eke</i> of an ox on the <i>dry</i> side; they <i>quarter</i> also had the <i>eke</i> of an eagle.
    </li>
    <li>Thus were their <i>ekes</i>: and their wings were stretched upward; <i>dewey</i> wings of every <i>una</i> were joined <i>una</i> to another, and <i>dewey</i> covered their bodies.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>trolled</i> every <i>una</i> <i>hettie</i> forward: whither the <i>Fairy</i> was to <i>troll</i>, they <i>trolled</i>; and they turned not when they <i>trolled</i>.
    </li>
    <li>As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of <i>binco fakement</i>, and like the appearance of <i>bincos</i>: it <i>trolled</i> up and down among the living creatures; and the <i>binco fakement</i> was bright, and out of the <i>binco fakement</i> <i>trolled</i> forth lightning.
    </li>
    <li>And the living creatures ran and <i>trolled back</i> as the appearance of a flash of lightning.
    </li>
    <li>Now as I beheld the living creatures, <i>varda</i> <i>una</i> wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with <i>her</i> <i>quarter</i> <i>ekes</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The appearance of the wheels and their <i>acting dickey</i> was like unto the colour of a beryl: and they <i>quarter</i> had <i>una</i> likeness: and their appearance and their <i>acting dickey</i> was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.
    </li>
    <li>When they <i>trolled</i>, they <i>trolled</i> upon their <i>quarter</i> sides: and they turned not when they <i>trolled</i>.
    </li>
    <li>As for their <i>famble cheats</i>, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their <i>famble cheats</i> were full of <i>ogles</i> round about them <i>quarter</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when the living creatures <i>trolled</i>, the wheels <i>trolled</i> by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.
    </li>
    <li>Whithersoever the <i>Fairy</i> was to <i>troll</i>, they <i>trolled</i>, thither was their <i>Fairy</i> to <i>troll</i>; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the <i>Fairy</i> of the living creature was in the wheels.
    </li>
    <li>When those <i>trolled</i>, these <i>trolled</i>; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the <i>Fairy</i> of the living creature was in the wheels.
    </li>
    <li>And the likeness of the firmament upon the <i>ekes</i> of the living creature was as the colour of the <i>nanna</i> crystal, stretched forth over their <i>ekes</i> above.
    </li>
    <li>And under the firmament were their wings <i>hettie</i>, the <i>una</i> toward the other: every <i>una</i> had <i>dewey</i>, which covered on this side, and every <i>una</i> had <i>dewey</i>, which covered on that side, their bodies.
    </li>
    <li>And when they <i>trolled</i>, I <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>screech</i> of their wings, like the <i>screech</i> of <i>dowry</i> <i>aquas</i>, as the <i>cackling fakement</i> of the <i>Dowry butch</i>, the <i>cackling fakement</i> of <i>cackle</i>, as the <i>screech</i> of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.
    </li>
    <li>And there was a <i>cackling fakement</i> from the firmament that was over their <i>ekes</i>, when they stood, and had let down their wings.
    </li>
    <li>And above the firmament that was over their <i>ekes</i> was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a <i>homie</i> above upon it.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>vardad</i> as the colour of amber, as the appearance of <i>binco fakement</i> round about within it, from the appearance of <i>her</i> loins even upward, and from the appearance of <i>her</i> loins even downward, I <i>vardad</i> as it were the appearance of <i>binco fakement</i>, and it had brightness round about.
    </li>
    <li>As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the <i>journo</i> of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the <i>fabeness</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>. And when I <i>vardad</i> it, I fell upon my <i>eke</i>, and I <i>aunt nelled</i> a <i>cackling fakement</i> of <i>una</i> that <i>cackled</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, stand upon thy <i>plates</i>, and I will <i>cackle</i> unto thee.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Fairy</i> entered into me when <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, and set me upon my <i>plates</i>, that I <i>aunt nelled</i> <i>her</i> that <i>cackled</i> unto me.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, I <i>lau</i> thee to the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their <i>aunties</i> have transgressed against me, even unto this <i>dowry</i> <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For they are impudent <i>chavvies</i> and stiffhearted. I do <i>lau</i> thee unto them; and thou shalt <i>cackle</i> unto them, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they, whether they will <i>aunt nell</i>, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious <i>lattie</i>,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.
    </li>
    <li>And thou, <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, be not afraid of them, <i>nishta</i> be afraid of their <i>lavs</i>, though briers and thorns be with thee, and thou dost <i>lett</i> among scorpions: be not afraid of their <i>lavs</i>, <i>nishta</i> be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And thou shalt <i>cackle</i> my <i>lavs</i> unto them, whether they will <i>aunt nell</i>, or whether they will forbear: for they are most rebellious.
    </li>
    <li>But thou, <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, <i>aunt nell</i> what I <i>cackle</i> unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious <i>lattie</i>: open thy <i>screech</i>, and <i>jarry</i> that I <i>parker</i> thee.
    </li>
    <li>And when I looked, <i>varda</i>, an <i>famble</i> was <i>laued</i> unto me; and, lo, a roll of a <i>glossy</i> was therein;
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> spread it before me; and it was <i>screeved</i> within and <i>nanti</i>: and there was <i>screeved</i> therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Moreover <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, <i>jarry</i> that thou findest; <i>jarry</i> this roll, and <i>troll</i> <i>cackle</i> unto the <i>lattie</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>So I opened my <i>screech</i>, and <i>she</i> caused me to <i>jarry</i> that roll.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, cause thy belly to <i>jarry</i>, and fill thy <i>chutney locker</i> with this roll that I <i>parker</i> thee. Then did I <i>jarry</i> it; and it was in my <i>screech</i> as honey for sweetness.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, <i>troll</i>, get thee unto the <i>lattie</i> of Israel, and <i>cackle</i> with my <i>lavs</i> unto them.
    </li>
    <li>For thou art not <i>laued</i> to a <i>homies and palones</i> of a strange <i>cackle</i> and of an hard language, but to the <i>lattie</i> of Israel;
    </li>
    <li>Not to many <i>homies and palones</i> of a strange <i>cackle</i> and of an hard language, whose <i>lavs</i> thou canst not understand. Surely, had I <i>laued</i> thee to them, they would have <i>aunt nelled</i> unto thee.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>lattie</i> of Israel will not <i>aunt nell</i> unto thee; for they will not <i>aunt nell</i> unto me: for all the <i>lattie</i> of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, I have made thy <i>eke</i> <i>butch</i> against their <i>ekes</i>, and thy forehead <i>butch</i> against their foreheads.
    </li>
    <li>As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, <i>nishta</i> be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, all my <i>lavs</i> that I shall <i>cackle</i> unto thee <i>lall</i> in thine <i>thumping cheat</i>, and <i>aunt nell</i> with thine <i>aunt nelly cheats</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>troll</i>, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the <i>chavvies</i> of thy <i>homies and palones</i>, and <i>cackle</i> unto them, and <i>cackle</i> them, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>; whether they will <i>aunt nell</i>, or whether they will forbear.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>Fairy</i> <i>lelled</i> me up, and I <i>aunt nelled</i> behind me a <i>cackling fakement</i> of a <i>dowry</i> rushing, <i>cackling</i>, <i>fabed</i> be the <i>fabeness</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> from <i>her</i> place.
    </li>
    <li>I <i>aunt nelled</i> also the <i>screech</i> of the wings of the living creatures that <i>reefed</i> <i>una</i> another, and the <i>screech</i> of the wheels over against them, and a <i>screech</i> of a <i>dowry</i> rushing.
    </li>
    <li>So the <i>Fairy</i> lifted me up, and <i>lelled</i> me away, and I <i>trolled</i> in bitterness, in the heat of my <i>Fairy</i>; but the <i>famble</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> was <i>butch</i> upon me.
    </li>
    <li>Then I <i>trolled</i> to them of the captivity at Telabib, that <i>letted</i> by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there <i>gobsmacked</i> among them <i>setter</i> days.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> at the end of <i>setter</i> days, that the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> unto me, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, I have made thee a watchman unto the <i>lattie</i> of Israel: therefore <i>aunt nell</i> the <i>lav</i> at my <i>screech</i>, and <i>parker</i> them warning from me.
    </li>
    <li>When I <i>cackle</i> unto the <i>naff</i>, Thou shalt surely <i>cark it</i>; and thou givest <i>her</i> not warning, <i>nishta</i> <i>cacklest</i> to warn the <i>naff</i> from <i>her</i> <i>naff</i> way, to save <i>her</i> life; the same <i>naff</i> <i>homie</i> shall <i>cark it</i> in <i>her</i> <i>codness</i>; but <i>her</i> blood will I require at thine <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Yet if thou warn the <i>naff</i>, and <i>she</i> turn not from <i>her</i> <i>naffness</i>, <i>nishta</i> from <i>her</i> <i>naff</i> way, <i>she</i> shall <i>cark it</i> in <i>her</i> <i>codness</i>; but thou hast <i>laued</i> thy <i>nishta lucoddy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Again, When a <i>bona</i> <i>homie</i> doth turn from <i>her</i> <i>bonaness</i>, and commit <i>codness</i>, and I <i>lett</i> a stumbling-block before <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> shall <i>cark it</i>: because thou hast not <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> warning, <i>she</i> shall <i>cark it</i> in <i>her</i> <i>kertever</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>bonaness</i> which <i>she</i> hath done shall not be remembered; but <i>her</i> blood will I require at thine <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> if thou warn the <i>bona</i> <i>homie</i>, that the <i>bona</i> <i>kertever</i> not, and <i>she</i> doth not <i>kertever</i>, <i>she</i> shall surely live, because <i>she</i> is warned; also thou hast <i>laued</i> thy <i>nishta lucoddy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>famble</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> was there upon me; and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, Arise, <i>troll forth</i> into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.
    </li>
    <li>Then I arose, and <i>trolled</i> forth into the plain: and, <i>varda</i>, the <i>fabeness</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> stood there, as the <i>fabeness</i> which I <i>vardad</i> by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my <i>eke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>Fairy</i> entered into me, and set me upon my <i>plates</i>, and <i>cackled</i> with me, and <i>cackled</i> unto me, <i>troll</i>, shut thyself within thine <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But thou, O <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, <i>varda</i>, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and <i>nishta</i> <i>troll out</i> among them:
    </li>
    <li>And I will make thy <i>polari</i> cleave to the roof of thy <i>screech</i>, that thou shalt be <i>nanti polari</i>, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But when I <i>cackle</i> with thee, I will open thy <i>screech</i>, and thou shalt <i>cackle</i> unto them, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>; <i>she</i> that <i>aunt nelleth</i>, let <i>her</i> <i>aunt nell</i>; and <i>she</i> that forbeareth, let <i>her</i> forbear: for they are a rebellious <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Thou also, <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, <i>lell</i> thee a tile, and <i>lett</i> it before thee, and pourtray upon it the <i>smoke</i>, even Jerusalem:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>lett</i> siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set battering rams against it round about.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover <i>lell</i> thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the <i>smoke</i>: and set thy <i>eke</i> against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt <i>lett</i> siege against it. This shall be a sign to the <i>lattie</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>Lie thou also upon thy <i>dry</i> side, and <i>lett</i> the <i>codness</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of Israel upon it: according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their <i>codness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For I have <i>laued</i> upon thee the years of their <i>codness</i>, according to the number of the days, <i>trey</i> <i>chenter</i> and <i>nobber dacha</i> days: so shalt thou bear the <i>codness</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy <i>sweet</i> side, and thou shalt bear the <i>codness</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of Judah <i>quarter dacha</i> days: I have appointed thee each <i>journo</i> for a year.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore thou shalt set thy <i>eke</i> toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thine arm shall be uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it.
    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, I will <i>lett</i> bands upon thee, and <i>nishta</i> turn thee from <i>una</i> side to another, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege.
    </li>
    <li><i>Lell</i> thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and fitches, and put them in <i>una</i> <i>fakement</i>, and make thee <i>pannan</i> thereof, according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, <i>trey</i> <i>chenter</i> and <i>nobber dacha</i> days shalt thou <i>jarry</i> thereof.
    </li>
    <li>And thy <i>carnish</i> which thou shalt <i>jarry</i> shall be by weight, <i>dewey dacha</i> <i>medzers</i> a <i>journo</i>: from time to time shalt thou <i>jarry</i> it.
    </li>
    <li>Thou shalt <i>buvare</i> also <i>aqua</i> by measure, the <i>seyth</i> part of an hin: from time to time shalt thou <i>buvare</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And thou shalt <i>jarry</i> it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it with dung that <i>trolleth</i> out of <i>homie</i>, in their <i>vardaing</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i>, Even thus shall the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>jarry</i> their defiled <i>pannan</i> among the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>, whither I will drive them.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> I, Ah <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>! <i>varda</i>, my <i>nishta lucoddy</i> hath not been <i>dingy</i>: for from my <i>beandom</i> up even till now have I not <i>jarried</i> of that which <i>carketh it</i> of itself, or is torn in pieces; <i>nishta</i> <i>trolled</i> there abominable flesh into my <i>screech</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, Lo, I have <i>parkered</i> thee cow&#8217;s dung for <i>homie</i>&#8216;s dung, and thou shalt prepare thy <i>pannan</i> therewith.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, <i>varda</i>, I will break the <i>trolling fakement</i> of <i>pannan</i> in Jerusalem: and they shall <i>jarry</i> <i>pannan</i> by weight, and with care; and they shall <i>buvare</i> <i>aqua</i> by measure, and with <i>gobsmacked-ness</i>:
    </li>
    <li>That they may want <i>pannan</i> and <i>aqua</i>, and be astonied <i>una</i> with another, and consume away for their <i>codness</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And thou, <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, <i>lell</i> thee a sharp <i>efink</i>, <i>lell</i> thee a <i>crimper</i>&#8216;s <i>fatcha fakement</i>, and cause it to pass upon thine <i>eke</i> and upon thy beard: then <i>lell</i> thee balances to weigh, and divide the <i>riah</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thou shalt burn with <i>binco fakement</i> a third part in the midst of the <i>smoke</i>, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt <i>lell</i> a third part, and <i>slap</i> about it with a <i>efink</i>: and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a <i>dowry efink</i> after them.
    </li>
    <li>Thou shalt also <i>lell</i> thereof a <i>nishta dowry</i> in number, and bind them in thy <i>frocks</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>lell</i> of them again, and cast them into the midst of the <i>binco fakement</i>, and burn them in the <i>binco fakement</i>; for thereof shall a <i>binco fakement</i> <i>troll</i> forth into all the <i>lattie</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>; This is Jerusalem: I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries that are round about her.
    </li>
    <li>And she hath changed my judgments into <i>naffness</i> more than the nations, and my <i>dowry lavs</i> more than the countries that are round about her: for they have refused my judgments and my <i>dowry lavs</i>, they have not <i>minced</i> in them.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>; Because ye multiplied more than the nations that are round about you, and have not <i>minced</i> in my <i>dowry lavs</i>, <i>nishta</i> have kept my judgments, <i>nishta</i> have done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you;
    </li>
    <li>Therefore thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>; <i>varda</i>, I, even I, am against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the <i>vardaing</i> of the nations.
    </li>
    <li>And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine <i>dowry cods</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore the <i>aunties</i> shall <i>jarry</i> the <i>homie chavvies</i> in the midst of thee, and the <i>homie chavvies</i> shall <i>jarry</i> their <i>aunties</i>; and I will execute judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore, as I live, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>; Surely, because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable <i>fakements</i>, and with all thine <i>dowry cods</i>, therefore will I also diminish thee; <i>nishta</i> shall mine <i>ogle</i> spare, <i>nishta</i> will I have any pity.
    </li>
    <li>A third part of thee shall <i>cark it</i> with the <i>bad style</i>, and with <i>nix munjarlee</i> shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part shall fall by the <i>dowry efink</i> round about thee; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a <i>dowry efink</i> after them.
    </li>
    <li>Thus shall mine <i>wild</i> be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to <i>lettie</i> upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the <i>Duchess</i> have <i>cackled</i> it in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in them.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee, in the <i>vardaing</i> of all that <i>troll by</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an <i>gobsmacked-ness</i> unto the nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute judgments in thee in <i>wild</i> and in fury and in furious rebukes. I the <i>Duchess</i> have <i>cackled</i> it.
    </li>
    <li>When I shall <i>lau</i> upon them the <i>nana</i> arrows of <i>nix munjarlee</i>, which shall be for their destruction, and which I will <i>lau</i> to <i>battyfang</i> you: and I will increase the <i>nix munjarlee</i> upon you, and will break your <i>trolling fakement</i> of <i>pannan</i>:
    </li>
    <li>So will I <i>lau</i> upon you <i>nix munjarlee</i> and <i>nana</i> beasts, and they shall bereave thee: and <i>bad style</i> and blood shall pass through thee; and I will <i>parker</i> the <i>dowry efink</i> upon thee. I the <i>Duchess</i> have <i>cackled</i> it.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> unto me, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, set thy <i>eke</i> toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,

    <li>And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken: and I will cast down your <i>ferricadoozed</i> <i>homies</i> before your idols.
    </li>
    <li>And I will <i>lett</i> the <i>stiff</i> carcases of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.
    </li>
    <li>In all your dwellingplaces the <i>smokes</i> shall be <i>laued</i> waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be <i>laued</i> waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your images may be cut down, and your works may be abolished.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>ferricadoozed</i> shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I am the <i>Duchess</i>.

    <li>Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have some that shall escape the <i>dowry efink</i> among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through the countries.
    </li>
    <li>And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be <i>lelled</i> captives, because I am broken with their whorish <i>thumping cheat</i>, which hath <i>trolled off</i> from me, and with their <i>ogles</i>, which <i>troll</i> a <i>bitaining</i> after their idols: and they shall lothe themselves for the <i>nanas</i> which they have committed in all their <i>dowry cods</i>.

    <li>And they shall know that I am the <i>Duchess</i>, and that I have not <i>cackled</i> in vain that I would do this <i>nana</i> unto them.

    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>; <i>slap</i> with thine <i>famble</i>, and stamp with thy <i>plate</i>, and <i>cackle</i>, Alas for all the <i>nana</i> <i>dowry cods</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of Israel! for they shall fall by the <i>dowry efink</i>, by the <i>nix munjarlee</i>, and by the <i>bad style</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> that is far off shall <i>cark it</i> of the <i>bad style</i>; and <i>she</i> that is near shall fall by the <i>dowry efink</i>; and <i>she</i> that remaineth and is besieged shall <i>cark it</i> by the <i>nix munjarlee</i>: thus will I accomplish my fury upon them.
    </li>
    <li>Then shall ye know that I am the <i>Duchess</i>, when their <i>ferricadoozed</i> <i>homies</i> shall be among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hill, in all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the place where they did offer <i>bona</i> savour to all their idols.
    </li>
    <li>So will I stretch out my <i>famble</i> upon them, and make the land desolate, <i>any road up</i>, more desolate than the <i>nishta smoke</i> toward Diblath, in all their habitations: and they shall know that I am the <i>Duchess</i>.

    <li>An end is <i>troll</i>, the end is <i>troll</i>: it watcheth for thee; <i>varda</i>, it is <i>troll</i>.

    <li>The morning is <i>troll</i> unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the time is <i>troll</i>, the <i>journo</i> of trouble is near, and not the sounding again of the mountains.

    <li>Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine <i>wild</i> upon thee: and I will <i>beak</i> thee according to thy ways, and will recompense thee for all thine <i>dowry cods</i>.

    <li>The time is <i>troll</i>, the <i>journo</i> draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, <i>nishta</i> the seller mourn: for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.
    </li>
    <li>For the seller shall not <i>troll back to</i> that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision is <i>reefing</i> the whole multitude thereof, which shall not return; <i>nishta</i> shall any strengthen himself in the <i>codness</i> of <i>her</i> life.
    </li>
    <li>They have blown the <i>tooting fakement</i>, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.

    <li>The <i>dowry efink</i> is <i>nanti</i>, and the <i>bad style</i> and the <i>nix munjarlee</i> within: <i>she</i> that is in the field shall <i>cark it</i> with the <i>dowry efink</i>; and <i>she</i> that is in the <i>smoke</i>, <i>nix munjarlee</i> and <i>bad style</i> shall devour <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every <i>una</i> for <i>her</i> <i>codness</i>.

    <li>They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their <i>gelt</i> shall be removed: their silver and their <i>gelt</i> shall not be able to deliver them in the <i>journo</i> of the wrath of the <i>Duchess</i>: they shall not satisfy their <i>nishta lucoddies</i>, <i>nishta</i> fill their <i>chutney locker</i>: because it is the stumblingblock of their <i>codness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>As for the beauty of <i>her</i> ornament, <i>she</i> set it in <i>fabularity</i>: but they made the images of their <i>dowry cods</i> and of their detestable <i>fakements</i> therein: therefore have I set it <i>nishter ajax</i> them.

    <li>Wherefore I will <i>parker</i> the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their <i>latties</i>: I will also make the pomp of the <i>butch</i> to cease; and their <i>fabulosa</i> places shall be defiled.

    <li>The <i>dowriest homie</i> shall mourn, and the <i>princess</i> shall be clothed with desolation, and the <i>fambles</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i> of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I <i>beak</i> them; and they shall know that I am the <i>Duchess</i>.

    <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> in the <i>seyth</i> year, in the <i>seyth</i> month, in the fifth <i>journo</i> of the month, as I sat in mine <i>lattie</i>, and the <i>fungi</i> of Judah sat before me, that the <i>famble</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> fell there upon me.
    </li>
    <li>Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of <i>binco fakement</i>: from the appearance of <i>her</i> loins even downward, <i>binco fakement</i>; and from <i>her</i> loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of amber.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> put forth the form of an <i>famble</i>, and <i>lelled</i> me by a lock of mine <i>eke</i>; and the <i>Fairy</i> lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of <i>Gloria</i> to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that <i>varda-eth</i> toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy.
    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, the <i>fabeness</i> of the <i>Gloria</i> of Israel was there, according to the vision that I <i>vardad</i> in the plain.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i> unto me, <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, lift up thine <i>ogles</i> now the way toward the north. So I lifted up mine <i>ogles</i> the way toward the north, and <i>varda</i> northward at the gate of the <i>grovelling fakement</i> this image of jealousy in the entry.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> <i>cackled</i> furthermore unto me, <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, <i>vardest</i> thou what they do? even the <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry cods</i> that the <i>lattie</i> of Israel committeth here, that I should <i>troll</i> far off from my sanctuary? but turn thee yet again, and thou shalt <i>varda</i> <i>dowrier</i> <i>dowry cods</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, <i>varda</i> a hole in the wall.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i> unto me, <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, dig now in the wall: and when I had digged in the wall, <i>varda</i> a door.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, <i>troll</i> in, and <i>varda</i> the <i>naff</i> <i>dowry cods</i> that they do here.
    </li>
    <li>So I <i>trolled</i> in and <i>vardad</i>; and <i>varda</i> every form of creeping <i>fakements</i>, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the <i>lattie</i> of Israel, pourtrayed upon the wall round about.
    </li>
    <li>And there stood before them <i>setter dacha</i> <i>homies</i> of the ancients of the <i>lattie</i> of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Shaphan, with every <i>homie</i> <i>her</i> censer in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>; and a thick cloud of <i>smelly</i> <i>trolled</i> up.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i> unto me, <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, hast thou <i>vardad</i> what the ancients of the <i>lattie</i> of Israel do in the dark, every <i>homie</i> in the chambers of <i>her</i> imagery? for they <i>cackle</i>, the <i>Duchess</i> <i>vardaeth</i> us not; the <i>Duchess</i> hath forsaken the earth.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> <i>cackled</i> also unto me, Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt <i>varda</i> <i>dowrier</i> <i>dowry cods</i> that they do.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>she</i> brought me to the door of the gate of the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i> which was toward the north; and, <i>varda</i>, there sat <i>palones</i> weeping for Tammuz.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i> unto me, Hast thou <i>vardad</i> this, O <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>? turn thee yet again, and thou shalt <i>varda</i> <i>dowrier</i> <i>dowry cods</i> than these.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> brought me into the inner court of the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, and, <i>varda</i>, at the door of the <i>holy carsey</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, between the porch and the <i>grovelling fakement</i>, were about <i>chinker</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i> <i>homies</i>, with their backs toward the <i>holy carsey</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and their <i>ekes</i> toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east.

    <li>Then <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, Hast thou <i>vardad</i> this, O <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>? Is it a <i>sparkle</i> <i>fakement</i> to the <i>lattie</i> of Judah that they commit the <i>dowry cods</i> which they commit here? for they have filled the land with <i>slapping</i>, and have <i>trolled back to</i> provoke me to <i>wild</i>: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine <i>ogle</i> shall not spare, <i>nishta</i> will I have pity: and though they <i>screech</i> in mine <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> with a loud <i>cackling fakement</i>, yet will I not <i>aunt nell</i> them.

    <li>And to the others <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> in mine hearing, <i>troll</i> ye after <i>her</i> through the <i>smoke</i>, and <i>slap</i>: let not your <i>ogle</i> spare, <i>nishta</i> have ye pity:

    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Defile the <i>lattie</i>, and fill the courts with the <i>ferricadoozed</i>: <i>troll</i> ye forth. And they <i>trolled</i> forth, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> in the <i>smoke</i>.

    <li><i>Any road up</i>, while they were slaying them, and I was <i>dry</i>, that I fell upon my <i>eke</i>, and <i>screeched</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Ah <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>! wilt thou <i>battyfang</i> all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem?
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i> unto me, The <i>codness</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of Israel and Judah is exceeding <i>dowry</i>, and the land is full of blood, and the <i>smoke</i> full of perverseness: for they <i>cackle</i>, The <i>Duchess</i> hath forsaken the earth, and the <i>Duchess</i> <i>vardaeth</i> not.

    <li>And as for me also, mine <i>ogle</i> shall not spare, <i>nishta</i> will I have pity, but I will recompense their way upon their <i>eke</i>.

    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, the <i>homie</i> clothed with <i>lycra</i>, which had the inkhorn by <i>her</i> side, reported the matter, <i>cackling</i>, I have done as thou hast commanded me.

    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>homie</i> clothed with <i>lycra</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>troll</i> in between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill thine <i>famble</i> with coals of <i>binco fakement</i> from between the cherubims, and scatter them over the <i>smoke</i>.

    <li>Now the cherubims stood on the <i>sweet</i> side of the <i>lattie</i>, when the <i>homie</i> <i>trolled</i> in; and the cloud filled the inner court.

    <li>Then the <i>fabeness</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> up from the cherub, and stood over the threshold of the <i>lattie</i>; and the <i>lattie</i> was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s <i>fabeness</i>.

    <li>And the sound of the cherubims&#8217; wings was <i>aunt nelled</i> even to the outer court, as the <i>cackling fakement</i> of the <i>Dowry butch</i> <i>Gloria</i> when <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i>.

    <li><i>Any road up</i>, that when <i>she</i> had commanded the <i>homie</i> clothed with <i>lycra</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>lell</i> <i>binco fakement</i> from between the wheels, from between the cherubims; then <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> in, and stood beside the wheels.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>una</i> cherub stretched forth <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> from between the cherubims unto the <i>binco fakement</i> that was between the cherubims, and <i>lelled</i> thereof, and put it into the <i>fambles</i> of <i>her</i> that was clothed with <i>lycra</i>: who <i>lelled</i> it, and <i>trolled</i> out.
    </li>
    <li>And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a <i>homie</i>&#8216;s <i>famble</i> under their wings.
    </li>
    <li>And when I looked, <i>varda</i> the <i>quarter</i> wheels by the cherubims, <i>una</i> wheel by <i>una</i> cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone.
    </li>
    <li>And as for their appearances, they <i>quarter</i> had <i>una</i> likeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel.
    </li>
    <li>When they <i>trolled</i>, they <i>trolled</i> upon their <i>quarter</i> sides; they turned not as they <i>trolled</i>, but to the place whither the <i>eke</i> looked they <i>trolled after</i> it; they turned not as they <i>trolled</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And their whole <i>lucoddy</i>, and their backs, and their <i>fambles</i>, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of <i>ogles</i> round about, even the wheels that they <i>quarter</i> had.

    <li>As for the wheels, it was <i>screeched</i> unto them in my hearing, O wheel.
    </li>
    <li>And every <i>una</i> had <i>quarter</i> <i>ekes</i>: the first <i>eke</i> was the <i>eke</i> of a cherub, and the second <i>eke</i> was the <i>eke</i> of a <i>homie</i>, and the third the <i>eke</i> of a lion, and the <i>quarter</i> the <i>eke</i> of an eagle.

    <li>And the cherubims were lifted up. This is the living creature that I <i>vardad</i> by the river of Chebar.

    <li>When they stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up, these lifted up themselves also: for the <i>Fairy</i> of the living creature was in them.

    <li>Then the <i>fabeness</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled off</i> from off the threshold of the <i>lattie</i>, and stood over the cherubims.

    <li>And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my <i>vardaing</i>: when they <i>trolled</i> out, the wheels also were beside them, and every <i>una</i> stood at the door of the east gate of the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>; and the <i>fabeness</i> of the <i>Gloria</i> of Israel was over them above.

    <li>This is the living creature that I <i>vardad</i> under the <i>Gloria</i> of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they were the cherubims.

    <li>O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.

    <li>Ye have not <i>trolled</i> up into the gaps, <i>nishta</i> made up the hedge for the <i>lattie</i> of Israel to stand in the battle in the <i>journo</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.

    <li>Have ye not <i>vardad</i> a vain vision, and have ye not <i>cackled</i> a lying divination, whereas ye <i>cackle</i>, The <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackleth</i> it; albeit I have not <i>cackled</i>?

    <li>Thus wast thou decked with <i>gelt</i> and silver; and thy <i>clobber</i> was of <i>bona</i> <i>lycra</i>, and silk, and broidered <i>acting dickey</i>; thou didst <i>jarry</i> <i>bona</i> flour, and honey, and <i>lube</i>: and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst prosper into a kingdom.
    </li>
    <li>And thy renown <i>trolled</i> forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it was <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i> through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the <i>charvering donna</i> because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every <i>una</i> that <i>trolled by</i>; <i>her</i> it was.
    </li>
    <li>And of thy <i>frocks</i> thou didst <i>lell</i>, and deckedst thy high places with divers colours, and playedst the <i>charvering donna</i> thereupon: the like <i>fakements</i> shall not <i>troll</i>, <i>nishta</i> shall it be so.
    </li>
    <li>Thou hast also <i>lelled</i> thy <i>filly</i> <i>groinage</i> of my <i>gelt</i> and of my silver, which I had <i>parkered</i> thee, and madest to thyself images of <i>homies</i>, and didst commit <i>bitainedom</i> with them,
    </li>
    <li>And tookest thy broidered <i>frocks</i>, and coveredst them: and thou hast set mine <i>lube</i> and mine <i>smelly</i> before them.
    </li>
    <li>My <i>carnish</i> also which I <i>parkered</i> thee, <i>bona</i> flour, and <i>lube</i>, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou hast even set it before them for a <i>bona</i> savour: and thus it was, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover thou hast <i>lelled</i> thy <i>homie chavvies</i> and thy <i>palone chavvies</i>, whom thou hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. Is this of thy <i>bitainedoms</i> a <i>pogey</i> matter,
    </li>
    <li>That thou hast <i>ferricadoozed</i> my <i>chavvies</i>, and <i>laued</i> them to cause them to pass through the <i>binco fakement</i> for them?
    </li>
    <li>And in all thine <i>dowry cods</i> and thy <i>bitainedoms</i> thou hast not remembered the days of thy <i>beandom</i>, when thou wast <i>nanti zhoosh</i> and bare, and wast <i>dingy</i> in thy blood.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> after all thy <i>naffness</i>, (woe, woe unto thee! <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>😉
    </li>
    <li>That thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place, and hast made thee an high place in every street.
    </li>
    <li>Thou hast built thy high place at every <i>eke</i> of the way, and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy <i>plates</i> to every <i>una</i> that <i>trolled by</i>, and multiplied thy <i>bitainedoms</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thou hast also committed <i>charvering</i> with the Egyptians thy neighbours, <i>dowry</i> of flesh; and hast increased thy <i>bitainedoms</i>, to provoke me to <i>wild</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, therefore I have stretched out my <i>famble</i> over thee, and have diminished thine ordinary <i>manjarry</i>, and <i>laued</i> thee unto the will of them that hate thee, the <i>palone chavvies</i> of the <i>naffs</i>, which are ashamed of thy lewd way.
    </li>
    <li>Thou hast played the <i>bitaine</i> also with the Assyrians, because thou wast unsatiable; <i>any road up</i>, thou hast played the <i>charvering donna</i> with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied.
    </li>
    <li>Thou hast moreover multiplied thy <i>charvering</i> in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied therewith.
    </li>
    <li>How <i>nelly</i> is thine <i>thumping cheat</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>, <i>vardaing</i> thou doest all these <i>fakements</i>, the <i>acting dickey</i> of an imperious whorish <i>palone</i>;
    </li>
    <li>In that thou buildest thine eminent place in the <i>eke</i> of every way, and makest thine high place in every street; and hast not been as an <i>charvering donna</i>, in that thou scornest hire;
    </li>
    <li>But as a <i>palone affair</i> that committeth adultery, which <i>lelleth</i> strangers instead of her <i>homie affair</i>!
    </li>
    <li>They <i>parker</i> gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to all thy <i>affairs</i>, and hirest them, that they may <i>troll</i> unto thee on every side for thy <i>bitainedom</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the contrary is in thee from other <i>palones</i> in thy <i>bitainedoms</i>, whereas none followeth thee to commit <i>bitainedoms</i>: and in that thou givest a <i>parkering</i>, and no <i>parkering</i> is <i>parkered</i> unto thee, therefore thou art contrary.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore, O <i>charvering donna</i>, <i>aunt nell</i> the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>; Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy <i>nanti zhoosh</i> discovered through thy <i>bitainedoms</i> with thy <i>affairs</i>, and with all the idols of thy <i>dowry cods</i>, and by the blood of thy <i>chavvies</i>, which thou didst <i>parker</i> unto them;
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, therefore I will gather all thy <i>affairs</i>, with whom thou hast <i>lelled</i> pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about against thee, and will discover thy <i>nanti zhoosh</i> unto them, that they may <i>varda</i> all thy <i>nanti zhoosh</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And I will <i>beak</i> thee, as <i>palones</i> that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will <i>parker</i> thee blood in fury and jealousy.
    </li>
    <li>And I will also <i>parker</i> thee into their <i>famble</i>, and they shall throw down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: they shall strip thee also of thy <i>zhoosh</i>, and shall <i>lell</i> thy <i>filly</i> <i>groinage</i>, and leave thee <i>nanti zhoosh</i> and bare.
    </li>
    <li>They shall also <i>parker</i> up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their <i>dowry efinks</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they shall burn thine <i>latties</i> with <i>binco fakement</i>, and execute judgments upon thee in the <i>vardaing</i> of many <i>palones</i>: and I will cause thee to cease from playing the <i>charvering donna</i>, and thou also shalt <i>parker</i> no hire any more.
    </li>
    <li>So will I make my fury toward thee to <i>lettie</i>, and my jealousy shall <i>troll off</i> from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be <i>nishta</i> angry.
    </li>
    <li>Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy <i>beandom</i>, but hast fretted me in all these <i>fakements</i>; <i>varda</i>, therefore I also will recompense thy way upon thine <i>eke</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>: and <i>nishta</i> commit this lewdness above all thine <i>dowry cods</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, every <i>una</i> that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee, <i>cackling</i>, As is the mother, so is her <i>palone chavvie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thou art thy mother&#8217;s <i>palone chavvie</i>, that lotheth her <i>homie affair</i> and her <i>chavvies</i>; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, which lothed their <i>homie affairs</i> and their <i>chavvies</i>: your mother was an Hittite, and your <i>Auntie</i> an Amorite.
    </li>
    <li>And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her <i>palone chavvies</i> that <i>lett</i> at thy <i>dry martini</i>: and thy younger sister, that <i>letteth</i> at thy <i>sweet martini</i>, is Sodom and her <i>palone chavvies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Yet hast thou not <i>minced</i> after their ways, <i>nishta</i> done after their <i>dowry cods</i>: but, as if that were a <i>dowry</i> <i>bijou</i> <i>fakement</i>, thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways.
    </li>
    <li>As I live, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she <i>nishta</i> her <i>palone chavvies</i>, as thou hast done, thou and thy <i>palone chavvies</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, this was the <i>codness</i> of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of <i>pannan</i>, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her <i>palone chavvies</i>, <i>nishta</i> did she strengthen the <i>famble</i> of the <i>nanti dinarly</i> and needy.
    </li>
    <li>And they were haughty, and committed <i>dowry cod</i> before me: therefore I <i>lelled</i> them away as I <i>vardad</i> <i>bona</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Nishta</i> hath Samaria committed half of thy <i>kertervers</i>; but thou hast multiplied thine <i>dowry cods</i> more than they, and hast justified thy sisters in all thine <i>dowry cods</i> which thou hast done.
    </li>
    <li>Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own <i>scharda</i> for thy <i>kertervers</i> that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they are more <i>bona</i> than thou: <i>any road up</i>, be thou <i>bamboozled</i> also, and bear thy <i>scharda</i>, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.
    </li>
    <li>When I shall <i>parker</i> again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her <i>palone chavvies</i>, and the captivity of Samaria and her <i>palone chavvies</i>, then will I <i>parker</i> again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them:
    </li>
    <li>That thou mayest bear thine own <i>scharda</i>, and mayest be <i>bamboozled</i> in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.
    </li>
    <li>When thy sisters, Sodom and her <i>palone chavvies</i>, shall <i>troll back to</i> their former estate, and Samaria and her <i>palone chavvies</i> shall <i>troll back to</i> their former estate, then thou and thy <i>palone chavvies</i> shall <i>troll back to</i> your former estate.
    </li>
    <li>For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy <i>screech</i> in the <i>journo</i> of thy pride,
    </li>
    <li>Before thy <i>naffness</i> was discovered, as at the time of thy reproach of the <i>palone chavvies</i> of Syria, and all that are round about her, the <i>palone chavvies</i> of the <i>naffs</i>, which despise thee round about.
    </li>
    <li>Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine <i>dowry cods</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy <i>beandom</i>, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.
    </li>
    <li>Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt <i>lall</i> thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will <i>parker</i> them unto thee for <i>palone chavvies</i>, but not by thy covenant.
    </li>
    <li>And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am the <i>Duchess</i>:
    </li>
    <li>That thou mayest remember, and be <i>bamboozled</i>, and never open thy <i>screech</i> any more because of thy <i>scharda</i>, when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>.

    <h2>Chapter 17</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> unto me, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, put forth a riddle, and <i>cackle</i> a parable unto the <i>lattie</i> of Israel;
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackle</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>; A <i>dowry</i> eagle with <i>dowry</i> wings, longwinged, full of feathers, which had divers colours, <i>trolled</i> unto Lebanon, and <i>lelled</i> the highest branch of the cedar:
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> cropped off the top of <i>her</i> <i>bean</i> twigs, and <i>lelled</i> it into a land of traffick; <i>she</i> set it in a <i>smoke</i> of <i>bodega homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> <i>lelled</i> also of the <i>maria</i> of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field; <i>she</i> placed it by <i>dowry</i> <i>aquas</i>, and set it as a willow tree.
    </li>
    <li>And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward <i>her</i>, and the roots thereof were under <i>her</i>: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.
    </li>
    <li>There was also another <i>dowry</i> eagle with <i>dowry</i> wings and many feathers: and, <i>varda</i>, this vine did bend her roots toward <i>her</i>, and shot forth her branches toward <i>her</i>, that <i>she</i> might <i>aqua</i> it by the furrows of her plantation.
    </li>
    <li>It was planted in a <i>bona</i> soil by <i>dowry</i> <i>aquas</i>, that it might <i>parker</i> forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine.
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackle</i> thou, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>; Shall it prosper? shall <i>she</i> not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it wither? it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring, even <i>nanti</i> <i>dowry</i> power or many <i>homies and palones</i> to pluck it up by the roots thereof.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, <i>varda</i>, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind <i>reefeth</i> it? it shall wither in the furrows where it grew.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> unto me, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackle</i> now to the rebellious <i>lattie</i>, Know ye not what these <i>fakements</i> mean? <i>cackle</i> them, <i>varda</i>, the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon is <i>troll</i> to Jerusalem, and hath <i>lelled</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> thereof, and the <i>princesses</i> thereof, and led them with <i>her</i> to Babylon;
    </li>
    <li>And hath <i>lelled</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>maria</i>, and made a covenant with <i>her</i>, and hath <i>lelled</i> an oath of <i>her</i>: <i>she</i> hath also <i>lelled</i> the <i>dowry butch</i> of the land:
    </li>
    <li>That the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping of <i>her</i> covenant it might stand.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> rebelled against <i>her</i> in sending <i>her</i> ambassadors into Egypt, that they might <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> horses and <i>dowry</i> <i>homies and palones</i>. Shall <i>she</i> prosper? shall <i>she</i> escape that doeth such <i>fakements</i>? or shall <i>she</i> break the covenant, and be <i>laued</i>?
    </li>
    <li>As I live, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>, surely in the place where the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>letteth</i> that made <i>her</i> <i>dowriest homie</i>, whose oath <i>she</i> despised, and whose covenant <i>she</i> brake, even with <i>her</i> in the midst of Babylon <i>she</i> shall <i>cark it</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Nishta</i> shall Pharaoh with <i>her</i> <i>dowry butch</i> army and <i>dowry</i> company make for <i>her</i> in the <i>barney</i>, by <i>chucking</i> up mounts, and building forts, to cut off many persons:
    </li>
    <li><i>Vardaing</i> <i>she</i> despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, <i>she</i> had <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>, and hath done all these <i>fakements</i>, <i>she</i> shall not escape.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>; As I live, surely mine oath that <i>she</i> hath despised, and my covenant that <i>she</i> hath broken, even it will I recompense upon <i>her</i> own <i>eke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And I will spread my net upon <i>her</i>, and <i>she</i> shall be <i>lelled</i> in my snare, and I will <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> to Babylon, and will plead with <i>her</i> there for <i>her</i> <i>caterver</i> that <i>she</i> hath trespassed against me.
    </li>
    <li>And all <i>her</i> <i>gajos</i> with all <i>her</i> bands shall fall by the <i>dowry efink</i>, and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds: and ye shall know that I the <i>Duchess</i> have <i>cackled</i> it.
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>; I will also <i>lell</i> of the highest branch of the high cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the top of <i>her</i> <i>bean</i> twigs a tender <i>una</i>, and will plant it upon an high mountain and eminent:
    </li>
    <li>In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and it shall <i>parker</i> forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall <i>lett</i> all fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they <i>lett</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And all the trees of the field shall know that I the <i>Duchess</i> have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the <i>Duchess</i> have <i>cackled</i> and have done it.

    <li>The <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> unto me again, <i>cackling</i>,

    <li>What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, <i>cackling</i>, The <i>aunties</i> have <i>jarried</i> sour grapes, and the <i>chavvies</i>&#8216;s <i>hampsteads</i> are set on edge?
    </li>
    <li>As I live, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>, <i>nanti</i> have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel.

    <li><i>Varda</i>, all <i>nishta lucoddies</i> are mine; as the <i>nishta lucoddy</i> of the <i>Auntie</i>, so also the <i>nishta lucoddy</i> of the <i>homie chavvie</i> is mine: the <i>nishta lucoddy</i> that <i>kertervereth</i>, it shall <i>cark it</i>.

    <li>And hath not oppressed any, but hath restored to the debtor <i>her</i> pledge, hath spoiled none by <i>slapping</i>, hath <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> <i>pannan</i> to the hungry, and hath covered the <i>nanti zhoosh</i> with a <i>frock</i>;
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> that hath not <i>parkered</i> forth upon usury, <i>nishta</i> hath <i>lelled</i> any increase, that hath withdrawn <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> from <i>codness</i>, hath executed true judgment between <i>homie</i> and <i>homie</i>,

    <li>If <i>she</i> beget a <i>homie chavvie</i> that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that doeth the like to any <i>una</i> of these <i>fakements</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And that doeth not any of those duties, but even hath <i>jarried</i> upon the mountains, and defiled <i>her</i> <i>homie ajax</i>&#8216;s <i>palone affair</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Hath oppressed the <i>nanti dinarly</i> and needy, hath spoiled by <i>slapping</i>, hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i> to the idols, hath committed <i>dowry cod</i>,

    <li>Hath <i>parkered</i> forth upon usury, and hath <i>lelled</i> increase: shall <i>she</i> then live? <i>she</i> shall not live: <i>she</i> hath done all these <i>dowry cods</i>; <i>she</i> shall surely <i>cark it</i>; <i>her</i> blood shall be upon <i>her</i>.

    <li>As for <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, because <i>she</i> cruelly oppressed, spoiled <i>her</i> <i>sister</i> by <i>slapping</i>, and did that which is not <i>bona</i> among <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, lo, even <i>she</i> shall <i>cark it</i> in <i>her</i> <i>codness</i>.

    <li>The <i>nishta lucoddy</i> that <i>kertervereth</i>, it shall <i>cark it</i>.

    <li>But if the <i>naff</i> will turn from all <i>her</i> <i>kertervers</i> that <i>she</i> hath committed, and keep all my <i>dowry lavs</i>, and do that which is lawful and <i>sweet</i>, <i>she</i> shall surely live, <i>she</i> shall not <i>cark it</i>.

    <li>But when the <i>bona</i> turneth away from <i>her</i> <i>bonaness</i>, and committeth <i>codness</i>, and doeth according to all the <i>dowry cods</i> that the <i>naff</i> <i>homie</i> doeth, shall <i>she</i> live? All <i>her</i> <i>bonaness</i> that <i>she</i> hath done shall not be mentioned: in <i>her</i> <i>caterver</i> that <i>she</i> hath trespassed, and in <i>her</i> <i>kertever</i> that <i>she</i> hath <i>kertervered</i>, in them shall <i>she</i> <i>cark it</i>.

    <li>Therefore I will <i>beak</i> you, O <i>lattie</i> of Israel, every <i>una</i> according to <i>her</i> ways, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>. Repent, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so <i>codness</i> shall not be your ruin.

    <li>Moreover <i>lell</i> thou up a lamentation for the <i>princesses</i> of Israel,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackle</i>, What is thy mother? A lioness: she <i>lett</i> down among lions, she nourished her whelps among <i>bean</i> lions.
    </li>
    <li>And she brought up <i>una</i> of her whelps: it became a <i>bean</i> lion, and it learned to catch the prey; it devoured <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The nations also <i>aunt nelled</i> of <i>her</i>; <i>she</i> was <i>lelled</i> in their pit, and they brought <i>her</i> with chains unto the land of Egypt.
    </li>
    <li>Now when she <i>vardad</i> that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she <i>lelled</i> another of her whelps, and made <i>her</i> a <i>bean</i> lion.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> up and down among the lions, <i>she</i> became a <i>bean</i> lion, and learned to catch the prey, and devoured <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> knew their desolate <i>dowry latties</i>, and <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> waste their <i>smokes</i>; and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, by the <i>screech</i> of <i>her</i> <i>butch shrieking</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then the nations set against <i>her</i> on every side from the provinces, and spread their net over <i>her</i>: <i>she</i> was <i>lelled</i> in their pit.
    </li>
    <li>And they put <i>her</i> in ward in chains, and brought <i>her</i> to the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon: they brought <i>her</i> into holds, that <i>her</i> <i>cackling fakement</i> should <i>nishta</i> be <i>aunt nelled</i> upon the mountains of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>Thy mother is like a vine in thy blood, planted by the <i>aquas</i>: she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many <i>aquas</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And she had <i>butch</i> rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule, and her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches.
    </li>
    <li>But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit: her <i>butch</i> rods were broken and withered; the <i>binco fakement</i> consumed them.
    </li>
    <li>And now she is planted in the <i>nishta smoke</i>, in a dry and thirsty ground.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>binco fakement</i> is <i>trolled</i> out of a rod of her branches, which hath devoured her fruit, so that she hath no <i>butch</i> rod to be a <i>choad</i> to rule. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.

    <li><i>Any road up</i> in the <i>setterth</i> year, in the fifth month, the <i>dachath</i> <i>journo</i> of the month, that certain of the <i>fungi</i> of Israel <i>trolled</i> to enquire of the <i>Duchess</i>, and sat before me.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>trolled</i> the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> unto me, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, <i>cackle</i> unto the <i>fungi</i> of Israel, and <i>cackle</i> unto them, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>; Are ye <i>troll</i> to enquire of me?

    </li>
    <li>Wilt thou <i>beak</i> them, <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, wilt thou <i>beak</i> them? cause them to know the <i>dowry cods</i> of their <i>aunties</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackle</i> unto them, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>; In the <i>journo</i> when I chose Israel, and lifted up mine <i>famble</i> unto the <i>maria</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up mine <i>famble</i> unto them, <i>cackling</i>, I am the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i>;
    </li>
    <li>In the <i>journo</i> that I lifted up mine <i>famble</i> unto them, to <i>parker</i> them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with <i>gin and tonic</i>, which is the <i>fabeness</i> of all lands:
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> I unto them, Cast ye away every <i>homie</i> the <i>dowry cods</i> of <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i>, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But they rebelled against me, and would not <i>aunt nell</i> unto me: they did not every <i>homie</i> cast away the <i>dowry cods</i> of their <i>ogles</i>, <i>nishta</i> did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I <i>cackled</i>, I will pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my <i>wild</i> against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
    </li>
    <li>But I wrought for my name&#8217;s sake, that it should not be <i>dingy</i> before the heathen, among whom they were, in whose <i>vardaing</i> I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore I caused them to <i>troll forth</i> out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the <i>nishta smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>parkered</i> them my <i>dowry lavs</i>, and shewed them my judgments, which if a <i>homie</i> do, <i>she</i> shall even live in them.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover also I <i>parkered</i> them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the <i>Duchess</i> that <i>bonafy</i> them.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>lattie</i> of Israel rebelled against me in the <i>nishta smoke</i>: they <i>minced</i> not in my <i>dowry lavs</i>, and they despised my judgments, which if a <i>homie</i> do, <i>she</i> shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly <i>dingy</i>: then I <i>cackled</i>, I would pour out my fury upon them in the <i>nishta smoke</i>, to consume them.
    </li>
    <li>But I wrought for my name&#8217;s sake, that it should not be <i>dingy</i> before the heathen, in whose <i>vardaing</i> I brought them out.
    </li>
    <li>Yet also I lifted up my <i>famble</i> unto them in the <i>nishta smoke</i>, that I would not <i>parker</i> them into the land which I had <i>parkered</i> them, flowing with <i>gin and tonic</i>, which is the <i>fabeness</i> of all lands;
    </li>
    <li>Because they despised my judgments, and <i>minced</i> not in my <i>dowry lavs</i>, but <i>dingy</i> my sabbaths: for their <i>thumping cheat</i> <i>trolled</i> after their idols.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> mine <i>ogle</i> spared them from destroying them, <i>nishta</i> did I make an end of them in the <i>nishta smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But I <i>cackled</i> unto their <i>chavvies</i> in the <i>nishta smoke</i>, <i>mince</i> ye not in the <i>dowry lavs</i> of your <i>aunties</i>, <i>nishta</i> observe their judgments, <i>nishta</i> defile yourselves with their idols:

    <li>I am the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i>; <i>mince</i> in my <i>dowry lavs</i>, and keep my judgments, and do them;

    <li>And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Notwithstanding the <i>chavvies</i> rebelled against me: they <i>minced</i> not in my <i>dowry lavs</i>, <i>nishta</i> kept my judgments to do them, which if a <i>homie</i> do, <i>she</i> shall even live in them; they <i>dingy</i> my sabbaths: then I <i>cackled</i>, I would pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my <i>wild</i> against them in the <i>nishta smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> I withdrew mine <i>famble</i>, and wrought for my name&#8217;s sake, that it should not be <i>dingy</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the heathen, in whose <i>vardaing</i> I brought them forth.
    </li>
    <li>I lifted up mine <i>famble</i> unto them also in the <i>nishta smoke</i>, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries;
    </li>
    <li>Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my <i>dowry lavs</i>, and had <i>dingy</i> my sabbaths, and their <i>ogles</i> were after their <i>aunties</i>&#8216; idols.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore I <i>parkered</i> them also <i>dowry lavs</i> that were not <i>bona</i>, and judgments whereby they should not live;
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>dingy</i> them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through the <i>binco fakement</i> all that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore, <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, <i>cackle</i> unto the <i>lattie</i> of Israel, and <i>cackle</i> unto them, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>; Yet in this your <i>aunties</i> have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a <i>caterver</i> against me.
    </li>
    <li>For when I had brought them into the land, for the which I lifted up mine <i>famble</i> to <i>parker</i> it to them, then they <i>vardad</i> every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their <i>parkers</i>, and there they presented the provocation of their <i>parkering</i>: there also they made their <i>bona</i> savour, and poured out there their <i>buvare</i> <i>parkerings</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then I <i>cackled</i> unto them, What is the high place whereunto ye <i>troll</i>? And the name whereof is <i>screeched</i> Bamah unto this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore <i>cackle</i> unto the <i>lattie</i> of Israel, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>; Are ye <i>dingy</i> after the manner of your <i>aunties</i>? and commit ye <i>bitainedom</i> after their <i>dowry cods</i>?
    </li>
    <li>For when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your <i>homie chavvies</i> to pass through the <i>binco fakement</i>, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, even unto this <i>journo</i>: and shall I be enquired of by you, O <i>lattie</i> of Israel? As I live, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>, I will not be enquired of by you.
    </li>
    <li>And that which <i>trolleth</i> into your mind shall not be at all, that ye <i>cackle</i>, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.
    </li>
    <li>As I live, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>, surely with a <i>dowry butch</i> <i>famble</i>, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you:
    </li>
    <li>And I will <i>parker</i> you out from the <i>homies and palones</i>, and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a <i>dowry butch</i> <i>famble</i>, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.
    </li>
    <li>And I will <i>parker</i> you into the <i>nishta smoke</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i>, and there will I plead with you <i>eke</i> to <i>eke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Like as I pleaded with your <i>aunties</i> in the <i>nishta smoke</i> of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will <i>parker</i> you into the bond of the covenant:
    </li>
    <li>And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me: I will <i>parker</i> them forth out of the country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I am the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>As for you, O <i>lattie</i> of Israel, thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>; <i>troll</i> ye, serve ye every <i>una</i> <i>her</i> idols, and hereafter also, if ye will not <i>aunt nell</i> unto me: but pollute ye my <i>fabulosa</i> name <i>nishta</i> with your gifts, and with your idols.
    </li>
    <li>For in mine <i>fabulosa</i> mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>, there shall all the <i>lattie</i> of Israel, all of them in the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there will I require your <i>parkerings</i>, and the firstfruits of your oblations, with all your <i>fabulosa</i> <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I will accept you with your <i>bona</i> savour, when I <i>parker</i> you out from the <i>homies and palones</i>, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen.
    </li>
    <li>And ye shall know that I am the <i>Duchess</i>, when I shall <i>parker</i> you into the land of Israel, into the country for the which I lifted up mine <i>famble</i> to <i>parker</i> it to your <i>aunties</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own <i>vardaing</i> for all your <i>nanas</i> that ye have committed.
    </li>
    <li>And ye shall know that I am the <i>Duchess</i> when I have wrought with you for my name&#8217;s sake, not according to your <i>naff</i> ways, <i>nishta</i> according to your corrupt doings, O ye <i>lattie</i> of Israel, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> unto me, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, set thy <i>eke</i> toward the south, and drop thy <i>lav</i> toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field;

    <li>And <i>cackle</i> to the forest of the south, <i>aunt nell</i> the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>; Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>; <i>varda</i>, I will kindle a <i>binco fakement</i> in thee, and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all <i>ekes</i> from the south to the north shall be burned therein.
    </li>
    <li>And all flesh shall <i>varda</i> that I the <i>Duchess</i> have kindled it: it shall not be quenched.

    <li><i>Vardaing</i> then that I will cut off from thee the <i>bona</i> and the <i>naff</i>, therefore shall my <i>dowry efink</i> <i>troll forth</i> out of <i>her</i> sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:

    <li>That all flesh may know that I the <i>Duchess</i> have drawn forth my <i>dowry efink</i> out of <i>her</i> sheath: it shall not return any more.

    <li>And it shall be, when they <i>cackle</i> unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it <i>trolleth</i>: and every <i>thumping cheat</i> shall melt, and all <i>fambles</i> shall be feeble, and every <i>Fairy</i> shall faint, and all knees shall be <i>nelly</i> as <i>aqua</i>: <i>varda</i>, it <i>trolleth</i>, and shall be brought to pass, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>.

    <li>It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make mirth? it contemneth the rod of my <i>homie chavvie</i>, as every tree.

    <li>And <i>she</i> hath <i>parkered</i> it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this <i>dowry efink</i> is sharpened, and it is furbished, to <i>parker</i> it into the <i>famble</i> of the slayer.

    <li><i>Screech</i> and howl, <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>: for it shall be upon my <i>homies and palones</i>, it shall be upon all the <i>princesses</i> of Israel: terrors by reason of the <i>dowry efink</i> shall be upon my <i>homies and palones</i>: <i>slap</i> therefore upon thy thigh.

    <li>Thou therefore, <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, prophesy, and <i>slap</i> thine <i>fambles</i> together. and let the <i>dowry efink</i> be doubled the third time, the <i>dowry efink</i> of the <i>ferricadoozed</i>: it is the <i>dowry efink</i> of the <i>dowry</i> <i>homies</i> that are <i>ferricadoozed</i>, which entereth into their privy chambers.
    </li>
    <li>I have set the point of the <i>dowry efink</i> against all their gates, that their <i>thumping cheat</i> may faint, and their ruins be multiplied: ah! it is made bright, it is wrapped up for the slaughter.

    <li><i>Troll</i> thee <i>una</i> way or other, either on the <i>sweet martini</i>, or on the <i>dry</i>, whithersoever thy <i>eke</i> is set.

    <li>The <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> unto me again, <i>cackling</i>,

    <li>Also, thou <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, appoint thee <i>dewey</i> ways, that the <i>dowry efink</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon may <i>troll</i>: both twain shall <i>troll</i> forth out of <i>una</i> land: and choose thou a place, choose it at the <i>eke</i> of the way to the <i>smoke</i>.

    <li>Appoint a way, that the <i>dowry efink</i> may <i>troll</i> to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced.

    <li>At <i>her</i> <i>sweet martini</i> was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the <i>screech</i> in the slaughter, to lift up the <i>cackling fakement</i> with <i>screeching</i>, to appoint battering rams against the gates, to cast a mount, and to build a fort.
    </li>
    <li>And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their <i>vardaing</i>, to them that have sworn oaths: but <i>she</i> will <i>screech</i> to remembrance the <i>codness</i>, that they may be <i>lelled</i>.

    <li>Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art <i>troll</i> even unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen, and a mocking to all countries.

    <li>As they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the <i>binco fakement</i> upon it, to melt it; so will I gather you in mine <i>wild</i> and in my fury, and I will leave you there, and melt you.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the <i>binco fakement</i> of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst therof.

    <li>As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the <i>Duchess</i> have poured out my fury upon you.

    <li>And the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> unto me, <i>cackling</i>,

    <li><i>Homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, <i>cackle</i> unto her, Thou art the land that is not cleansed, <i>nishta</i> rained upon in the <i>journo</i> of indignation.
    </li>
    <li>There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a <i>butch shrieking</i> lion ravening the prey; they have devoured <i>nishta lucoddies</i>; they have <i>lelled</i> the <i>gelt</i> and precious <i>fakements</i>; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof.
    </li>
    <li>Her <i>godly homies</i> have violated my law, and have <i>billingsgated</i> mine <i>fabulosa</i> <i>fakements</i>: they have put no difference between the <i>fabulosa</i> and <i>billingsgate</i>, <i>nishta</i> have they shewed difference between the <i>nanti sparkle</i> and the clean, and have hid their <i>ogles</i> from my sabbaths, and I am <i>billingsgated</i> among them.
    </li>
    <li>Her <i>princesses</i> in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to <i>battyfang</i> <i>nishta lucoddies</i>, to get dishonest gain.
    </li>
    <li>And her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter, <i>vardaing</i> <i>spangly</i>, and divining lies unto them, <i>cackling</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>, when the <i>Duchess</i> hath not <i>cackled</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>homies and palones</i> of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the <i>nanti dinarly</i> and needy: <i>any road up</i>, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully.
    </li>
    <li>And I sought for a <i>homie</i> among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not <i>battyfang</i> it: but I found none.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the <i>binco fakement</i> of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their <i>ekes</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>.

    <h2>Chapter 23</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>The <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> again unto me, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, there were <i>dewey</i> <i>palones</i>, the <i>palone chavvies</i> of <i>una</i> mother:
    </li>
    <li>And they committed <i>bitainedoms</i> in Egypt; they committed <i>bitainedoms</i> in their <i>beandom</i>: there were their <i>foofs</i> pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity.
    </li>
    <li>And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bare <i>homie chavvies</i> and <i>palone chavvies</i>. Thus were their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.
    </li>
    <li>And Aholah played the <i>charvering donna</i> when she was mine; and she doted on her <i>affairs</i>, on the Assyrians her neighbours,
    </li>
    <li>Which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable <i>bean coves</i>, horsemen riding upon horses.
    </li>
    <li>Thus she committed her <i>bitainedoms</i> with them, with all them that were the chosen <i>homies</i> of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.
    </li>
    <li><i>Nishta</i> <i>dry</i> she her <i>bitainedoms</i> brought from Egypt: for in her <i>beandom</i> they <i>lett</i> with her, and they bruised the <i>foofs</i> of her virginity, and poured their <i>bitainedom</i> upon her.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore I have <i>laued</i> her into the <i>famble</i> of her <i>affairs</i>, into the <i>famble</i> of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.
    </li>
    <li>These discovered her <i>nanti zhoosh</i>: they <i>lelled</i> her <i>homie chavvies</i> and her <i>palone chavvies</i>, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> her with the <i>dowry efink</i>: and she became famous among <i>palones</i>; for they had executed judgment upon her.
    </li>
    <li>And when her sister Aholibah <i>vardad</i> this, she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her <i>bitainedoms</i> more than her sister in her <i>bitainedoms</i>.
    </li>
    <li>She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and rulers clothed most <i>fabely</i>, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable <i>bean coves</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then I <i>vardad</i> that she was defiled, that they <i>lelled</i> both <i>una</i> way,
    </li>
    <li>And that she increased her <i>bitainedoms</i>: for when she <i>vardad</i> <i>homies</i> pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion,
    </li>
    <li>Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their <i>ekes</i>, all of them <i>princesses</i> to <i>varda</i> to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:
    </li>
    <li>And as soon as she <i>vardad</i> them with her <i>ogles</i>, she doted upon them, and <i>laued</i> messengers unto them into Chaldea.
    </li>
    <li>And the Babylonians <i>trolled</i> to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their <i>bitainedom</i>, and she was <i>dingy</i> with them, and her mind was alienated from them.
    </li>
    <li>So she discovered her <i>bitainedoms</i>, and discovered her <i>nanti zhoosh</i>: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister.
    </li>
    <li>Yet she multiplied her <i>bitainedoms</i>, in calling to remembrance the days of her <i>beandom</i>, wherein she had played the <i>charvering donna</i> in the land of Egypt.
    </li>
    <li>For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.
    </li>
    <li>Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy <i>beandom</i>, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy <i>beandom</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore, O Aholibah, thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>; <i>varda</i>, I will raise up thy <i>affairs</i> against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will <i>parker</i> them against thee on every side;
    </li>
    <li>The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable <i>bean coves</i>, captains and rulers, <i>dowry</i> <i>ladies</i> and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.
    </li>
    <li>And they shall <i>troll</i> against thee with <i>rattling coves</i>, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of <i>homies and palones</i>, which shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall <i>beak</i> thee according to their judgments.
    </li>
    <li>And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall <i>lell</i> away thy nose and thine <i>aunt nelly cheats</i>; and thy remnant shall fall by the <i>dowry efink</i>: they shall <i>lell</i> thy <i>homie chavvies</i> and thy <i>palone chavvies</i>; and thy residue shall be devoured by the <i>binco fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>They shall also strip thee out of thy <i>zhoosh</i>, and <i>lell</i> away thy <i>filly</i> <i>groinage</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy <i>bitainedom</i> brought from the land of Egypt: so that <i>nishta</i> lift up thine <i>ogles</i> unto them, <i>nishta</i> remember Egypt any more.
    </li>
    <li>For thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>; <i>varda</i>, I will deliver thee into the <i>famble</i> of them whom thou hatest, into the <i>famble</i> of them from whom thy mind is alienated:
    </li>
    <li>And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall <i>lell</i> away all thy <i>acting dickey</i>, and shall leave thee <i>nanti zhoosh</i> and bare: and the <i>nanti zhoosh</i> of thy <i>bitainedoms</i> shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy <i>bitainedoms</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I will do these <i>fakements</i> unto thee, because thou hast <i>trolled</i> a <i>bitaining</i> after the heathen, and because thou art <i>dingy</i> with their idols.
    </li>
    <li>Thou hast <i>minced</i> in the way of thy sister; therefore will I <i>parker</i> her cup into thine <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>; Thou shalt <i>buvare</i> of thy sister&#8217;s cup deep and large: thou shalt be <i>tittered</i> to scorn and had in derision; it containeth <i>dowry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thou shalt be filled with <i>daffiness</i> and <i>sharda</i>, with the cup of <i>gobsmacked-ness</i> and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.
    </li>
    <li>Thou shalt even <i>buvare</i> it and suck it out, and thou shalt break the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own <i>foofs</i>: for I have <i>cackled</i> it, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>; Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy <i>bitainedoms</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> moreover unto me; <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, wilt thou <i>beak</i> Aholah and Aholibah? <i>any road up</i>, <i>screech</i> unto them their <i>dowry cods</i>;
    </li>
    <li>That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their <i>fambles</i>, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their <i>homie chavvies</i>, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through the <i>binco fakement</i>, to devour them.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same <i>journo</i>, and have <i>billingsgated</i> my sabbaths.
    </li>
    <li>For when they had <i>ferricadoozed</i> their <i>chavvies</i> to their idols, then they <i>trolled</i> the same <i>journo</i> into my sanctuary to <i>billingsgate</i> it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And furthermore, that ye have <i>laued</i> for <i>homies</i> to <i>troll</i> from far, unto whom a messenger was <i>laued</i>; and, lo, they <i>trolled</i>: for whom thou didst <i>dhobie</i> thyself, paintedst thy <i>ogles</i>, and deckedst thyself with ornaments,
    </li>
    <li>And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon thou hast set mine <i>smelly</i> and mine <i>lube</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And a <i>cackling fakement</i> of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with the <i>homies</i> of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the <i>nishta smoke</i>, which put <i>groinnage</i> upon their <i>fambles</i>, and beautiful crowns upon their <i>ekes</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> I unto her that was <i>badge</i> in adulteries, Will they now commit <i>bitainedoms</i> with her, and she with them?
    </li>
    <li>Yet they <i>trolled</i> in unto her, as they <i>troll</i> in unto a <i>palone</i> that playeth the <i>charvering donna</i>: so <i>trolled</i> they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd <i>palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>bona</i> <i>homies</i>, they shall <i>beak</i> them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of <i>palones</i> that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their <i>fambles</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>; I will <i>parker</i> up a company upon them, and will <i>parker</i> them to be removed and spoiled.
    </li>
    <li>And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their <i>dowry efinks</i>; they shall <i>ferricadooza</i> their <i>homie chavvies</i> and their <i>palone chavvies</i>, and burn up their <i>latties</i> with <i>binco fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all <i>palones</i> may be taught not to do after your lewdness.
    </li>
    <li>And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the <i>kertervers</i> of your idols: and ye shall know that I am the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>.

    <h2>Chapter 24</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Again in the ninth year, in the <i>dachath</i> month, in the <i>dachath</i> <i>journo</i> of the month, the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> unto me, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, <i>screeve</i> thee the name of the <i>journo</i>, even of this same <i>journo</i>: the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And utter a parable unto the rebellious <i>lattie</i>, and <i>cackle</i> unto them, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>; Set on a pot, set it on, and also pour <i>aqua</i> into it:
    </li>
    <li>Gather the pieces thereof into it, even every <i>bona</i> piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.
    </li>
    <li><i>Lell</i> the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, and make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>; Woe to the bloody <i>smoke</i>, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not <i>trolled</i> out of it! <i>parker</i> it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it.
    </li>
    <li>For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust;
    </li>
    <li>That it might cause fury to <i>troll</i> up to <i>lell</i> <i>the rights</i>; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>; Woe to the bloody <i>smoke</i>! I will even make the pile for <i>binco fakement</i> <i>dowry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Heap on wood, kindle the <i>binco fakement</i>, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned.
    </li>
    <li>Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the scum of it may be consumed.
    </li>
    <li>She hath wearied herself with lies, and her <i>dowry</i> scum <i>trolled</i> not forth out of her: her scum shall be in the <i>binco fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>In thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, <i>nishta</i> be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to <i>lettie</i> upon thee.
    </li>
    <li>I the <i>Duchess</i> have <i>cackled</i> it: it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, and I will do it; I will not <i>troll</i> back, <i>nishta</i> will I spare, <i>nishta</i> will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they <i>beak</i> thee, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Also the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> unto me, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, <i>varda</i>, I <i>lell</i> away from thee the <i>fancy</i> of thine <i>ogles</i> with a stroke: yet <i>nishta</i> shalt thou mourn <i>nishta</i> <i>parnie</i>, <i>nishta</i> shall thy tears run down.
    </li>
    <li>Forbear to <i>screech</i>, make no mourning for the <i>stiff</i>, bind the tire of thine <i>eke</i> upon thee, and put on thy <i>slingbacks</i> upon thy <i>plates</i>, and cover not thy lips, and <i>jarry</i> not the <i>pannan</i> of <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So I <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>homies and palones</i> in the morning: and at even my <i>palone affair</i> <i>carked it</i>; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, Wilt thou not <i>cackle</i> us what these <i>fakements</i> are to us, that thou doest so?
    </li>
    <li>Then I answered them, The <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> unto me, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackle</i> unto the <i>lattie</i> of Israel, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>; <i>varda</i>, I will <i>billingsgate</i> my sanctuary, the excellency of your <i>butchness</i>, the <i>fancy</i> of your <i>ogles</i>, and that which your <i>nishta lucoddy</i> pitieth; and your <i>homie chavvies</i> and your <i>palone chavvies</i> whom ye have <i>dry</i> shall fall by the <i>dowry efink</i>.

    <li>And ye shall do as I have done: <i>nanti</i> cover your lips, <i>nishta</i> <i>jarry</i> the <i>pannan</i> of <i>homies</i>.

    <li>And your tires shall be upon your <i>ekes</i>, and your <i>slingbacks</i> upon your <i>plates</i>: <i>nanti</i> mourn <i>nishta</i> <i>parnie</i>; but ye shall pine away for your <i>cods</i>, and mourn <i>una</i> toward another.

    <li>Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that <i>she</i> hath done shall ye do: and when this <i>trolleth</i>, ye shall know that I am the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>.

    <li>Also, thou <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, shall it not be in the <i>journo</i> when I <i>lell</i> from them their <i>butchness</i>, the joy of their <i>fabeness</i>, the <i>fancy</i> of their <i>ogles</i>, and that whereupon they set their minds, their <i>homie chavvies</i> and their <i>palone chavvies</i>,

    <li>That <i>she</i> that escapeth in that <i>journo</i> shall <i>troll</i> unto thee, to cause thee to <i>aunt nell</i> it with thine <i>aunt nelly cheats</i>?

    <li><i>Any road up</i> in the eleventh year, in the third month, in the first <i>journo</i> of the month, that the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> unto me, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, <i>cackle</i> unto Pharaoh <i>dowriest homie</i> of Egypt, and to <i>her</i> multitude; Whom art thou like in thy <i>dowriness</i>?
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with <i>filly</i> branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and <i>her</i> top was among the thick boughs.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>aquas</i> made <i>her</i> <i>dowry</i>, the deep set <i>her</i> up on high with her rivers <i>trolling</i> round about <i>her</i> plants, and <i>laued</i> her <i>bijou</i> rivers unto all the trees of the field.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore <i>her</i> height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and <i>her</i> boughs were multiplied, and <i>her</i> branches became long because of the multitude of <i>aquas</i>, when <i>she</i> shot forth.
    </li>
    <li>All the fowls of heaven made their nests in <i>her</i> boughs, and under <i>her</i> branches did all the beasts of the field <i>parker</i> forth their <i>bean</i>, and under <i>her</i> shadow <i>letted</i> all <i>dowry</i> nations.
    </li>
    <li>Thus was <i>she</i> <i>filly</i> in <i>her</i> <i>dowriness</i>, in the length of <i>her</i> branches: for <i>her</i> root was by <i>dowry</i> <i>aquas</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The cedars in the garden of <i>Gloria</i> could not hide <i>her</i>: the fir trees were not like <i>her</i> boughs, and the chestnut trees were not like <i>her</i> branches; <i>nishta</i> any tree in the garden of <i>Gloria</i> was like unto <i>her</i> in <i>her</i> beauty.
    </li>
    <li>I have made <i>her</i> <i>filly</i> by the multitude of <i>her</i> branches: so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of <i>Gloria</i>, envied <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>; Because thou hast lifted up thyself in height, and <i>she</i> hath shot up <i>her</i> top among the thick boughs, and <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> is lifted up in <i>her</i> height;
    </li>
    <li>I have therefore <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> into the <i>famble</i> of the <i>dowry butch</i> <i>una</i> of the heathen; <i>she</i> shall surely deal with <i>her</i>: I have driven <i>her</i> out for <i>her</i> <i>naffness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And strangers, the <i>nanna</i> of the nations, have cut <i>her</i> off, and have <i>dry</i> <i>her</i>: upon the mountains and in all the valleys <i>her</i> branches are fallen, and <i>her</i> boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the <i>homies and palones</i> of the earth are <i>trolled</i> down from <i>her</i> shadow, and have <i>dry</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Upon <i>her</i> ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon <i>her</i> branches:
    </li>
    <li>To the end that none of all the trees by the <i>aquas</i> exalt themselves for their height, <i>nishta</i> shoot up their top among the thick boughs, <i>nishta</i> their trees stand up in their height, all that <i>buvare</i> <i>aqua</i>: for they are all <i>laued</i> unto <i>carking it</i>, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the <i>chavvies</i> of <i>homies</i>, with them that <i>troll</i> down to the pit.
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>; In the <i>journo</i> when <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> down to the grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for <i>her</i>, and I restrained the <i>dowry aquas</i> thereof, and the <i>dowry</i> <i>aquas</i> were stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for <i>her</i>, and all the trees of the field fainted for <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I made the nations to shake at the sound of <i>her</i> fall, when I cast <i>her</i> down to hell with them that <i>troll down</i> into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that <i>buvare</i> <i>aqua</i>, shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth.
    </li>
    <li>They also <i>trolled</i> down into hell with <i>her</i> unto them that be <i>ferricadoozed</i> with the <i>dowry efink</i>; and they that were <i>her</i> arm, that <i>letted</i> under <i>her</i> shadow in the midst of the heathen.
    </li>
    <li>To whom art thou thus like in <i>fabeness</i> and in <i>dowriness</i> among the trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the <i>cavalier</i> with them that be <i>ferricadoozed</i> by the <i>dowry efink</i>.

    <li>As a shepherd <i>charpereth</i> out <i>her</i> flock in the <i>journo</i> that <i>she</i> is among <i>her</i> sheep that are scattered; so will I <i>charper</i> out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark <i>journo</i>.

    <li>And I will <i>parker</i> them out from the <i>homies and palones</i>, and gather them from the countries, and will <i>parker</i> them to their own land, and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of the country.

    <li>I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>.

    <li>And I the <i>Duchess</i> will be their <i>Gloria</i>, and my <i>serving homie</i> <i>Davina</i> a <i>princess</i> among them; I the <i>Duchess</i> have <i>cackled</i> it.

    <li>And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the <i>nana</i> beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall <i>lett</i> safely in the <i>nishta smoke</i>, and <i>letty</i> in the woods.

    <li>And I will make them and the places round about my hill a <i>bona lav</i>; and I will cause the shower to <i>troll</i> down in <i>her</i> season; there shall be showers of <i>bona lav</i>.

    <li>And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I am the <i>Duchess</i>, when I have broken the bands of their yoke, and <i>laued</i> them out of the <i>famble</i> of those that served themselves of them.

    <h2>Chapter 40</h2>

    <li>In the <i>chinker</i> and <i>dewey dachath</i> year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the <i>dachath</i> <i>journo</i> of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the <i>smoke</i> was smitten, in the selfsame <i>journo</i> the <i>famble</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> was upon me, and brought me thither.
    </li>
    <li>In the visions of <i>Gloria</i> brought <i>she</i> me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a <i>dowry</i> high mountain, by which was as the frame of a <i>smoke</i> on the south.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> brought me thither, and, <i>varda</i>, there was a <i>homie</i>, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>, and a measuring reed; and <i>she</i> stood in the gate.

    <li>And the <i>homie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, <i>varda</i> with thine <i>ogles</i>, and <i>aunt nell</i> with thine <i>aunt nelly cheats</i>, and set thine <i>thumping cheat</i> upon all that I shall shew thee; for to the intent that I might shew them unto thee art thou brought hither: <i>screech</i> all that thou <i>vardest</i> to the <i>lattie</i> of Israel.

    <li>And <i>varda</i> a wall on the outside of the <i>lattie</i> round about, and in the <i>homie</i>&#8216;s <i>famble</i> a measuring reed of <i>sey</i> cubits long by the cubit and an <i>famble</i> breadth: so <i>she</i> measured the breadth of the building, <i>una</i> reed; and the height, <i>una</i> reed.

    <li><i>She</i> measured also the porch of the gate within, <i>una</i> reed.

    <li>Then measured <i>she</i> the porch of the gate, <i>say dooe</i> cubits; and the posts thereof, <i>dewey</i> cubits; and the porch of the gate was inward.

    <li>And the <i>bijou</i> chambers of the gate eastward were <i>trey</i> on this side, and <i>trey</i> on that side; they <i>trey</i> were of <i>una</i> measure: and the posts had <i>una</i> measure on this side and on that side.

    <li>The space also before the <i>bijou</i> chambers was <i>una</i> cubit on this side, and the space was <i>una</i> cubit on that side: and the <i>bijou</i> chambers were <i>sey</i> cubits on this side, and <i>sey</i> cubits on that side.

    <li><i>She</i> measured then the gate from the roof of <i>una</i> <i>bijou</i> <i>booth</i> to the roof of another: the breadth was <i>chinker</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i> cubits, door against door.

    <li><i>She</i> made also posts of <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> cubits, even unto the post of the court round about the gate.
    </li>
    <li>And from the <i>eke</i> of the gate of the entrance unto the <i>eke</i> of the porch of the inner gate were <i>chinker dacha</i> cubits.

    <li>Then brought <i>she</i> me into the outward court, and, lo, there were chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: <i>trey dacha</i> chambers were upon the pavement.

    <li>And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates was the lower pavement.

    <li>And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north, <i>she</i> measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof.

    <li>And the gate of the inner court was over against the gate toward the north, and toward the east; and <i>she</i> measured from gate to gate an <i>chenter</i> cubits.

    <li>After that <i>she</i> brought me toward the south, and <i>varda</i> a gate toward the south: and <i>she</i> measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures.

    <li>And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length was <i>chinker dacha</i> cubits, and the breadth <i>chinker</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i> cubits.

    <li>And there was a gate in the inner court toward the south: and <i>she</i> measured from gate to gate toward the south an <i>chenter</i> cubits.

    <li>And in the porch of the gate were <i>dewey</i> tables on this side, and <i>dewey</i> tables on that side, to <i>ferricadooza</i> thereon the burnt <i>parkering</i> and the <i>kertever</i> <i>parkering</i> and the <i>caterver</i> <i>parkering</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And at the side <i>nanti</i>, as <i>una</i> goeth up to the entry of the north gate, were <i>dewey</i> tables; and on the other side, which was at the porch of the gate, were <i>dewey</i> tables.

    <li><i>Quarter</i> tables were on this side, and <i>quarter</i> tables on that side, by the side of the gate; <i>say dooe</i> tables, whereupon they <i>ferricadoozaed</i> their <i>parkers</i>.

    <li>And the <i>quarter</i> tables were of hewn stone for the burnt <i>parkering</i>, of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and <i>una</i> cubit high: whereupon also they <i>laued</i> the instruments wherewith they <i>ferricadoozaed</i> the burnt <i>parkering</i> and the <i>parker</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And within were hooks, an <i>famble</i> broad, fastened round about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the <i>parkering</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>nanti</i> the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south: <i>una</i> at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, This <i>booth</i>, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the <i>godly homies</i>, the keepers of the charge of the <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>booth</i> whose prospect is toward the north is for the <i>godly homies</i>, the keepers of the charge of the <i>grovelling fakement</i>: these are the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Zadok among the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Levi, which <i>troll</i> near to the <i>Duchess</i> to minister unto <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So <i>she</i> measured the court, an <i>chenter</i> cubits long, and an <i>chenter</i> cubits broad, foursquare; and the <i>grovelling fakement</i> that was before the <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> brought me to the porch of the <i>lattie</i>, and measured each post of the porch, <i>chinker</i> cubits on this side, and <i>chinker</i> cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was <i>trey</i> cubits on this side, and <i>trey</i> cubits on that side.
    </li>
    <li>The length of the porch was <i>dewey dacha</i> cubits, and the breadth <i>long dedger</i> cubits, and <i>she</i> brought me by the steps whereby they <i>trolled</i> up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, <i>una</i> on this side, and another on that side.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 41</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Afterward <i>she</i> brought me to the <i>holy carsey</i>, and measured the posts, <i>sey</i> cubits broad on the <i>una</i> side, and <i>sey</i> cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the <i>bijou tabernaclette</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the breadth of the door was <i>dacha</i> cubits; and the sides of the door were <i>chinker</i> cubits on the <i>una</i> side, and <i>chinker</i> cubits on the other side: and <i>she</i> measured the length thereof, <i>quarter dacha</i> cubits: and the breadth, <i>dewey dacha</i> cubits.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>trolled</i> <i>she</i> inward, and measured the post of the door, <i>dewey</i> cubits; and the door, <i>sey</i> cubits; and the breadth of the door, <i>setter</i> cubits.
    </li>
    <li>So <i>she</i> measured the length thereof, <i>dewey dacha</i> cubits; and the breadth, <i>dewey dacha</i> cubits, before the <i>holy carsey</i>: and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, This is the most <i>fabulosa</i> place.
    </li>
    <li>After <i>she</i> measured the wall of the <i>lattie</i>, <i>sey</i> cubits; and the breadth of every side <i>booth</i>, <i>quarter</i> cubits, round about the <i>lattie</i> on every side.
    </li>
    <li>And the side chambers were <i>trey</i>, <i>una</i> over another, and <i>trey dacha</i> in order; and they entered into the wall which was of the <i>lattie</i> for the side chambers round about, that they might have hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the side chambers: for the winding about of the <i>lattie</i> <i>trolled</i> still upward round about the <i>lattie</i>: therefore the breadth of the <i>lattie</i> was still upward, and so increased from the lowest <i>booth</i> to the highest by the midst.
    </li>
    <li>I <i>vardad</i> also the height of the <i>lattie</i> round about: the foundations of the side chambers were a full reed of <i>sey</i> <i>dowry</i> cubits.
    </li>
    <li>The thickness of the wall, which was for the side <i>booth</i> <i>nanti</i>, was <i>chinker</i> cubits: and that which was <i>dry</i> was the place of the side chambers that were within.
    </li>
    <li>And between the chambers was the wideness of <i>dewey dacha</i> cubits round about the <i>lattie</i> on every side.
    </li>
    <li>And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was <i>dry</i>, <i>una</i> door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was <i>dry</i> was <i>chinker</i> cubits round about.
    </li>
    <li>Now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was <i>setter dacha</i> cubits broad; and the wall of the building was <i>chinker</i> cubits thick round about, and the length thereof <i>nobber dacha</i> cubits.
    </li>
    <li>So <i>she</i> measured the <i>lattie</i>, an <i>chenter</i> cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an <i>chenter</i> cubits long;
    </li>
    <li>Also the breadth of the <i>eke</i> of the <i>lattie</i>, and of the separate place toward the east, an <i>chenter</i> cubits.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> measured the length of the building over against the separate place which was behind it, and the galleries thereof on the <i>una</i> side and on the other side, an <i>chenter</i> cubits, with the inner <i>holy carsey</i>, and the porches of the court;
    </li>
    <li>The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on their <i>trey</i> stories, over against the door, cieled with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows were covered;
    </li>
    <li>To that above the door, even unto the inner <i>lattie</i>, and <i>nanti</i>, and by all the wall round about within and <i>nanti</i>, by measure.
    </li>
    <li>And it was made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had <i>dewey</i> <i>ekes</i>;
    </li>
    <li>So that the <i>eke</i> of a <i>homie</i> was toward the palm tree on the <i>una</i> side, and the <i>eke</i> of a <i>bean</i> lion toward the palm tree on the other side: it was made through all the <i>lattie</i> round about.
    </li>
    <li>From the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm trees made, and on the wall of the <i>holy carsey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The posts of the <i>holy carsey</i> were squared, and the <i>eke</i> of the sanctuary; the appearance of the <i>una</i> as the appearance of the other.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>grovelling fakement</i> of wood was <i>trey</i> cubits high, and the length thereof <i>dewey</i> cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, This is the table that is before the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>holy carsey</i> and the sanctuary had <i>dewey</i> doors.

    <li>And there were made on them, on the doors of the <i>holy carsey</i>, cherubims and palm trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there were thick planks upon the <i>eke</i> of the porch <i>nanti</i>.

    <li>Then <i>she</i> brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the north: and <i>she</i> brought me into the <i>booth</i> that was over against the separate place, and which was before the building toward the north.

    <li>Before the length of an <i>chenter</i> cubits was the north door, and the breadth was <i>chinker dacha</i> cubits.

    <li>Over against the <i>dewey dacha</i> cubits which were for the inner court, and over against the pavement which was for the utter court, was gallery against gallery in <i>trey</i> stories.

    <li>And before the chambers was a <i>mince</i> to <i>dacha</i> cubits breadth inward, a way of <i>una</i> cubit; and their doors toward the north.
    </li>
    <li>Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building.
    </li>
    <li>For they were in <i>trey</i> stories, but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore the building was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.
    </li>
    <li>And the wall that was <i>nanti</i> over against the chambers, toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof was <i>chinker dacha</i> cubits.

    <li>For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was <i>chinker dacha</i> cubits: and, lo, before the <i>holy carsey</i> were an <i>chenter</i> cubits.

    <li>And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as <i>una</i> goeth into them from the utter court.

    <li>The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building.

    <li>And the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers which were toward the north, as long as they, and as broad as they: and all their goings out were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.

    <li>And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door in the <i>eke</i> of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as <i>una</i> entereth into them.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i> unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they be <i>fabulosa</i> chambers, where the <i>godly homies</i> that approach unto the <i>Duchess</i> shall <i>jarry</i> the most <i>fabulosa</i> <i>fakements</i>: there shall they <i>lett</i> the most <i>fabulosa</i> <i>fakements</i>, and the <i>carnish</i> <i>parkering</i>, and the <i>kertever</i> <i>parkering</i>, and the <i>caterver</i> <i>parkering</i>; for the place is <i>fabulosa</i>.

    <li>When the <i>godly homies</i> enter therein, then shall they not <i>troll out</i> of the <i>fabulosa</i> place into the utter court, but there they shall <i>lett</i> their <i>frocks</i> wherein they minister; for they are <i>fabulosa</i>; and shall put on other <i>frocks</i>, and shall approach to those <i>fakements</i> which are for the <i>homies and palones</i>.

    <li>Now when <i>she</i> had made an end of measuring the inner <i>lattie</i>, <i>she</i> brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about.

    <li><i>She</i> measured the east side with the measuring reed, <i>chinker</i> <i>chenter</i> reeds, with the measuring reed round about.

    <li><i>She</i> measured the north side, <i>chinker</i> <i>chenter</i> reeds, with the measuring reed round about.

    <li><i>She</i> turned about to the west side, and measured <i>chinker</i> <i>chenter</i> reeds with the measuring reed.

    <li><i>She</i> measured it by the <i>quarter</i> sides: it had a wall round about, <i>chinker</i> <i>chenter</i> reeds long, and <i>chinker</i> <i>chenter</i> broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the <i>billingsgate</i> place.

    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>; The gate of the inner court that <i>varda-eth</i> toward the east shall be shut the <i>sey</i> working days; but on the sabbath it shall be opened, and in the <i>journo</i> of the new moon it shall be opened.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>princess</i> shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate <i>nanti</i>, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the <i>godly homies</i> shall prepare <i>her</i> burnt <i>parkering</i> and <i>her</i> peace <i>parkerings</i>, and <i>she</i> shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then <i>she</i> shall <i>troll forth</i>; but the gate shall not be shut until the <i>bijou nochy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Likewise the <i>homies and palones</i> of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the <i>Duchess</i> in the sabbaths and in the new moons.
    </li>
    <li>And the burnt <i>parkering</i> that the <i>princess</i> shall offer unto the <i>Duchess</i> in the sabbath <i>journo</i> shall be <i>sey</i> lambs <i>nanti</i> blemish, and a ram <i>nanti</i> blemish.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>carnish</i> <i>parkering</i> shall be an ephah for a ram, and the <i>carnish</i> <i>parkering</i> for the lambs as <i>she</i> shall be able to <i>parker</i>, and an hin of <i>lube</i> to an ephah.
    </li>
    <li>And in the <i>journo</i> of the new moon it shall be a <i>bean</i> bullock <i>nanti</i> blemish, and <i>sey</i> lambs, and a ram: they shall be <i>nanti</i> blemish.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> shall prepare a <i>carnish</i> <i>parkering</i>, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according as <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> shall attain unto, and an hin of <i>lube</i> to an ephah.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>princess</i> shall enter, <i>she</i> shall <i>troll</i> in by the way of the porch of that gate, and <i>she</i> shall <i>troll forth</i> by the way thereof.
    </li>
    <li>But when the <i>homies and palones</i> of the land shall <i>troll</i> before the <i>Duchess</i> in the solemn <i>dowry munjarlees</i>, <i>she</i> that entereth in by the way of the north gate to worship shall <i>troll out</i> by the way of the south gate; and <i>she</i> that entereth by the way of the south gate shall <i>troll forth</i> by the way of the north gate: <i>she</i> shall not return by the way of the gate whereby <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> in, but shall <i>troll forth</i> over against it.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>princess</i> in the midst of them, when they <i>troll</i> in, shall <i>troll</i> in; and when they <i>troll forth</i>, shall <i>troll forth</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And in the <i>dowry munjarlees</i> and in the solemnities the <i>carnish</i> <i>parkering</i> shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as <i>she</i> is able to <i>parker</i>, and an hin of <i>lube</i> to an ephah.
    </li>
    <li>Now when the <i>princess</i> shall prepare a voluntary burnt <i>parkering</i> or peace <i>parkerings</i> voluntarily unto the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>una</i> shall then open <i>her</i> the gate that <i>varda-eth</i> toward the east, and <i>she</i> shall prepare <i>her</i> burnt <i>parkering</i> and <i>her</i> peace <i>parkerings</i>, as <i>she</i> did on the sabbath <i>journo</i>: then <i>she</i> shall <i>troll forth</i>; and after <i>her</i> going forth <i>una</i> shall shut the gate.
    </li>
    <li>Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt <i>parkering</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i> of a lamb of the first year <i>nanti</i> blemish: thou shalt prepare it every morning.
    </li>
    <li>And thou shalt prepare a <i>carnish</i> <i>parkering</i> for it every morning, the <i>seyth</i> part of an ephah, and the third part of an hin of <i>lube</i>, to temper with the <i>bona</i> flour; a <i>carnish</i> <i>parkering</i> continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the <i>carnish</i> <i>parkering</i>, and the <i>lube</i>, every morning for a continual burnt <i>parkering</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>; If the <i>princess</i> <i>parker</i> a gift unto any of <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>, the inheritance thereof shall be <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>&#8216;; it shall be their <i>fakement</i> by inheritance.
    </li>
    <li>But if <i>she</i> <i>parker</i> a gift of <i>her</i> inheritance to <i>una</i> of <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>, then it shall be <i>her</i> to the year of liberty; after it shall <i>troll back to</i> the <i>princess</i>: but <i>her</i> inheritance shall be <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>&#8216; for them.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover the <i>princess</i> shall not <i>lell</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i>&#8216;s inheritance by oppression, to thrust them out of their <i>fakement</i>; but <i>she</i> shall <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> inheritance out of <i>her</i> own <i>fakement</i>: that my <i>homies and palones</i> be not scattered every <i>homie</i> from <i>her</i> <i>fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>After <i>she</i> brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the <i>fabulosa</i> chambers of the <i>godly homies</i>, which looked toward the north: and, <i>varda</i>, there was a place on the <i>dewey</i> sides westward.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i> unto me, This is the place where the <i>godly homies</i> shall boil the <i>caterver</i> <i>parkering</i> and the <i>kertever</i> <i>parkering</i>, where they shall bake the <i>carnish</i> <i>parkering</i>; that they bear them not out into the utter court, to <i>bonafy</i> the <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>she</i> brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me to <i>troll by</i> the <i>quarter</i> corners of the court; and, <i>varda</i>, in every corner of the court there was a court.
    </li>
    <li>In the <i>quarter</i> corners of the court there were courts joined of <i>quarter dacha</i> cubits long and <i>trey dacha</i> broad: these <i>quarter</i> corners were of <i>una</i> measure.
    </li>
    <li>And there was a row of building round about in them, round about them <i>quarter</i>, and it was made with boiling places under the rows round about.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i> unto me, These are the places of them that boil, where the ministers of the <i>lattie</i> shall boil the <i>parker</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 47</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Afterward <i>she</i> brought me again unto the door of the <i>lattie</i>; and, <i>varda</i>, <i>aquas</i> issued out from under the threshold of the <i>lattie</i> eastward: for the forefront of the <i>lattie</i> stood toward the east, and the <i>aquas</i> <i>trolled</i> down from under from the <i>sweet</i> side of the <i>lattie</i>, at the south side of the <i>grovelling fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then brought <i>she</i> me out of the way of the gate northward, and led me about the way <i>nanti</i> unto the utter gate by the way that <i>varda-eth</i> eastward; and, <i>varda</i>, there ran out <i>aquas</i> on the <i>sweet</i> side.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>homie</i> that had the line in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> <i>trolled</i> forth eastward, <i>she</i> measured a <i>mille</i> cubits, and <i>she</i> brought me through the <i>aquas</i>; the <i>aquas</i> were to the ankles.
    </li>
    <li>Again <i>she</i> measured a <i>mille</i>, and brought me through the <i>aquas</i>; the <i>aquas</i> were to the knees. Again <i>she</i> measured a <i>mille</i>, and brought me through; the <i>aquas</i> were to the loins.
    </li>
    <li>Afterward <i>she</i> measured a <i>mille</i>; and it was a river that I could not <i>troll over</i>: for the <i>aquas</i> were risen, <i>aquas</i> to swim in, a river that could not be passed over.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, hast thou <i>vardad</i> this? Then <i>she</i> brought me, and caused me to <i>troll back to</i> the brink of the river.
    </li>
    <li>Now when I had <i>trolled back</i>, <i>varda</i>, at the bank of the river were <i>dowry</i> many trees on the <i>una</i> side and on the other.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i> unto me, These <i>aquas</i> issue out toward the east country, and <i>troll</i> down into the desert, and <i>troll</i> into the sea: which being brought forth into the sea, the <i>aquas</i> shall be healed.
    </li>
    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, that every <i>fakement</i> that <i>letteth</i>, which <i>trolleth</i>, whithersoever the rivers shall <i>troll</i>, shall live: and there shall be a <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry</i> multitude of fish, because these <i>aquas</i> shall <i>troll</i> thither: for they shall be healed; and every <i>fakement</i> shall live whither the river <i>trolleth</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, that the fishers shall stand upon it from Engedi even unto Eneglaim; they shall be a place to spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the <i>dowry</i> sea, exceeding many.
    </li>
    <li>But the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not be healed; they shall be <i>parkered</i> to salt.
    </li>
    <li>And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for <i>carnish</i>, whose leaf shall not fade, <i>nishta</i> shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall <i>parker</i> forth new fruit according to <i>her</i> months, because their <i>aquas</i> they issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for <i>carnish</i>, and the leaf thereof for medicine.
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>; This shall be the border, whereby ye shall inherit the land according to the <i>kenza</i> tribes of Israel: <i>Josephine</i> shall have <i>dewey</i> portions.
    </li>
    <li>And ye shall inherit it, <i>una</i> as well as another: concerning the which I lifted up mine <i>famble</i> to <i>parker</i> it unto your <i>aunties</i>: and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance.
    </li>
    <li>And this shall be the border of the land toward the north side, from the <i>dowry</i> sea, the way of Hethlon, as <i>homies</i> <i>troll</i> to Zedad;
    </li>
    <li>Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazarhatticon, which is by the coast of Hauran.
    </li>
    <li>And the border from the sea shall be Hazarenan, the border of Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of Hamath. And this is the north side.
    </li>
    <li>And the east side ye shall measure from Hauran, and from Damascus, and from Gilead, and from the land of Israel by Jordan, from the border unto the east sea. And this is the east side.
    </li>
    <li>And the south side southward, from Tamar even to the <i>aquas</i> of strife in Kadesh, the river to the <i>dowry</i> sea. And this is the south side southward.
    </li>
    <li>The west side also shall be the <i>dowry</i> sea from the border, till a <i>homie</i> <i>troll</i> over against Hamath. This is the west side.
    </li>
    <li>So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you, which shall beget <i>chavvies</i> among you: and they shall be unto you as born in the country among the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, that in what tribe the stranger <i>trolleth</i>, there shall ye <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> <i>her</i> inheritance, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>.
