    <h1>Obadiah</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>The vision of Obadiah. Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> concerning Edom; We have <i>aunt nelled</i> a <i>gossip</i> from the <i>Duchess</i>, and an ambassador is <i>laued</i> among the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, I have made thee <i>pogey</i> among the heathen: thou art greatly despised.
    </li>
    <li>The pride of thine <i>thumping cheat</i> hath <i>mogued</i> thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that <i>cackleth</i> in <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>, Who shall <i>parker</i> me down to the ground?
    </li>
    <li>Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the <i>twinkling fakements</i>, thence will I <i>parker</i> thee down, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>If <i>sharpering homies</i> <i>trolled</i> to thee, if robbers by <i>nochy</i>, (how art thou cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grapegatherers <i>trolled</i> to thee, would they not leave some grapes?
    </li>
    <li>How are the <i>fakements</i> of Esau searched out! how are <i>her</i> hidden <i>fakements</i> sought up!
    </li>
    <li>All the <i>homies</i> of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the border: the <i>homies</i> that were at peace with thee have <i>mogued</i> thee, and prevailed against thee; that they <i>jarry</i> thy <i>pannan</i> have <i>laued</i> a wound under thee: there is none understanding in <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Shall I not in that <i>journo</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, even <i>battyfang</i> the wise <i>homies</i> out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?
    </li>
    <li>And thy <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i>, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every <i>una</i> of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter.
    </li>
    <li>For thy <i>slapping</i> against thy <i>sister</i> Jacob <i>scharda</i> shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.
    </li>
    <li>In the <i>journo</i> that thou stoodest on the other side, in the <i>journo</i> that the strangers <i>lelled</i> away captive <i>her</i> forces, and foreigners entered into <i>her</i> gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as <i>una</i> of them.
    </li>
    <li>But thou shouldest not have looked on the <i>journo</i> of thy <i>sister</i> in the <i>journo</i> that <i>she</i> became a stranger; <i>nishta</i> shouldest thou have rejoiced over the <i>chavvies</i> of Judah in the <i>journo</i> of their destruction; <i>nishta</i> shouldest thou have <i>cackled</i> proudly in the <i>journo</i> of distress.
    </li>
    <li>Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my <i>homies and palones</i> in the <i>journo</i> of their calamity; <i>any road up</i>, thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the <i>journo</i> of their calamity, <i>nishta</i> have <i>laued</i> <i>fambles</i> on their substance in the <i>journo</i> of their calamity;
    </li>
    <li><i>Nishta</i> shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut off those of <i>her</i> that did escape; <i>nishta</i> shouldest thou have <i>laued</i> up those of <i>her</i> that did remain in the <i>journo</i> of distress.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>journo</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> is near upon all the heathen: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy <i>parkering</i> shall return upon thine own <i>eke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For as ye have <i>bevvied</i> upon my <i>fabulosa</i> mountain, so shall all the heathen <i>buvare</i> continually, <i>any road up</i>, they shall <i>buvare</i>, and they shall <i>jarry</i> down, and they shall be as though they had not been.
    </li>
    <li>But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness; and the <i>lattie</i> of Jacob shall possess their possessions.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>lattie</i> of Jacob shall be a <i>binco fakement</i>, and the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Josephine</i> a flame, and the <i>lattie</i> of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of the <i>lattie</i> of Esau; for the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>cackled</i> it.
    </li>
    <li>And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and they of the plain the <i>naffs</i>: and they shall possess the fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin shall possess Gilead.
    </li>
    <li>And the captivity of this host of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel shall possess that of the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath; and the captivity of Jerusalem, which is in Sepharad, shall possess the <i>smokes</i> of the south.
    </li>
    <li>And saviours shall <i>troll</i> up on mount Zion to <i>beak</i> the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s.
    </li>
