    <h1>2 Peter</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Simone</i> <i>Petra</i>, a <i>serving homie</i> and an apostle of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the <i>bonaness</i> of <i>Gloria</i> and our Saviour <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>:
    </li>
    <li><i>Gracie</i> and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of <i>Gloria</i>, and of <i>Josie</i> our <i>Duchess</i>,
    </li>
    <li>According as <i>her</i> divine power hath <i>parkered</i> unto us all <i>fakements</i> that pertain unto life and <i>fabeness</i>, through the knowledge of <i>her</i> that hath <i>screeched</i> us to <i>fabeness</i> and virtue:
    </li>
    <li>Whereby are <i>parkered</i> unto us exceeding <i>dowry</i> and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having <i>scarpered</i> the corruption that is in the world through lust.
    </li>
    <li>And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;
    </li>
    <li>And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience <i>fabeness</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And to <i>fabeness</i> brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.
    </li>
    <li>For if these <i>fakements</i> be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall <i>nishta</i> be barren <i>nishta</i> unfruitful in the knowledge of our <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> that lacketh these <i>fakements</i> is <i>nanti varda</i>, and cannot <i>varda</i> <i>nishta ajax</i> off, and hath forgotten that <i>she</i> was purged from <i>her</i> <i>badge</i> <i>kertervers</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore the rather, <i>sisters</i>, <i>parker</i> diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these <i>fakements</i>, ye shall never fall:
    </li>
    <li>For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you <i>dowrily</i> into the everlasting kingdom of our <i>Duchess</i> and Saviour <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these <i>fakements</i>, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, I think it meet, as long as I am in this <i>bijou tabernaclette</i>, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;
    </li>
    <li>Knowing that shortly I must put off this my <i>bijou tabernaclette</i>, even as our <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> hath shewed me.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these <i>fakements</i> always in remembrance.
    </li>
    <li>For we have not <i>trolled after</i> cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and <i>trolling</i> of our <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, but were eyewitnesses of <i>her</i> <i>fabularity</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> <i>lalled</i> from <i>Gloria</i> the <i>Auntie</i> honour and <i>fabeness</i>, when there <i>trolled</i> such a <i>cackling fakement</i> to <i>her</i> from the <i>fantabulosa</i> <i>fabeness</i>, This is my beloved <i>homie chavvie</i>, in whom I am well pleased.
    </li>
    <li>And this <i>cackling fakement</i> which <i>trolled</i> from heaven we <i>aunt nelled</i>, when we were with <i>her</i> in the <i>fabulosa</i> mount.
    </li>
    <li>We have also a more sure <i>lav</i> of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye <i>lell</i> heed, as unto a <i>sparkle</i> that shineth in a dark place, until the <i>journo</i> dawn, and the <i>journo</i> <i>twinkling fakement</i> arise in your <i>thumping cheats</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the <i>glossy</i> is of any private interpretation.
    </li>
    <li>For the prophecy <i>trolled</i> not in <i>badge</i> time by the will of <i>homie</i>: but <i>fabulosa</i> <i>homies</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i> as they were <i>trolled</i> by the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>But there were false prophets also among the <i>homies and palones</i>, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall <i>parker</i> in damnable heresies, even denying the <i>Duchess</i> that bought them, and <i>parker</i> upon themselves swift destruction.
    </li>
    <li>And many shall <i>troll after</i> their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be <i>nana</i> <i>cackled</i> of.
    </li>
    <li>And through <i>ogling</i> shall they with feigned <i>lavs</i> make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.
    </li>
    <li>For if <i>Gloria</i> spared not the <i>fairies</i> that <i>kertervered</i>, but cast them down to hell, and <i>laued</i> them into chains of <i>munge</i>, to be reserved unto judgment;
    </li>
    <li>And spared not the <i>badge</i> world, but saved <i>Norah</i> the <i>otterth</i> person, a <i>cackling homie</i> of <i>bonaness</i>, bringing in the <i>dowry aqua</i> upon the world of the ungodly;
    </li>
    <li>And turning the <i>smokes</i> of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;
    </li>
    <li>And <i>laued</i> just Lot, vexed with the <i>manky</i> conversation of the <i>naff</i>:
    </li>
    <li>(For that <i>bona</i> <i>homie</i> dwelling among them, in <i>vardaing</i> and hearing, vexed <i>her</i> <i>bona</i> <i>nishta lucoddy</i> from <i>journo</i> to <i>journo</i> with their unlawful deeds;)
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> knoweth how to deliver the <i>fabe</i> out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the <i>journo</i> of judgment to be <i>zsa zsa-ed</i>:
    </li>
    <li>But chiefly them that <i>mince</i> after the flesh in the lust of <i>nishta sparkle</i>, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid to <i>cackle</i> <i>nana</i> of dignities.
    </li>
    <li>Whereas <i>fairies</i>, which are <i>dowrier</i> in power and might, <i>parker</i> not railing accusation against them before the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be <i>lelled</i> and <i>battyfanged</i>, <i>cackle</i> <i>nana</i> of the <i>fakements</i> that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;
    </li>
    <li>And shall <i>lall</i> the <i>parkering</i> of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the <i>journo</i> time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they <i>dowry munjarlee</i> with you;
    </li>
    <li>Having <i>ogles</i> full of adultery, and that cannot cease from <i>kertever</i>; beguiling unstable <i>nishta lucoddies</i>: an <i>thumping cheat</i> they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed <i>chavvies</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Which have forsaken the <i>sweet</i> way, and are <i>trolled</i> astray, following the way of Balaam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Bosor, who loved the <i>parkering ninty</i> of unrighteousness;
    </li>
    <li>But was rebuked for <i>her</i> <i>codness</i>: the <i>nanti polari</i> ass speaking with <i>homie</i>&#8216;s <i>cackling fakement</i> forbad the <i>meshigener</i> of the prophet.
    </li>
    <li>These are wells <i>nanti</i> <i>aqua</i>, clouds that are <i>lelled</i> with a tempest; to whom the mist of <i>munge</i> is reserved for ever.
    </li>
    <li>For when they <i>cackle</i> <i>dowry</i> swelling <i>lavs</i> of <i>spangly</i>, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through <i>dowry</i> wantonness, those that were clean <i>scarpered</i> from them who live in error.
    </li>
    <li>While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the <i>serving homies</i> of corruption: for of whom a <i>homie</i> is overcome, of the same is <i>she</i> brought in bondage.
    </li>
    <li>For if after they have <i>scarpered</i> the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the <i>Duchess</i> and Saviour <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.
    </li>
    <li>For it had been <i>benar</i> for them not to have known the way of <i>bonaness</i>, than, after they have known it, to turn from the <i>fabulosa</i> <i>butch lav</i> <i>laued</i> unto them.
    </li>
    <li>But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The <i>girl with a lovely personality</i> is turned to <i>her</i> own vomit again; and the sow that was <i>dhobied</i> to her wallowing in the mire.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>This second epistle, beloved, I now <i>screeve</i> unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:
    </li>
    <li>That ye may be mindful of the <i>lavs</i> which were <i>cackled</i> before by the <i>fabulosa</i> prophets, and of the <i>butch lav</i> of us the apostles of the <i>Duchess</i> and Saviour:
    </li>
    <li>Knowing this first, that there shall <i>troll</i> in the last days scoffers, <i>mincing</i> after their own lusts,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackling</i>, Where is the promise of <i>her</i> <i>trolling</i>? for since the <i>aunties</i> fell asleep, all <i>fakements</i> continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.
    </li>
    <li>For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i> the heavens were of <i>badge</i>, and the earth standing out of the <i>aqua</i> and in the <i>aqua</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with <i>aqua</i>, perished:
    </li>
    <li>But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same <i>lav</i> are kept in store, reserved unto <i>binco fakement</i> against the <i>journo</i> of judgment and perdition of ungodly <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But, beloved, be not ignorant of this <i>una</i> <i>fakement</i>, that <i>una</i> <i>journo</i> is with the <i>Duchess</i> as a <i>mille</i> years, and a <i>mille</i> years as <i>una</i> <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> is not slack concerning <i>her</i> promise, as some <i>homies</i> count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should <i>troll</i> to repentance.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>journo</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> will <i>troll</i> as a <i>sharpering homie</i> in the <i>nochy</i>; in the which the heavens shall <i>troll away</i> with a <i>dowry</i> <i>screech</i>, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.
    </li>
    <li><i>Vardaing</i> then that all these <i>fakements</i> shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all <i>fabulosa</i> conversation and <i>fabeness</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Looking for and hasting unto the <i>trolling</i> of the <i>journo</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, wherein the heavens being on <i>binco fakement</i> shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> we, according to <i>her</i> promise, <i>varda</i> for new heavens and a new earth, wherein <i>letteth</i> <i>bonaness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore, beloved, <i>vardaing</i> that ye <i>varda</i> for such <i>fakements</i>, be diligent that ye may be found of <i>her</i> in peace, <i>nanti</i> spot, and blameless.
    </li>
    <li>And account that the longsuffering of our <i>Duchess</i> is salvation; even as our beloved <i>sister</i> <i>Pauline</i> also according to the wisdom <i>parkered</i> unto <i>her</i> hath <i>screeved</i> unto you;
    </li>
    <li>As also in all <i>her</i> epistles, speaking in them of these <i>fakements</i>; in which are some <i>fakements</i> hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other <i>glossies</i>, unto their own destruction.
    </li>
    <li>Ye therefore, beloved, <i>vardaing</i> ye know these <i>fakements</i> before, <i>gardy loo</i> lest ye also, being led away with the error of the <i>naff</i>, fall from your own stedfastness.
    </li>
    <li>But grow in <i>gracie</i>, and in the knowledge of our <i>Duchess</i> and Saviour <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>. To <i>her</i> be <i>fabeness</i> both now and for ever. <i>Larlou</i>.
