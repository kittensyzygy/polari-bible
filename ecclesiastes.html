    <h1>Ecclesiastes</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>The <i>lavs</i> of the <i>cackling homie</i>, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>Davina</i>, <i>dowriest homie</i> in Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li><i>Spangly</i> of <i>spanglies</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>cackling homie</i>, <i>spangly</i> of <i>spanglies</i>; all is <i>spangly</i>.
    </li>
    <li>What profit hath a <i>homie</i> of all <i>her</i> <i>acting dickey</i> which <i>she</i> <i>lelleth</i> under the sun?
    </li>
    <li><i>Una</i> generation passeth away, and another generation <i>trolleth</i>: but the earth <i>letteth</i> for ever.
    </li>
    <li>The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to <i>her</i> place where <i>she</i> arose.
    </li>
    <li>The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind <i>trolleth back</i> again according to <i>her</i> circuits.
    </li>
    <li>All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers <i>troll</i>, thither they return again.
    </li>
    <li>All <i>fakements</i> are full of <i>acting dickey</i>; <i>homie</i> cannot utter it: the <i>ogle</i> is not satisfied with <i>vardaing</i>, <i>nishta</i> the <i>aunt nelling cheat</i> filled with hearing.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>fakement</i> that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new <i>fakement</i> under the sun.
    </li>
    <li>Is there any <i>fakement</i> whereof it may be <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, this is new? it hath been already of <i>badge</i> time, which was before us.
    </li>
    <li>There is no remembrance of former <i>fakements</i>; <i>nishta</i> shall there be any remembrance of <i>fakements</i> that are to <i>troll</i> with those that shall <i>troll</i> after.
    </li>
    <li>I the <i>cackling homie</i> was <i>dowriest homie</i> over Israel in Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>parkered</i> my <i>thumping cheat</i> to <i>charper</i> and search out by wisdom concerning all <i>fakements</i> that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath <i>Gloria</i> <i>parkered</i> to the <i>homie chavvies</i> of <i>homie</i> to be exercised therewith.
    </li>
    <li>I have <i>vardad</i> all the works that are done under the sun; and, <i>varda</i>, all is <i>spangly</i> and vexation of <i>Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>That which is <i>bent</i> cannot be made <i>hettie</i>: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.
    </li>
    <li>I <i>dished the dirt</i> with mine own <i>thumping cheat</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Lo, I am <i>troll</i> to <i>dowry</i> estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem: <i>any road up</i>, my <i>thumping cheat</i> had <i>dowry</i> experience of wisdom and knowledge.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>parkered</i> my <i>thumping cheat</i> to know wisdom, and to know <i>meshigener</i> and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of <i>Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For in <i>dowry</i> wisdom is <i>dowry</i> grief: and <i>she</i> that increaseth knowledge increaseth <i>sharda</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>I <i>cackled</i> in mine <i>thumping cheat</i>, <i>troll</i> to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, <i>varda</i>, this also is <i>spangly</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I <i>cackled</i> of <i>tittering</i>, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?
    </li>
    <li>I sought in mine <i>thumping cheat</i> to <i>parker</i> myself unto <i>sherry</i>, yet acquainting mine <i>thumping cheat</i> with wisdom; and to <i>lett</i> hold on folly, till I might <i>varda</i> what was that <i>bona</i> for the <i>homie chavvies</i> of <i>homies</i>, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.
    </li>
    <li>I made me <i>dowry</i> works; I builded me <i>latties</i>; I planted me vineyards:
    </li>
    <li>I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits:
    </li>
    <li>I made me pools of <i>aqua</i>, to <i>aqua</i> therewith the wood that <i>parkereth</i> forth trees:
    </li>
    <li>I got me <i>serving homies</i> and maidens, and had <i>serving homies</i> born in my <i>lattie</i>; also I had <i>dowry</i> possessions of <i>dowry</i> and <i>pogey</i> cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:
    </li>
    <li>I gathered me also silver and <i>gelt</i>, and the peculiar <i>gelt</i> of <i>dowriest homies</i> and of the provinces: I gat me <i>homies</i> singers and <i>palones</i> singers, and the delights of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of <i>homies</i>, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts.
    </li>
    <li>So I was <i>dowry</i>, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.
    </li>
    <li>And whatsoever mine <i>ogles</i> <i>fancied</i> I kept not from them, I withheld not my <i>thumping cheat</i> from any joy; for my <i>thumping cheat</i> rejoiced in all my <i>acting dickey</i>: and this was my portion of all my <i>acting dickey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then I looked on all the works that my <i>fambles</i> had wrought, and on the <i>acting dickey</i> that I had laboured to do: and, <i>varda</i>, all was <i>spangly</i> and vexation of <i>Fairy</i>, and there was no profit under the sun.
    </li>
    <li>And I turned myself to <i>varda</i> wisdom, and <i>meshigener</i>, and folly: for what can the <i>homie</i> do that <i>trolleth</i> after the <i>dowriest homie</i>? even that which hath been already done.
    </li>
    <li>Then I <i>vardad</i> that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as <i>sparkle</i> excelleth <i>munge</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The wise <i>homie</i>&#8216;s <i>ogles</i> are in <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>; but the <i>bimbo</i> <i>minceth</i> in <i>munge</i>: and I myself perceived also that <i>una</i> event happeneth to them all.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> I in my <i>thumping cheat</i>, As it happeneth to the <i>bimbo</i>, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I <i>cackled</i> in my <i>thumping cheat</i>, that this also is <i>spangly</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the <i>bimbo</i> for ever; <i>vardaing</i> that which now is in the days to <i>troll</i> shall all be forgotten. And how <i>carketh it</i> the wise <i>homie</i>? as the <i>bimbo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore I hated life; because the <i>acting dickey</i> that is wrought under the sun is <i>naff</i> unto me: for all is <i>spangly</i> and vexation of <i>Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, I hated all my <i>acting dickey</i> which I had <i>lelled</i> under the sun: because I should leave it unto the <i>homie</i> that shall be after me.
    </li>
    <li>And who knoweth whether <i>she</i> shall be a wise <i>homie</i> or a <i>bimbo</i>? yet shall <i>she</i> have rule over all my <i>acting dickey</i> wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is also <i>spangly</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore I <i>trolled</i> about to cause my <i>thumping cheat</i> to despair of all the <i>acting dickey</i> which I <i>lelled</i> under the sun.
    </li>
    <li>For there is a <i>homie</i> whose <i>acting dickey</i> is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a <i>homie</i> that hath not laboured therein shall <i>she</i> leave it for <i>her</i> portion. This also is <i>spangly</i> and a <i>dowry</i> <i>nana</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For what hath <i>homie</i> of all <i>her</i> <i>acting dickey</i>, and of the vexation of <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>, wherein <i>she</i> hath laboured under the sun?
    </li>
    <li>For all <i>her</i> days are <i>shardas</i>, and <i>her</i> travail grief; <i>any road up</i>, <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> <i>lelleth</i> not <i>lettie</i> in the <i>nochy</i>. This is also <i>spangly</i>.
    </li>
    <li>There is <i>nishter</i> <i>benar</i> for a <i>homie</i>, than that <i>she</i> should <i>jarry</i> and <i>buvare</i>, and that <i>she</i> should make <i>her</i> <i>nishta lucoddy</i> enjoy <i>bona</i> in <i>her</i> <i>acting dickey</i>. This also I <i>vardad</i>, that it was from the <i>famble</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For who can <i>jarry</i>, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?
    </li>
    <li>For <i>Gloria</i> giveth to a <i>homie</i> that is <i>bona</i> in <i>her</i> <i>vardaing</i> wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner <i>she</i> giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that <i>she</i> may <i>parker</i> to <i>her</i> that is <i>bona</i> before <i>Gloria</i>. This also is <i>spangly</i> and vexation of <i>Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>To every <i>fakement</i> there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:
    </li>
    <li>A time to be born, and a time to <i>cark it</i>; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;
    </li>
    <li>A time to <i>ferricadoza</i>, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;
    </li>
    <li>A time to <i>parnie</i>, and a time to <i>titter</i>; a time to mourn, and a time to <i>wallop</i>;
    </li>
    <li>A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
    </li>
    <li>A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;
    </li>
    <li>A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep <i>nishta cackle</i>, and a time to <i>cackle</i>;
    </li>
    <li>A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of <i>barney</i>, and a time of peace.
    </li>
    <li>What profit hath <i>she</i> that worketh in that wherein <i>she</i> laboureth?
    </li>
    <li>I have <i>vardad</i> the travail, which <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>parkered</i> to the <i>homie chavvies</i> of <i>homies</i> to be exercised in it.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> hath made every <i>fakement</i> beautiful in <i>her</i> time: also <i>she</i> hath set the world in their <i>thumping cheat</i>, so that no <i>homie</i> can find out the <i>acting dickey</i> that <i>Gloria</i> maketh from the beginning to the end.
    </li>
    <li>I know that there is no <i>bona</i> in them, but for a <i>homie</i> to rejoice, and to do <i>bona</i> in <i>her</i> life.
    </li>
    <li>And also that every <i>homie</i> should <i>jarry</i> and <i>buvare</i>, and enjoy the <i>bona</i> of all <i>her</i> <i>acting dickey</i>, it is the gift of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I know that, whatsoever <i>Gloria</i> doeth, it shall be for ever: <i>nishter</i> can be put to it, <i>nishta</i> any <i>fakement</i> <i>lelled</i> from it: and <i>Gloria</i> doeth it, that <i>homies</i> should fear before <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and <i>Gloria</i> requireth that which is past.
    </li>
    <li>And moreover I <i>vardad</i> under the sun the place of judgment, that <i>naffness</i> was there; and the place of <i>bonaness</i>, that <i>codness</i> was there.
    </li>
    <li>I <i>cackled</i> in mine <i>thumping cheat</i>, <i>Gloria</i> shall <i>beak</i> the <i>bona</i> and the <i>naff</i>: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every <i>acting dickey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I <i>cackled</i> in mine <i>thumping cheat</i> concerning the estate of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of <i>homies</i>, that <i>Gloria</i> might manifest them, and that they might <i>varda</i> that they themselves are beasts.
    </li>
    <li>For that which befalleth the <i>homie chavvies</i> of <i>homies</i> befalleth beasts; even <i>una</i> <i>fakement</i> befalleth them: as the <i>una</i> <i>carketh it</i>, so <i>carketh it</i> the other; <i>any road up</i>, they have all <i>una</i> breath; so that a <i>homie</i> hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is <i>spangly</i>.
    </li>
    <li>All <i>troll</i> unto <i>una</i> place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.
    </li>
    <li>Who knoweth the <i>Fairy</i> of <i>homie</i> that goeth upward, and the <i>Fairy</i> of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore I perceive that there is <i>nishter</i> <i>benar</i>, than that a <i>homie</i> should rejoice in <i>her</i> own works; for that is <i>her</i> portion: for who shall <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> to <i>varda</i> what shall be after <i>her</i>?
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>So I <i>trolled back</i>, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and <i>varda</i> the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore I praised the <i>stiff</i> which are already <i>stiff</i> more than the living which are yet alive.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, <i>benar</i> is <i>she</i> than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not <i>vardad</i> the <i>nana</i> <i>acting dickey</i> that is done under the sun.
    </li>
    <li>Again, I considered all travail, and every <i>sweet</i> <i>acting dickey</i>, that for this a <i>homie</i> is envied of <i>her</i> <i>homie ajax</i>. This is also <i>spangly</i> and vexation of <i>Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>bimbo</i> foldeth <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i> together, and eateth <i>her</i> own flesh.
    </li>
    <li><i>Benar</i> is an handful with quietness, than both the <i>fambles</i> full with travail and vexation of <i>Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then I <i>trolled back</i>, and I <i>vardad</i> <i>spangly</i> under the sun.
    </li>
    <li>There is <i>una</i> alone, and there is not a second; <i>any road up</i>, <i>she</i> hath <i>nishta</i> <i>chavvie</i> <i>nishta</i> <i>sister</i>: yet is there no end of all <i>her</i> <i>acting dickey</i>; <i>nishta</i> is <i>her</i> <i>ogle</i> satisfied with riches; <i>nishta</i> <i>cackleth</i> <i>she</i>, For whom do I <i>acting dickey</i>, and bereave my <i>nishta lucoddy</i> of <i>bona</i>? This is also <i>spangly</i>, <i>any road up</i>, it is a sore travail.
    </li>
    <li><i>Dewey</i> are <i>benar</i> than <i>una</i>; because they have a <i>bona</i> <i>parkering</i> for their <i>acting dickey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For if they fall, the <i>una</i> will lift up <i>her</i> fellow: but woe to <i>her</i> that is alone when <i>she</i> falleth; for <i>she</i> hath not another to help <i>her</i> up.
    </li>
    <li>Again, if <i>dewey</i> lie together, then they have heat: but how can <i>una</i> be warm alone?
    </li>
    <li>And if <i>una</i> prevail against <i>her</i>, <i>dewey</i> shall withstand <i>her</i>; and a <i>treyfold</i> cord is not quickly broken.
    </li>
    <li><i>Benar</i> is a <i>nanti dinarly</i> and a wise <i>chavvie</i> than an <i>badge</i> and <i>dizzy</i> <i>dowriest homie</i>, who will <i>nishta</i> be admonished.
    </li>
    <li>For out of <i>charpering carsey</i> <i>she</i> <i>trolleth</i> to reign; whereas also <i>she</i> that is born in <i>her</i> kingdom becometh <i>nanti dinarly</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I considered all the living which <i>mince</i> under the sun, with the second <i>chavvie</i> that shall stand up in <i>her</i> stead.
    </li>
    <li>There is no end of all the <i>homies and palones</i>, even of all that have been before them: they also that <i>troll</i> after shall not rejoice in <i>her</i>. Surely this also is <i>spangly</i> and vexation of <i>Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Keep thy <i>plate</i> when thou <i>trollest</i> to the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and be more ready to <i>aunt nell</i>, than to <i>parker</i> the <i>parker</i> of fools: for they consider not that they do <i>nana</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Be not rash with thy <i>screech</i>, and let not thine <i>thumping cheat</i> be hasty to utter any <i>fakement</i> before <i>Gloria</i>: for <i>Gloria</i> is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy <i>lavs</i> be <i>nishta dowry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For a dream <i>trolleth</i> through the multitude of business; and a <i>bimbo</i>&#8216;s <i>cackling fakement</i> is known by multitude of <i>lavs</i>.
    </li>
    <li>When thou vowest a vow unto <i>Gloria</i>, defer not to pay it; for <i>she</i> hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.
    </li>
    <li><i>Benar</i> is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.
    </li>
    <li>Suffer not thy <i>screech</i> to cause thy flesh to <i>kertever</i>; <i>nishta</i> <i>cackle</i> thou before the <i>fairy</i>, that it was an error: wherefore should <i>Gloria</i> be angry at thy <i>cackling fakement</i>, and <i>battyfang</i> the <i>acting dickey</i> of thine <i>fambles</i>?
    </li>
    <li>For in the multitude of dreams and many <i>lavs</i> there are also divers <i>spanglies</i>: but fear thou <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>If thou <i>vardest</i> the oppression of the <i>nanti dinarly</i>, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for <i>she</i> that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than they.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the <i>dowriest homie</i> himself is served by the field.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; <i>nishta</i> <i>she</i> that loveth abundance with increase: this is also <i>spangly</i>.
    </li>
    <li>When goods increase, they are increased that <i>jarry</i> them: and what <i>bona</i> is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their <i>ogles</i>?
    </li>
    <li>The <i>letty</i> of a labouring <i>homie</i> is <i>bona</i>, whether <i>she</i> <i>jarry</i> <i>bijou</i> or <i>dowry</i>: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer <i>her</i> to <i>letty</i>.
    </li>
    <li>There is a sore <i>nana</i> which I have <i>vardad</i> under the sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.
    </li>
    <li>But those riches perish by <i>nana</i> travail: and <i>she</i> begetteth a <i>homie chavvie</i>, and there is <i>nishter</i> in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>As <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> forth of <i>her</i> mother&#8217;s womb, <i>nanti zhoosh</i> shall <i>she</i> <i>troll back to</i> <i>troll</i> as <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i>, and shall <i>lell</i> <i>nishter</i> of <i>her</i> <i>acting dickey</i>, which <i>she</i> may carry away in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And this also is a sore <i>nana</i>, that in all points as <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i>, so shall <i>she</i> <i>troll</i>: and what profit hath <i>she</i> that hath laboured for the wind?
    </li>
    <li>All <i>her</i> days also <i>she</i> eateth in <i>munge</i>, and <i>she</i> hath <i>dowry</i> <i>sharda</i> and wrath with <i>her</i> <i>kerterver coddy</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i> that which I have <i>vardad</i>: it is <i>bona</i> and comely for <i>una</i> to <i>jarry</i> and to <i>buvare</i>, and to enjoy the <i>bona</i> of all <i>her</i> <i>acting dickey</i> that <i>she</i> <i>lelleth</i> under the sun all the days of <i>her</i> life, which <i>Gloria</i> giveth <i>her</i>: for it is <i>her</i> portion.
    </li>
    <li>Every <i>homie</i> also to whom <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>parkered</i> riches and <i>metties</i>, and hath <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> power to <i>jarry</i> thereof, and to <i>lell</i> <i>her</i> portion, and to rejoice in <i>her</i> <i>acting dickey</i>; this is the gift of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> shall not <i>dowry</i> remember the days of <i>her</i> life; because <i>Gloria</i> answereth <i>her</i> in the joy of <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>There is an <i>nana</i> which I have <i>vardad</i> under the sun, and it is common among <i>homies</i>:
    </li>
    <li>A <i>homie</i> to whom <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>parkered</i> riches, <i>metties</i>, and honour, so that <i>she</i> wanteth <i>nishter</i> for <i>her</i> <i>nishta lucoddy</i> of all that <i>she</i> desireth, yet <i>Gloria</i> giveth <i>her</i> not power to <i>jarry</i> thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this is <i>spangly</i>, and it is an <i>nana</i> disease.
    </li>
    <li>If a <i>homie</i> beget an <i>chenter</i> <i>chavvies</i>, and live many years, so that the days of <i>her</i> years be many, and <i>her</i> <i>nishta lucoddy</i> be not filled with <i>bona</i>, and also that <i>she</i> have no burial; I <i>cackle</i>, that an untimely birth is <i>benar</i> than <i>she</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> <i>trolleth</i> in with <i>spangly</i>, and departeth in <i>munge</i>, and <i>her</i> name shall be covered with <i>munge</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover <i>she</i> hath not <i>vardad</i> the sun, <i>nishta</i> known any <i>fakement</i>: this hath more <i>lettie</i> than the other.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, though <i>she</i> live a <i>mille</i> years twice <i>cackled</i>, yet hath <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> no <i>bona</i>: <i>nix</i> all <i>troll</i> to <i>una</i> place?
    </li>
    <li>All the <i>acting dickey</i> of <i>homie</i> is for <i>her</i> <i>screech</i>, and yet the appetite is not filled.
    </li>
    <li>For what hath the wise more than the <i>bimbo</i>? what hath the <i>nanti dinarly</i>, that knoweth to <i>mince</i> before the living?
    </li>
    <li><i>Benar</i> is the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>ogles</i> than the wandering of the <i>fancy</i>: this is also <i>spangly</i> and vexation of <i>Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it is <i>homie</i>: <i>nishta</i> may <i>she</i> contend with <i>her</i> that is mightier than <i>she</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Vardaing</i> there be many <i>fakements</i> that increase <i>spangly</i>, what is <i>homie</i> the <i>benar</i>?
    </li>
    <li>For who knoweth what is <i>bona</i> for <i>homie</i> in this life, all the days of <i>her</i> vain life which <i>she</i> spendeth as a shadow? for who can <i>cackle</i> a <i>homie</i> what shall be after <i>her</i> under the sun?
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>A <i>bona</i> name is <i>benar</i> than precious ointment; and the <i>journo</i> of <i>carking it</i> than the <i>journo</i> of <i>una</i>&#8216;s birth.
    </li>
    <li>It is <i>benar</i> to <i>troll</i> to the <i>lattie</i> of mourning, than to <i>troll</i> to the <i>lattie</i> of feasting: for that is the end of all <i>homies</i>; and the living will <i>lett</i> it to <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Sharda</i> is <i>benar</i> than <i>tittering</i>: for by the sadness of the countenance the <i>thumping cheat</i> is made <i>benar</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>thumping cheat</i> of the wise is in the <i>lattie</i> of mourning; but the <i>thumping cheat</i> of fools is in the <i>lattie</i> of mirth.
    </li>
    <li>It is <i>benar</i> to <i>aunt nell</i> the rebuke of the wise, than for a <i>homie</i> to <i>aunt nell</i> the <i>chant</i> of fools.
    </li>
    <li>For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the <i>tittering</i> of the <i>bimbo</i>: this also is <i>spangly</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Surely oppression maketh a wise <i>homie</i> mad; and a gift <i>battyfangeth</i> the <i>thumping cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Benar</i> is the end of a <i>fakement</i> than the beginning thereof: and the patient in <i>Fairy</i> is <i>benar</i> than the proud in <i>Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Be not hasty in thy <i>Fairy</i> to be angry: for <i>wild</i> resteth in the bosom of fools.
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackle</i> not thou, What is the cause that the former days were <i>benar</i> than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.
    </li>
    <li>Wisdom is <i>bona</i> with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that <i>varda</i> the sun.
    </li>
    <li>For wisdom is a defence, and <i>dinarly</i> is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it.
    </li>
    <li>Consider the <i>acting dickey</i> of <i>Gloria</i>: for who can make that <i>hettie</i>, which <i>she</i> hath made <i>bent</i>?
    </li>
    <li>In the <i>journo</i> of prosperity be <i>bona</i>, but in the <i>journo</i> of adversity consider: <i>Gloria</i> also hath set the <i>una</i> over against the other, to the end that <i>homie</i> should find <i>nishter</i> after <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>All <i>fakements</i> have I <i>vardad</i> in the days of my <i>spangly</i>: there is a just <i>homie</i> that perisheth in <i>her</i> <i>bonaness</i>, and there is a <i>naff</i> <i>homie</i> that prolongeth <i>her</i> life in <i>her</i> <i>naffness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Be not <i>bona</i> over <i>dowry</i>; <i>nishta</i> make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou <i>battyfang</i> thyself ?
    </li>
    <li>Be not over <i>dowry</i> <i>naff</i>, <i>nishta</i> be thou <i>dizzy</i>: why shouldest thou <i>cark it</i> before thy time?
    </li>
    <li>It is <i>bona</i> that thou shouldest <i>lell</i> hold of this; <i>any road up</i>, also from this withdraw not thine <i>famble</i>: for <i>she</i> that feareth <i>Gloria</i> shall <i>troll</i> forth of them all.
    </li>
    <li>Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than <i>dacha</i> <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i> which are in the <i>smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For there is not a just <i>homie</i> upon earth, that doeth <i>bona</i>, and <i>kertervereth</i> not.
    </li>
    <li>Also <i>lell</i> no heed unto all <i>lavs</i> that are <i>cackled</i>; lest thou <i>aunt nell</i> thy <i>serving homie</i> curse thee:
    </li>
    <li>For oftentimes also thine own <i>thumping cheat</i> knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.
    </li>
    <li>All this have I proved by wisdom: I <i>cackled</i>, I will be wise; but it was <i>nishter ajax</i> me.
    </li>
    <li>That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?
    </li>
    <li>I applied mine <i>thumping cheat</i> to know, and to search, and to <i>charper</i> out wisdom, and the reason of <i>fakements</i>, and to know the <i>naffness</i> of folly, even of foolishness and <i>meshigener</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And I find more bitter than <i>carking it</i> the <i>palone</i>, whose <i>thumping cheat</i> is snares and nets, and her <i>fambles</i> as bands: whoso pleaseth <i>Gloria</i> shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be <i>lelled</i> by her.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, this have I found, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>cackling homie</i>, counting <i>una</i> by <i>una</i>, to find out the account:
    </li>
    <li>Which yet my <i>nishta lucoddy</i> <i>charpereth</i>, but I find not: <i>una</i> <i>homie</i> among a <i>mille</i> have I found; but a <i>palone</i> among all those have I not found.
    </li>
    <li>Lo, this only have I found, that <i>Gloria</i> hath made <i>homie</i> upright; but they have sought out many inventions.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Who is as the wise <i>homie</i>? and who knoweth the interpretation of a <i>fakement</i>? a <i>homie</i>&#8216;s wisdom maketh <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> to shine, and the boldness of <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> shall be changed.
    </li>
    <li>I counsel thee to keep the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>butch lav</i>, and that in regard of the oath of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Be not hasty to <i>troll out</i> of <i>her</i> <i>vardaing</i>: stand not in an <i>nana</i> <i>fakement</i>; for <i>she</i> doeth whatsoever pleaseth <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Where the <i>lav</i> of a <i>dowriest homie</i> is, there is power: and who may <i>cackle</i> unto <i>her</i>, What doest thou?
    </li>
    <li>Whoso keepeth the <i>butch lav</i> shall feel no <i>nana</i> <i>fakement</i>: and a wise <i>homie</i>&#8216;s <i>thumping cheat</i> discerneth both time and judgment.
    </li>
    <li>Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of <i>homie</i> is <i>dowry</i> upon <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> knoweth not that which shall be: for who can <i>cackle</i> <i>her</i> when it shall be?
    </li>
    <li>There is no <i>homie</i> that hath power over the <i>Fairy</i> to retain the <i>Fairy</i>; <i>nishta</i> hath <i>she</i> power in the <i>journo</i> of <i>carking it</i>: and there is no discharge in that <i>barney</i>; <i>nishta</i> shall <i>naffness</i> deliver those that are <i>parkered</i> to it.
    </li>
    <li>All this have I <i>vardad</i>, and applied my <i>thumping cheat</i> unto every <i>acting dickey</i> that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein <i>una</i> <i>homie</i> ruleth over another to <i>her</i> own hurt.
    </li>
    <li>And so I <i>vardad</i> the <i>naff</i> buried, who had <i>troll</i> and <i>trolled</i> from the place of the <i>fabulosa</i>, and they were forgotten in the <i>smoke</i> where they had so done: this is also <i>spangly</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Because sentence against an <i>nana</i> <i>acting dickey</i> is not executed speedily, therefore the <i>thumping cheat</i> of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of <i>homies</i> is fully set in them to do <i>nana</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Though a sinner do <i>nana</i> an <i>chenter</i> times, and <i>her</i> days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear <i>Gloria</i>, which fear before <i>her</i>:
    </li>
    <li>But it shall not be well with the <i>naff</i>, <i>nishta</i> shall <i>she</i> prolong <i>her</i> days, which are as a shadow; because <i>she</i> feareth not before <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>There is a <i>spangly</i> which is done upon the earth; that there be just <i>homies</i>, unto whom it happeneth according to the <i>acting dickey</i> of the <i>naff</i>; again, there be <i>naff</i> <i>homies</i>, to whom it happeneth according to the <i>acting dickey</i> of the <i>bona</i>: I <i>cackled</i> that this also is <i>spangly</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then I commended mirth, because a <i>homie</i> hath no <i>benar</i> <i>fakement</i> under the sun, than to <i>jarry</i>, and to <i>buvare</i>, and to be merry: for that shall <i>lett</i> with <i>her</i> of <i>her</i> <i>acting dickey</i> the days of <i>her</i> life, which <i>Gloria</i> giveth <i>her</i> under the sun.
    </li>
    <li>When I applied mine <i>thumping cheat</i> to know wisdom, and to <i>varda</i> the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that <i>nishta</i> <i>journo</i> <i>nishta</i> <i>nochy</i> <i>vardaeth</i> <i>letty</i> with <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i>🙂
    </li>
    <li>Then I beheld all the <i>acting dickey</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, that a <i>homie</i> cannot find out the <i>acting dickey</i> that is done under the sun: because though a <i>homie</i> <i>acting dickey</i> to <i>charper</i> it out, yet <i>she</i> shall not find it; <i>any road up</i> farther; though a wise <i>homie</i> think to know it, yet shall <i>she</i> not be able to find it.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>For all this I considered in my <i>thumping cheat</i> even to <i>screech</i> all this, that the <i>bona</i>, and the wise, and their works, are in the <i>famble</i> of <i>Gloria</i>: no <i>homie</i> knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them.
    </li>
    <li>All <i>fakements</i> <i>troll</i> alike to all: there is <i>una</i> event to the <i>bona</i>, and to the <i>naff</i>; to the <i>bona</i> and to the clean, and to the <i>nanti sparkle</i>; to <i>her</i> that sacrificeth, and to <i>her</i> that sacrificeth not: as is the <i>bona</i>, so is the sinner; and <i>she</i> that sweareth, as <i>she</i> that feareth an oath.
    </li>
    <li>This is an <i>nana</i> among all <i>fakements</i> that are done under the sun, that there is <i>una</i> event unto all: <i>any road up</i>, also the <i>thumping cheat</i> of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of <i>homies</i> is full of <i>nana</i>, and <i>meshigener</i> is in their <i>thumping cheat</i> while they live, and after that they <i>troll</i> to the <i>stiff</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For to <i>her</i> that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living <i>girl with a lovely personality</i> is <i>benar</i> than a <i>stiff</i> lion.
    </li>
    <li>For the living know that they shall <i>cark it</i>: but the <i>stiff</i> know not any <i>fakement</i>, <i>nishta</i> have they any more a <i>parkering</i>; for the memory of them is forgotten.
    </li>
    <li>Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; <i>nishta</i> have they any more a portion for ever in any <i>fakement</i> that is done under the sun.
    </li>
    <li><i>Troll</i> thy way, <i>jarry</i> thy <i>pannan</i> with joy, and <i>buvare</i> thy <i>sherry</i> with a merry <i>thumping cheat</i>; for <i>Gloria</i> now accepteth thy works.
    </li>
    <li>Let thy <i>frocks</i> be always white; and let thy <i>eke</i> lack no ointment.
    </li>
    <li>Live joyfully with the <i>palone affair</i> whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy <i>spangly</i>, which <i>she</i> hath <i>parkered</i> thee under the sun, all the days of thy <i>spangly</i>: for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy <i>acting dickey</i> which thou takest under the sun.
    </li>
    <li>Whatsoever thy <i>famble</i> findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no <i>acting dickey</i>, <i>nishta</i> device, <i>nishta</i> knowledge, <i>nishta</i> wisdom, in the grave, whither thou <i>trollest</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I <i>trolled back</i>, and <i>vardad</i> under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, <i>nishta</i> the battle to the <i>butch</i>, <i>nishta</i> yet <i>pannan</i> to the wise, <i>nishta</i> yet riches to <i>homies</i> of understanding, <i>nishta</i> yet favour to <i>homies</i> of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>homie</i> also knoweth not <i>her</i> time: as the fishes that are <i>lelled</i> in an <i>nana</i> net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the <i>homie chavvies</i> of <i>homies</i> snared in an <i>nana</i> time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.
    </li>
    <li>This wisdom have I <i>vardad</i> also under the sun, and it seemed <i>dowry</i> unto me:
    </li>
    <li>There was a <i>bijou</i> <i>smoke</i>, and <i>nishta dowry</i> <i>homies</i> within it; and there <i>trolled</i> a <i>dowry</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> against it, and besieged it, and built <i>dowry</i> bulwarks against it:
    </li>
    <li>Now there was found in it a <i>nanti dinarly</i> wise <i>homie</i>, and <i>she</i> by <i>her</i> wisdom <i>laued</i> the <i>smoke</i>; yet no <i>homie</i> remembered that same <i>nanti dinarly</i> <i>homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> I, Wisdom is <i>benar</i> than <i>butchness</i>: <i>any road up</i> the <i>nanti dinarly</i> <i>homie</i>&#8216;s wisdom is despised, and <i>her</i> <i>lavs</i> are not <i>aunt nelled</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>lavs</i> of wise <i>homies</i> are <i>aunt nelled</i> in quiet more than the <i>screech</i> of <i>her</i> that ruleth among fools.
    </li>
    <li>Wisdom is <i>benar</i> than weapons of <i>barney</i>: but <i>una</i> sinner <i>battyfangeth</i> <i>dowry</i> <i>bona</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Stiff</i> flies cause the ointment of the <i>bolus</i> to <i>lau</i> forth a stinking savour: so doth a <i>bijou</i> folly <i>her</i> that is in reputation for wisdom and honour.
    </li>
    <li>A wise <i>homie</i>&#8216;s <i>thumping cheat</i> is at <i>her</i> <i>sweet martini</i>; but a <i>bimbo</i>&#8216;s <i>thumping cheat</i> at <i>her</i> <i>dry</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> also, when <i>she</i> that is a <i>bimbo</i> <i>minceth</i> by the way, <i>her</i> wisdom faileth <i>her</i>, and <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i> to every <i>una</i> that <i>she</i> is a <i>bimbo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>If the <i>Fairy</i> of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth <i>dowry</i> offences.
    </li>
    <li>There is an <i>nana</i> which I have <i>vardad</i> under the sun, as an error which proceedeth from the ruler:
    </li>
    <li>Folly is set in <i>dowry</i> dignity, and the rich <i>lett</i> in low place.
    </li>
    <li>I have <i>vardad</i> <i>serving homies</i> upon horses, and <i>princesses</i> <i>mincing</i> as <i>serving homies</i> upon the earth.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and <i>she</i> that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.
    </li>
    <li>If the iron be blunt, and <i>she</i> <i>nix</i> whet the edge, then must <i>she</i> put to more <i>butchness</i>: but wisdom is profitable to direct.
    </li>
    <li>Surely the serpent will bite <i>nanti</i> enchantment; and a babbler is no <i>benar</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>lavs</i> of a wise <i>homie</i>&#8216;s <i>screech</i> are <i>bona</i>; but the lips of a <i>bimbo</i> will <i>jarry</i> up himself.
    </li>
    <li>The beginning of the <i>lavs</i> of <i>her</i> <i>screech</i> is foolishness: and the end of <i>her</i> talk is mischievous <i>meshigener</i>.
    </li>
    <li>A <i>bimbo</i> also is full of <i>lavs</i>: a <i>homie</i> cannot <i>cackle</i> what shall be; and what shall be after <i>her</i>, who can <i>cackle</i> <i>her</i>?
    </li>
    <li>The <i>acting dickey</i> of the <i>dizzy</i> wearieth every <i>una</i> of them, because <i>she</i> knoweth not how to <i>troll</i> to the <i>smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Woe to thee, O land, when thy <i>dowriest homie</i> is a <i>chavvie</i>, and thy <i>princesses</i> <i>jarry</i> in the morning!
    </li>
    <li><i>Fabed</i> art thou, O land, when thy <i>dowriest homie</i> is the <i>homie chavvie</i> of nobles, and thy <i>princesses</i> <i>jarry</i> in due season, for <i>butchness</i>, and not for <i>daffiness</i>!
    </li>
    <li>By <i>dowry</i> slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the <i>fambles</i> the <i>lattie</i> droppeth through.
    </li>
    <li>A <i>dowry munjarlee</i> is made for <i>tittering</i>, and <i>sherry</i> maketh merry: but <i>dinarly</i> answereth all <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Curse not the <i>dowriest homie</i>, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy <i>pallias</i>: for a bird of the air shall carry the <i>cackling fakement</i>, and that which hath wings shall <i>cackle</i> the matter.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Cast thy <i>pannan</i> upon the <i>aquas</i>: for thou shalt find it after many days.
    </li>
    <li><i>Parker</i> a portion to <i>setter</i>, and also to <i>say dooe</i>; for thou knowest not what <i>nana</i> shall be upon the earth.
    </li>
    <li>If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> that observeth the wind shall not sow; and <i>she</i> that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.
    </li>
    <li>As thou knowest not what is the way of the <i>Fairy</i>, <i>nishta</i> how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is <i>up the duff</i>: even so thou knowest not the works of <i>Gloria</i> who maketh all.
    </li>
    <li>In the morning sow thy <i>maria</i>, and in the <i>bijou nochy</i> withhold not thine <i>famble</i>: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike <i>bona</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Truly the <i>sparkle</i> is <i>bona</i>, and a <i>dolly</i> <i>fakement</i> it is for the <i>ogles</i> to <i>varda</i> the sun:
    </li>
    <li>But if a <i>homie</i> live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let <i>her</i> remember the days of <i>munge</i>; for they shall be many. All that <i>trolleth</i> is <i>spangly</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Rejoice, O <i>bean cove</i>, in thy <i>beandom</i>; and let thy <i>thumping cheat</i> cheer thee in the days of thy <i>beandom</i>, and <i>mince</i> in the ways of thine <i>thumping cheat</i>, and in the <i>vardaing</i> of thine <i>ogles</i>: but know thou, that for all these <i>fakements</i> <i>Gloria</i> will <i>parker</i> thee into judgment.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore remove <i>sharda</i> from thy <i>thumping cheat</i>, and put away <i>nana</i> from thy flesh: for childhood and <i>beandom</i> are <i>spangly</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy <i>beandom</i>, while the <i>nana</i> days <i>troll</i> not, <i>nishta</i> the years draw <i>ajax</i>, when thou shalt <i>cackle</i>, I have no pleasure in them;
    </li>
    <li>While the sun, or the <i>sparkle</i>, or the moon, or the <i>twinkling fakements</i>, be not <i>munged</i>, <i>nishta</i> the clouds return after the rain:
    </li>
    <li>In the <i>journo</i> when the keepers of the <i>lattie</i> shall tremble, and the <i>manly alices</i> shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are <i>nishta dowry</i>, and those that <i>varda</i> out of the windows be <i>munged</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and <i>she</i> shall rise up at the <i>cackling fakement</i> of the bird, and all the <i>palone chavvies</i> of musick shall be brought low;
    </li>
    <li>Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and <i>fancy</i> shall fail: because <i>homie</i> goeth to <i>her</i> long home, and the mourners <i>troll about</i> the streets:
    </li>
    <li>Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern.
    </li>
    <li>Then shall the dust <i>troll back to</i> the earth as it was: and the <i>Fairy</i> shall return unto <i>Gloria</i> who <i>parkered</i> it.
    </li>
    <li><i>Spangly</i> of <i>spanglies</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>cackling homie</i>; all is <i>spangly</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And moreover, because the <i>cackling homie</i> was wise, <i>she</i> still taught the <i>homies and palones</i> knowledge; <i>any road up</i>, <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> <i>bona</i> heed, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>cackling homie</i> sought to find out acceptable <i>lavs</i>: and that which was <i>screeved</i> was upright, even <i>lavs</i> of truth.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>lavs</i> of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies, which are <i>parkered</i> from <i>una</i> shepherd.
    </li>
    <li>And further, by these, my <i>homie chavvie</i>, be admonished: of making many <i>glossies</i> there is no end; and <i>dowry</i> study is a weariness of the flesh.
    </li>
    <li>Let us <i>aunt nell</i> the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear <i>Gloria</i>, and keep <i>her</i> <i>butch lavs</i>: for this is the whole duty of <i>homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>Gloria</i> shall <i>parker</i> every <i>acting dickey</i> into judgment, with every secret <i>fakement</i>, whether it be <i>bona</i>, or whether it be <i>nana</i>.
