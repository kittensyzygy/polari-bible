    <h1>1 Peter</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Petra</i>, an apostle of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
    </li>
    <li>Elect according to the foreknowledge of <i>Gloria</i> the <i>Auntie</i>, through sanctification of the <i>Fairy</i>, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>: <i>gracie</i> unto you, and peace, be multiplied.
    </li>
    <li><i>Fabed</i> be the <i>Gloria</i> and <i>Auntie</i> of our <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, which according to <i>her</i> abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> from the <i>stiff</i>,
    </li>
    <li>To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,
    </li>
    <li>Who are kept by the power of <i>Gloria</i> through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
    </li>
    <li>Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:
    </li>
    <li>That the trial of your faith, being <i>dowry</i> more precious than of <i>gelt</i> that perisheth, though it be tried with <i>binco fakement</i>, might be found unto praise and honour and <i>fabeness</i> at the appearing of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Whom having not <i>vardad</i>, ye love; in whom, though now ye <i>varda</i> <i>her</i> not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of <i>fabeness</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your <i>nishta lucoddies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the <i>gracie</i> that should <i>troll</i> unto you:
    </li>
    <li>Searching what, or what manner of time the <i>Fairy</i> of <i>Crystal</i> which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of <i>Crystal</i>, and the <i>fabeness</i> that should <i>troll after</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the <i>fakements</i>, which are now reported unto you by them that have <i>cackled</i> the <i>gossip</i> unto you with the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i> <i>laued</i> down from heaven; which <i>fakements</i> the <i>fairies</i> <i>fancy</i> to <i>varda</i> into.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the <i>gracie</i> that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>;
    </li>
    <li>As obedient <i>chavvies</i>, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:
    </li>
    <li>But as <i>she</i> which hath <i>screeched</i> you is <i>fabulosa</i>, so be ye <i>fabulosa</i> in all manner of conversation;
    </li>
    <li>Because it is <i>screeved</i>, Be ye <i>fabulosa</i>; for I am <i>fabulosa</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And if ye <i>screech</i> on the <i>Auntie</i>, who <i>nanti</i> respect of persons judgeth according to every <i>homie</i>&#8216;s <i>acting dickey</i>, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear:
    </li>
    <li>Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible <i>fakements</i>, as silver and <i>gelt</i>, from your vain conversation <i>lalled</i> by tradition from your <i>aunties</i>;
    </li>
    <li>But with the precious blood of <i>Crystal</i>, as of a lamb <i>nanti</i> blemish and <i>nanti</i> spot:
    </li>
    <li>Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,
    </li>
    <li>Who by <i>her</i> do believe in <i>Gloria</i>, that raised <i>her</i> up from the <i>stiff</i>, and <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> <i>fabeness</i>; that your faith and hope might be in <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Vardaing</i> ye have purified your <i>nishta lucoddies</i> in obeying the truth through the <i>Fairy</i> unto unfeigned love of the <i>sisters</i>, <i>varda</i> that ye love <i>una</i> another with a pure <i>thumping cheat</i> fervently:
    </li>
    <li>Being born again, not of corruptible <i>maria</i>, but of incorruptible, by the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, which <i>letteth</i> and <i>letteth</i> for ever.
    </li>
    <li>For all flesh is as grass, and all the <i>fabeness</i> of <i>homie</i> as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> endureth for ever. And this is the <i>lav</i> which by the <i>gossip</i> is <i>cackled</i> unto you.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, all <i>nana</i> speakings,
    </li>
    <li>As newborn babes, <i>fancy</i> the sincere milk of the <i>lav</i>, that ye may grow thereby:
    </li>
    <li>If so be ye have tasted that the <i>Duchess</i> is <i>bona</i>.
    </li>
    <li>To whom <i>trolling</i>, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of <i>homies</i>, but chosen of <i>Gloria</i>, and precious,
    </li>
    <li>Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual <i>lattie</i>, an <i>fabulosa</i> priesthood, to offer up spiritual <i>parkers</i>, acceptable to <i>Gloria</i> by <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore also it is contained in the <i>glossy</i>, <i>varda</i>, I <i>lett</i> in Sion a <i>dowriest</i> corner stone, elect, precious: and <i>she</i> that believeth on <i>her</i> shall not be <i>bamboozled</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Unto you therefore which believe <i>she</i> is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the <i>eke</i> of the corner,
    </li>
    <li>And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the <i>lav</i>, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.
    </li>
    <li>But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an <i>fabulosa</i> nation, a peculiar <i>homies and palones</i>; that ye should shew forth the praises of <i>her</i> who hath <i>screeched</i> you out of <i>munge</i> into <i>her</i> marvellous <i>sparkle</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Which in time past were not a <i>homies and palones</i>, but are now the <i>homies and palones</i> of <i>Gloria</i>: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
    </li>
    <li>Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which <i>barney</i> against the <i>nishta lucoddy</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Having your conversation honest among the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>: that, whereas they <i>cackle</i> against you as evildoers, they may by your <i>bona</i> works, which they shall <i>varda</i>, glorify <i>Gloria</i> in the <i>journo</i> of visitation.
    </li>
    <li>Submit yourselves to every ordinance of <i>homie</i> for the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s sake: whether it be to the <i>dowriest homie</i>, as supreme;
    </li>
    <li>Or unto governors, as unto them that are <i>laued</i> by <i>her</i> for the <i>zsa zsa-ing</i> of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.
    </li>
    <li>For so is the will of <i>Gloria</i>, that with well doing ye may put to <i>nishta cackle</i> the ignorance of <i>dizzy</i> <i>homies</i>:
    </li>
    <li>As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the <i>serving homies</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Honour all <i>homies</i>. Love the brotherhood. Fear <i>Gloria</i>. Honour the <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Serving homies</i>, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the <i>bona</i> and gentle, but also to the froward.
    </li>
    <li>For this is thankworthy, if a <i>homie</i> for conscience toward <i>Gloria</i> endure grief, suffering wrongfully.
    </li>
    <li>For what <i>fabeness</i> is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall <i>lell</i> it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye <i>lell</i> it patiently, this is acceptable with <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For even hereunto were ye <i>screeched</i>: because <i>Crystal</i> also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should <i>troll after</i> <i>her</i> steps:
    </li>
    <li>Who did no <i>kertever</i>, <i>nishta</i> was guile found in <i>her</i> <i>screech</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Who, when <i>she</i> was reviled, reviled not again; when <i>she</i> suffered, <i>she</i> threatened not; but committed himself to <i>her</i> that judgeth righteously:
    </li>
    <li>Who <i>her</i> own self bare our <i>kertervers</i> in <i>her</i> own <i>lucoddy</i> on the tree, that we, being <i>stiff</i> to <i>kertervers</i>, should live unto <i>bonaness</i>: by whose stripes ye were healed.
    </li>
    <li>For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now <i>trolled back</i> unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your <i>nishta lucoddies</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Likewise, ye <i>palone affairs</i>, be in subjection to your own <i>homie affairs</i>; that, if any obey not the <i>lav</i>, they also may <i>nanti</i> the <i>lav</i> be won by the conversation of the <i>palone affairs</i>;
    </li>
    <li>While they <i>varda</i> your chaste conversation coupled with fear.
    </li>
    <li>Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the <i>riah</i>, and of wearing of <i>gelt</i>, or of putting on of <i>schmutter</i>;
    </li>
    <li>But let it be the hidden <i>homie</i> of the <i>thumping cheat</i>, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a <i>camp</i> and quiet <i>Fairy</i>, which is in the <i>vardaing</i> of <i>Gloria</i> of <i>dowry</i> price.
    </li>
    <li>For after this manner in the <i>badge</i> time the <i>fabulosa</i> <i>palones</i> also, who trusted in <i>Gloria</i>, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own <i>homie affairs</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling <i>her</i> <i>Duchess</i>: whose <i>palone chavvies</i> ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.
    </li>
    <li>Likewise, ye <i>homie affairs</i>, <i>lett</i> with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the <i>palone affair</i>, as unto the <i>nellier</i> <i>fakement</i>, and as being heirs together of the <i>gracie</i> of life; that your <i>meshigener mutterings</i> be not hindered.
    </li>
    <li>Finally, be ye all of <i>una</i> mind, having compassion <i>una</i> of another, love as <i>sisters</i>, be pitiful, be courteous:
    </li>
    <li>Not rendering <i>nana</i> for <i>nana</i>, or railing for railing: but contrariwise <i>bona lav</i>; knowing that ye are thereunto <i>screeched</i>, that ye should inherit a <i>bona lav</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> that will love life, and <i>varda</i> <i>bona</i> days, let <i>her</i> refrain <i>her</i> <i>polari</i> from <i>nana</i>, and <i>her</i> lips that they <i>cackle</i> no guile:
    </li>
    <li>Let <i>her</i> eschew <i>nana</i>, and do <i>bona</i>; let <i>her</i> <i>charper</i> peace, and ensue it.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>ogles</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> are over the <i>bona</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> are open unto their <i>meshigener mutterings</i>: but the <i>eke</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> is against them that do <i>nana</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And who is <i>she</i> that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is <i>bona</i>?
    </li>
    <li>But and if ye suffer for <i>bonaness</i>&#8216; sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, <i>nishta</i> be troubled;
    </li>
    <li>But <i>bonafy</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> in your <i>thumping cheats</i>: and be ready always to <i>parker</i> an answer to every <i>homie</i> that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with <i>campness</i> and fear:
    </li>
    <li>Having a <i>bona</i> conscience; that, whereas they <i>cackle</i> <i>nana</i> of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your <i>bona</i> conversation in <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For it is <i>benar</i>, if the will of <i>Gloria</i> be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for <i>nana</i> doing.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>Crystal</i> also hath once suffered for <i>kertervers</i>, the just for the unjust, that <i>she</i> might <i>parker</i> us to <i>Gloria</i>, being put to <i>carking it</i> in the flesh, but quickened by the <i>Fairy</i>:
    </li>
    <li>By which also <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> and <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>fairies</i> in <i>charpering carsey</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of <i>Gloria</i> waited in the days of <i>Norah</i>, while the <i>bijou arkette</i> was a preparing, wherein <i>nishta dowry</i>, that is, <i>say dooe</i> <i>nishta lucoddies</i> were saved by <i>aqua</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a <i>bona</i> conscience toward <i>Gloria</i>,) by the resurrection of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Who is <i>trolled</i> into heaven, and is on the <i>sweet martini</i> of <i>Gloria</i>; <i>fairies</i> and authorities and powers being made subject unto <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Forasmuch then as <i>Crystal</i> hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for <i>she</i> that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from <i>kertever</i>;
    </li>
    <li>That <i>she</i> no longer should live the <i>lettie</i> of <i>her</i> time in the flesh to the lusts of <i>homies</i>, but to the will of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>, when we <i>minced</i> in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of <i>sherry</i>, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:
    </li>
    <li>Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking <i>nana</i> of you:
    </li>
    <li>Who shall <i>parker</i> account to <i>her</i> that is ready to <i>beak</i> the quick and the <i>stiff</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For for this cause was the <i>gossip</i> <i>cackled</i> also to them that are <i>stiff</i>, that they might be judged according to <i>homies</i> in the flesh, but live according to <i>Gloria</i> in the <i>Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But the end of all <i>fakements</i> is at <i>famble</i>: be ye therefore sober, and <i>varda</i> unto <i>meshigener muttering</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And above all <i>fakements</i> have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of <i>kertervers</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Use hospitality <i>una</i> to another <i>nanti</i> grudging.
    </li>
    <li>As every <i>homie</i> hath <i>lalled</i> the gift, even so minister the same <i>una</i> to another, as <i>bona</i> stewards of the manifold <i>gracie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>If any <i>homie</i> <i>cackle</i>, let <i>her</i> <i>cackle</i> as the oracles of <i>Gloria</i>; if any <i>homie</i> minister, let <i>her</i> do it as of the ability which <i>Gloria</i> giveth: that <i>Gloria</i> in all <i>fakements</i> may be glorified through <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. <i>Larlou</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange <i>fakement</i> happened unto you:
    </li>
    <li>But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of <i>Crystal</i>&#8216;s sufferings; that, when <i>her</i> <i>fabeness</i> shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.
    </li>
    <li>If ye be reproached for the name of <i>Crystal</i>, happy are ye; for the <i>Fairy</i> of <i>fabeness</i> and of <i>Gloria</i> resteth upon you: on their part <i>she</i> is <i>nana</i> <i>cackled</i> of, but on your part <i>she</i> is glorified.
    </li>
    <li>But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a <i>sharpering homie</i>, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other <i>homies</i>&#8216;s matters.
    </li>
    <li>Yet if any <i>homie</i> suffer as a Christian, let <i>her</i> not be ashamed; but let <i>her</i> glorify <i>Gloria</i> on this behalf.
    </li>
    <li>For the time is <i>troll</i> that judgment must begin at the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the <i>gossip</i> of <i>Gloria</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And if the <i>bona</i> scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of <i>Gloria</i> commit the keeping of their <i>nishta lucoddies</i> to <i>her</i> in well doing, as unto a <i>fabulous</i> Creator.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>The <i>fungi</i> which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a <i>varda-ing fakement</i> of the sufferings of <i>Crystal</i>, and also a partaker of the <i>fabeness</i> that shall be revealed:
    </li>
    <li>Feed the flock of <i>Gloria</i> which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for <i>manky</i> lucre, but of a ready mind;
    </li>
    <li><i>Nishta</i> as being <i>ladies</i> over <i>Gloria</i>&#8216;s heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>dowriest</i> Shepherd shall appear, ye shall <i>lall</i> a <i>mudge</i> of <i>fabeness</i> that fadeth not away.
    </li>
    <li>Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. <i>Any road up</i>, all of you be subject <i>una</i> to another, and be clothed with humility: for <i>Gloria</i> resisteth the proud, and giveth <i>gracie</i> to the humble.
    </li>
    <li>Humble yourselves therefore under the <i>dowry butch</i> <i>famble</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, that <i>she</i> may exalt you in due time:
    </li>
    <li><i>Chucking</i> all your care upon <i>her</i>; for <i>she</i> careth for you.
    </li>
    <li>Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a <i>butch shrieking</i> lion, <i>minceth</i> about, seeking whom <i>she</i> may devour:
    </li>
    <li>Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your <i>sisters</i> that are in the world.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>Gloria</i> of all <i>gracie</i>, who hath <i>screeched</i> us unto <i>her</i> eternal <i>fabeness</i> by <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i>, after that ye have suffered a while, make you <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i>, stablish, strengthen, settle you.
    </li>
    <li>To <i>her</i> be <i>fabeness</i> and dominion for ever and ever. <i>Larlou</i>.
    </li>
    <li>By Silvanus, a <i>fabulous</i> <i>sister</i> unto you, as I suppose, I have <i>screeved</i> briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true <i>gracie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> wherein ye stand.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>meshigener carsey</i> that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my <i>homie chavvie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Greet ye <i>una</i> another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i>. <i>Larlou</i>.
