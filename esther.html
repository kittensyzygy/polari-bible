    <h1>Esther</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now it <i>trolled</i> to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over an <i>chenter</i> and <i>setter</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i> provinces:)
    </li>
    <li>That in those days, when the <i>dowriest homie</i> Ahasuerus sat on the throne of <i>her</i> kingdom, which was in Shushan the <i>dowry lattie</i>,
    </li>
    <li>In the third year of <i>her</i> reign, <i>she</i> made a <i>dowry munjarlee</i> unto all <i>her</i> <i>princesses</i> and <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and <i>princesses</i> of the provinces, being before <i>her</i>:
    </li>
    <li>When <i>she</i> shewed the riches of <i>her</i> <i>fabe</i> kingdom and the honour of <i>her</i> <i>fantabulosa</i> <i>fabularity</i> many days, even an <i>chenter</i> and fourscore days.
    </li>
    <li>And when these days were expired, the <i>dowriest homie</i> made a <i>dowry munjarlee</i> unto all the <i>homies and palones</i> that were present in Shushan the <i>dowry lattie</i>, both unto <i>dowry</i> and <i>pogey</i>, <i>setter</i> days, in the court of the garden of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>dowry lattie</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords of <i>bona</i> <i>lycra</i> and purple to silver <i>famble cheats</i> and pillars of marble: the beds were of <i>gelt</i> and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and <i>goolie</i>, marble.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>parkered</i> them <i>buvare</i> in <i>fakements</i> of <i>gelt</i>, (the <i>fakements</i> being diverse <i>una</i> from another,) and royal <i>sherry</i> in abundance, according to the state of the <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>bevvying</i> was according to the law; none did compel: for so the <i>dowriest homie</i> had appointed to all the <i>hilda handcuffs</i> of <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>, that they should do according to every <i>homie</i>&#8216;s pleasure.
    </li>
    <li>Also Vashti the <i>dowriest palone</i> made a <i>dowry munjarlee</i> for the <i>palones</i> in the royal <i>lattie</i> which belonged to <i>dowriest homie</i> Ahasuerus.
    </li>
    <li>On the <i>setterth</i> <i>journo</i>, when the <i>thumping cheat</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> was merry with <i>sherry</i>, <i>she</i> commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the <i>setter</i> chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the <i>dowriest homie</i>,
    </li>
    <li>To <i>parker</i> Vashti the <i>dowriest palone</i> before the <i>dowriest homie</i> with the <i>mudge</i> royal, to shew the <i>homies and palones</i> and the <i>princesses</i> her beauty: for she was <i>filly</i> to <i>varda</i> on.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>dowriest palone</i> Vashti refused to <i>troll</i> at the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>butch lav</i> by <i>her</i> chamberlains: therefore was the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>dowry</i> <i>dander</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>wild</i> burned in <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i> to the wise <i>homies</i>, which knew the times, (for so was the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s manner toward all that knew law and judgment:
    </li>
    <li>And the next unto <i>her</i> was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the <i>setter</i> <i>princesses</i> of Persia and Media, which <i>vardad</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>eke</i>, and which sat the first in the kingdom;)
    </li>
    <li>What shall we do unto the <i>dowriest palone</i> Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the <i>butch lav</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?
    </li>
    <li>And Memucan answered before the <i>dowriest homie</i> and the <i>princesses</i>, Vashti the <i>dowriest palone</i> hath not done wrong to the <i>dowriest homie</i> only, but also to all the <i>princesses</i>, and to all the <i>homies and palones</i> that are in all the provinces of the <i>dowriest homie</i> Ahasuerus.
    </li>
    <li>For this deed of the <i>dowriest palone</i> shall <i>troll</i> abroad unto all <i>palones</i>, so that they shall despise their <i>homie affairs</i> in their <i>ogles</i>, when it shall be reported, The <i>dowriest homie</i> Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the <i>dowriest palone</i> to be brought in before <i>her</i>, but she <i>trolled</i> not.
    </li>
    <li>Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media <i>cackle</i> this <i>journo</i> unto all the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>princesses</i>, which have <i>aunt nelled</i> of the deed of the <i>dowriest palone</i>. Thus shall there arise too <i>dowry</i> contempt and wrath.
    </li>
    <li>If it please the <i>dowriest homie</i>, let there <i>troll</i> a royal <i>butch lav</i> from <i>her</i>, and let it be <i>screeved</i> among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti <i>troll</i> <i>nishta</i> before <i>dowriest homie</i> Ahasuerus; and let the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>parker</i> her royal estate unto another that is <i>benar</i> than she.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s decree which <i>she</i> shall make shall be published throughout all <i>her</i> empire, (for it is <i>dowry</i>,) all the <i>palone affairs</i> shall <i>parker</i> to their <i>homie affairs</i> honour, both to <i>dowry</i> and <i>pogey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>cackling</i> pleased the <i>dowriest homie</i> and the <i>princesses</i>; and the <i>dowriest homie</i> did according to the <i>lav</i> of Memucan:
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> letters into all the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s provinces, into every province according to the <i>screeving</i> thereof, and to every <i>homies and palones</i> after their language, that every <i>homie</i> should bear rule in <i>her</i> own <i>lattie</i>, and that it should be published according to the language of every <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>After these <i>fakements</i>, when the wrath of <i>dowriest homie</i> Ahasuerus was appeased, <i>she</i> remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>serving homies</i> that ministered unto <i>her</i>, Let there be <i>filly</i> <i>bean</i> <i>nanti charvers</i> sought for the <i>dowriest homie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And let the <i>dowriest homie</i> appoint <i>hilda handcuffs</i> in all the provinces of <i>her</i> kingdom, that they may gather together all the <i>filly</i> <i>bean</i> <i>nanti charvers</i> unto Shushan the <i>dowry lattie</i>, to the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>palones</i>, unto the custody of Hege the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s chamberlain, keeper of the <i>palones</i>; and let their <i>fakements</i> for purification be <i>parkered</i> them:
    </li>
    <li>And let the maiden which pleaseth the <i>dowriest homie</i> be <i>dowriest palone</i> instead of Vashti. And the <i>fakement</i> pleased the <i>dowriest homie</i>; and <i>she</i> did so.
    </li>
    <li>Now in Shushan the <i>dowry lattie</i> there was a certain <i>kosher homie</i>, whose name was Mordecai, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jair, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Shimei, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Kish, a Benjamite;
    </li>
    <li>Who had been <i>lelled</i> away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been <i>lelled</i> away with Jeconiah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon had <i>lelled</i> away.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, <i>her</i> uncle&#8217;s <i>palone chavvie</i>: for she had <i>nishta</i> <i>Auntie</i> <i>nishta</i> mother, and the maid was <i>filly</i> and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her <i>Auntie</i> and mother were <i>stiff</i>, <i>lelled</i> for <i>her</i> own <i>palone chavvie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So it <i>trolled</i> to pass, when the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>butch lav</i> and <i>her</i> decree was <i>aunt nelled</i>, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the <i>dowry lattie</i>, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the <i>palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the maiden pleased <i>her</i>, and she obtained kindness of <i>her</i>; and <i>she</i> speedily <i>parkered</i> her her <i>fakements</i> for purification, with such <i>fakements</i> as belonged to her, and <i>setter</i> maidens, which were meet to be <i>parkered</i> her, out of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>: and <i>she</i> preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Esther had not shewed her <i>homies and palones</i> <i>nishta</i> her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it.
    </li>
    <li>And Mordecai <i>minced</i> every <i>journo</i> before the court of the <i>palones</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.
    </li>
    <li>Now when every maid&#8217;s turn was <i>troll</i> to <i>troll</i> in to <i>dowriest homie</i> Ahasuerus, after that she had been <i>kenza</i> months, according to the manner of the <i>palones</i>, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, <i>sey</i> months with <i>lube</i> of myrrh, and <i>sey</i> months with <i>bona</i> odours, and with other <i>fakements</i> for the purifying of the <i>palones</i>😉
    </li>
    <li>Then thus <i>trolled</i> every maiden unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>; whatsoever she <i>fancied</i> was <i>parkered</i> her to <i>troll</i> with her out of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>palones</i> unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>In the <i>bijou nochy</i> she <i>trolled</i>, and on the morrow she <i>trolled back</i> into the second <i>lattie</i> of the <i>palones</i>, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she <i>trolled</i> in unto the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>nishta</i>, except the <i>dowriest homie</i> delighted in her, and that she were <i>screeched</i> by name.
    </li>
    <li>Now when the turn of Esther, the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had <i>lelled</i> her for <i>her</i> <i>palone chavvie</i>, was <i>troll</i> to <i>troll</i> in unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>, she required <i>nishter</i> but what Hegai the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s chamberlain, the keeper of the <i>palones</i>, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the <i>vardaing</i> of all them that looked upon her.
    </li>
    <li>So Esther was <i>lelled</i> unto <i>dowriest homie</i> Ahasuerus into <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i> royal in the <i>dachath</i> month, which is the month Tebeth, in the <i>setterth</i> year of <i>her</i> reign.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> loved Esther above all the <i>palones</i>, and she obtained <i>gracie</i> and favour in <i>her</i> <i>vardaing</i> more than all the <i>nanti charvers</i>; so that <i>she</i> set the royal <i>mudge</i> upon her <i>eke</i>, and made her <i>dowriest palone</i> instead of Vashti.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>dowriest homie</i> made a <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry munjarlee</i> unto all <i>her</i> <i>princesses</i> and <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>, even Esther&#8217;s <i>dowry munjarlee</i>; and <i>she</i> made a release to the provinces, and <i>parkered</i> gifts, according to the state of the <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>nanti charvers</i> were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s gate.
    </li>
    <li>Esther had not yet shewed her kindred <i>nishta</i> her <i>homies and palones</i>; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the <i>butch lav</i> of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>In those days, while Mordecai sat in the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s gate, <i>dewey</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were <i>dander</i>, and sought to <i>lett</i> <i>fambles</i> on the <i>dowriest homie</i> Ahasuerus.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>fakement</i> was known to Mordecai, who <i>cackled</i> it unto Esther the <i>dowriest palone</i>; and Esther certified the <i>dowriest homie</i> thereof in Mordecai&#8217;s name.
    </li>
    <li>And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the chronicles before the <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>After these <i>fakements</i> did <i>dowriest homie</i> Ahasuerus promote Haman the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced <i>her</i>, and set <i>her</i> seat above all the <i>princesses</i> that were with <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And all the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>serving homies</i>, that were in the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the <i>dowriest homie</i> had so commanded concerning <i>her</i>. But Mordecai bowed not, <i>nishta</i> did <i>her</i> reverence.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>serving homies</i>, which were in the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s gate, <i>cackled</i> unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>butch lav</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Now it <i>trolled</i> to pass, when they <i>cackled</i> daily unto <i>her</i>, and <i>she</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> not unto them, that they <i>cackled</i> Haman, to <i>varda</i> whether Mordecai&#8217;s matters would stand: for <i>she</i> had <i>cackled</i> them that <i>she</i> was a <i>kosher homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when Haman <i>vardad</i> that Mordecai bowed not, <i>nishta</i> did <i>her</i> reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> thought scorn to <i>lett</i> <i>fambles</i> on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed <i>her</i> the <i>homies and palones</i> of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to <i>battyfang</i> all the <i>kosher homies</i> that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the <i>homies and palones</i> of Mordecai.
    </li>
    <li>In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of <i>dowriest homie</i> Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from <i>journo</i> to <i>journo</i>, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.
    </li>
    <li>And Haman <i>cackled</i> unto <i>dowriest homie</i> Ahasuerus, There is a certain <i>homies and palones</i> scattered abroad and dispersed among the <i>homies and palones</i> in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all <i>homies and palones</i>; <i>nishta</i> keep they the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s laws: therefore it is not for the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s profit to suffer them.
    </li>
    <li>If it please the <i>dowriest homie</i>, let it be <i>screeved</i> that they may be <i>battyfanged</i>: and I will pay <i>dacha</i> <i>mille</i> talents of silver to the <i>fambles</i> of those that have the charge of the business, to <i>parker</i> it into the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s treasuries.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> <i>famble cheat</i> from <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>, and <i>parkered</i> it unto Haman the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Hammedatha the Agagite, the <i>kosher homies</i>&#8216; enemy.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Haman, The silver is <i>parkered</i> to thee, the <i>homies and palones</i> also, to do with them as it seemeth <i>bona</i> to thee.
    </li>
    <li>Then were the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>betty bracelets</i> <i>screeched</i> on the thirteenth <i>journo</i> of the first month, and there was <i>screeved</i> according to all that Haman had commanded unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s lieutenants, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of every <i>homies and palones</i> of every province according to the <i>screeving</i> thereof, and to every <i>homies and palones</i> after their language; in the name of <i>dowriest homie</i> Ahasuerus was it <i>screeved</i>, and sealed with the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>famble cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the letters were <i>laued</i> by posts into all the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s provinces, to <i>battyfang</i>, to <i>ferricadoza</i>, and to cause to perish, all <i>kosher homies</i>, both <i>bean</i> and <i>badge</i>, <i>bijou</i> <i>chavvies</i> and <i>palones</i>, in <i>una</i> <i>journo</i>, even upon the thirteenth <i>journo</i> of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to <i>lell</i> the spoil of them for a prey.
    </li>
    <li>The copy of the <i>screeving</i> for a <i>butch lav</i> to be <i>parkered</i> in every province was published unto all <i>homies and palones</i>, that they should be ready against that <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The posts <i>trolled</i> out, being hastened by the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>butch lav</i>, and the decree was <i>parkered</i> in Shushan the <i>dowry lattie</i>. And the <i>dowriest homie</i> and Haman sat down to <i>buvare</i>; but the <i>smoke</i> Shushan was perplexed.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent <i>her</i> <i>zhoosh</i>, and put on <i>nylon</i> with ashes, and <i>trolled</i> out into the midst of the <i>smoke</i>, and <i>screeched</i> with a loud and a bitter <i>screech</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And <i>trolled</i> even before the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s gate: for none might enter into the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s gate clothed with <i>nylon</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And in every province, whithersoever the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>butch lav</i> and <i>her</i> decree <i>trolled</i>, there was <i>dowry</i> mourning among the <i>kosher homies</i>, and <i>nistha manjarrying</i>, and weeping, and wailing; and many <i>lett</i> in <i>nylon</i> and ashes.
    </li>
    <li>So Esther&#8217;s maids and her chamberlains <i>trolled</i> and <i>cackled</i> it her. Then was the <i>dowriest palone</i> exceedingly grieved; and she <i>laued</i> <i>clobber</i> to clothe Mordecai, and to <i>lell</i> away <i>her</i> <i>nylon</i> from <i>her</i>: but <i>she</i> <i>lalled</i> it not.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>screeched</i> Esther for Hatach, <i>una</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s chamberlains, whom <i>she</i> had appointed to attend upon her, and <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> a <i>butch lav</i> to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was.
    </li>
    <li>So Hatach <i>trolled</i> forth to Mordecai unto the street of the <i>smoke</i>, which was before the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s gate.
    </li>
    <li>And Mordecai <i>cackled</i> <i>her</i> of all that had happened unto <i>her</i>, and of the sum of the <i>dinarly</i> that Haman had promised to pay to the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s treasuries for the <i>kosher homies</i>, to <i>battyfang</i> them.
    </li>
    <li>Also <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> the copy of the <i>screeving</i> of the decree that was <i>parkered</i> at Shushan to <i>battyfang</i> them, to shew it unto Esther, and to <i>screech</i> it unto her, and to charge her that she should <i>troll</i> in unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>, to make supplication unto <i>her</i>, and to make request before <i>her</i> for her <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Hatach <i>trolled</i> and <i>cackled</i> Esther the <i>lavs</i> of Mordecai.
    </li>
    <li>Again Esther <i>cackled</i> unto Hatach, and <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> <i>butch lav</i> unto Mordecai;
    </li>
    <li>All the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>serving homies</i>, and the <i>homies and palones</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether <i>homie</i> or <i>palones</i>, shall <i>troll</i> unto the <i>dowriest homie</i> into the inner court, who is not <i>screeched</i>, there is <i>una</i> law of <i>her</i> to put <i>her</i> to <i>carking it</i>, except such to whom the <i>dowriest homie</i> shall hold out the golden <i>choad</i>, that <i>she</i> may live: but I have not been <i>screeched</i> to <i>troll</i> in unto the <i>dowriest homie</i> these <i>trey dacha</i> days.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>cackled</i> to Mordecai Esther&#8217;s <i>lavs</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, more than all the <i>kosher homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the <i>kosher homies</i> from another place; but thou and thy <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i> shall be <i>battyfanged</i>: and who knoweth whether thou art <i>troll</i> to the kingdom for such a time as this?
    </li>
    <li>Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer,
    </li>
    <li><i>Troll</i>, gather together all the <i>kosher homies</i> that are present in Shushan, and <i>nishta manjarry</i> ye for me, and <i>nishta</i> <i>jarry</i> <i>nishta</i> <i>buvare</i> <i>trey</i> days, <i>nochy</i> or <i>journo</i>: I also and my maidens will <i>nishta manjarry</i> likewise; and so will I <i>troll</i> in unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.
    </li>
    <li>So Mordecai <i>trolled</i> <i>her</i> way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now it <i>trolled</i> to pass on the third <i>journo</i>, that Esther put on her royal <i>schmutter</i>, and stood in the inner court of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, over against the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>: and the <i>dowriest homie</i> sat upon <i>her</i> royal throne in the royal <i>lattie</i>, over against the gate of the <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And it was so, when the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>vardad</i> Esther the <i>dowriest palone</i> standing in the court, that she obtained favour in <i>her</i> <i>vardaing</i>: and the <i>dowriest homie</i> held out to Esther the golden <i>choad</i> that was in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>. So Esther drew near, and <i>reefed</i> the top of the <i>choad</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> unto her, What wilt thou, <i>dowriest palone</i> Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be even <i>parkered</i> thee to the half of the kingdom.
    </li>
    <li>And Esther answered, If it seem <i>bona</i> unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>, let the <i>dowriest homie</i> and Haman <i>troll</i> this <i>journo</i> unto the banquet that I have prepared for <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i>, Cause Haman to make haste, that <i>she</i> may do as Esther hath <i>cackled</i>. So the <i>dowriest homie</i> and Haman <i>trolled</i> to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Esther at the banquet of <i>sherry</i>, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.
    </li>
    <li>Then answered Esther, and <i>cackled</i>, My petition and my request is;
    </li>
    <li>If I have found favour in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and if it please the <i>dowriest homie</i> to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the <i>dowriest homie</i> and Haman <i>troll</i> to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the <i>dowriest homie</i> hath <i>cackled</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>trolled</i> Haman forth that <i>journo</i> <i>bona</i> and with a glad <i>thumping cheat</i>: but when Haman <i>vardad</i> Mordecai in the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s gate, that <i>she</i> stood not up, <i>nishta</i> <i>trolled</i> for <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> was full of indignation against Mordecai.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> Haman refrained himself: and when <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> home, <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> and <i>screeched</i> for <i>her</i> <i>bencoves</i>, and Zeresh <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Haman <i>cackled</i> them of the <i>fabeness</i> of <i>her</i> riches, and the multitude of <i>her</i> <i>chavvies</i>, and all the <i>fakements</i> wherein the <i>dowriest homie</i> had promoted <i>her</i>, and how <i>she</i> had advanced <i>her</i> above the <i>princesses</i> and <i>serving homies</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Haman <i>cackled</i> moreover, <i>any road up</i>, Esther the <i>dowriest palone</i> did let no <i>homie</i> <i>troll</i> in with the <i>dowriest homie</i> unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Yet all this availeth me <i>nishter</i>, so long as I <i>varda</i> Mordecai the <i>kosher homie</i> sitting at the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s gate.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> Zeresh <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i> and all <i>her</i> <i>bencoves</i> unto <i>her</i>, Let a gallows be made of <i>chinker dacha</i> cubits high, and to morrow <i>cackle</i> thou unto the <i>dowriest homie</i> that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then <i>troll</i> thou in merrily with the <i>dowriest homie</i> unto the banquet. And the <i>fakement</i> pleased Haman; and <i>she</i> caused the gallows to be made.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>On that <i>nochy</i> could not the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>letty</i>, and <i>she</i> commanded to <i>parker</i> the <i>glossy</i> of records of the chronicles; and they were <i>varda the lavs</i> before the <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And it was found <i>screeved</i>, that Mordecai had <i>cackled</i> of Bigthana and Teresh, <i>dewey</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to <i>lett</i> <i>famble</i> on the <i>dowriest homie</i> Ahasuerus.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i>, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this? Then <i>cackled</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>serving homies</i> that ministered unto <i>her</i>, There is <i>nishter</i> done for <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i>, Who is in the court? Now Haman was <i>troll</i> into the outward court of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, to <i>cackle</i> unto the <i>dowriest homie</i> to hang Mordecai on the gallows that <i>she</i> had prepared for <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>serving homies</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>varda</i>, Haman standeth in the court. And the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i>, Let <i>her</i> <i>troll</i> in.
    </li>
    <li>So Haman <i>trolled</i> in. And the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, What shall be done unto the <i>homie</i> whom the <i>dowriest homie</i> delighteth to honour? Now Haman thought in <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>, To whom would the <i>dowriest homie</i> delight to do honour more than to myself?
    </li>
    <li>And Haman answered the <i>dowriest homie</i>, For the <i>homie</i> whom the <i>dowriest homie</i> delighteth to honour,
    </li>
    <li>Let the royal <i>schmutter</i> be brought which the <i>dowriest homie</i> useth to wear, and the horse that the <i>dowriest homie</i> rideth upon, and the <i>mudge</i> royal which is set upon <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And let this <i>schmutter</i> and horse be <i>laued</i> to the <i>famble</i> of <i>una</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s most noble <i>princesses</i>, that they may array the <i>homie</i> withal whom the <i>dowriest homie</i> delighteth to honour, and <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> on horseback through the street of the <i>smoke</i>, and proclaim before <i>her</i>, Thus shall it be done to the <i>homie</i> whom the <i>dowriest homie</i> delighteth to honour.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i> to Haman, Make haste, and <i>lell</i> the <i>schmutter</i> and the horse, as thou hast <i>cackled</i>, and do even so to Mordecai the <i>kosher homie</i>, that sitteth at the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s gate: let <i>nishter</i> fail of all that thou hast <i>cackled</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>lelled</i> Haman the <i>schmutter</i> and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought <i>her</i> on horseback through the street of the <i>smoke</i>, and proclaimed before <i>her</i>, Thus shall it be done unto the <i>homie</i> whom the <i>dowriest homie</i> delighteth to honour.
    </li>
    <li>And Mordecai <i>trolled</i> again to the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s gate. But Haman hasted to <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i> mourning, and having <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> covered.
    </li>
    <li>And Haman <i>cackled</i> Zeresh <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i> and all <i>her</i> <i>bencoves</i> every <i>fakement</i> that had befallen <i>her</i>. Then <i>cackled</i> <i>her</i> wise <i>homies</i> and Zeresh <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i> unto <i>her</i>, If Mordecai be of the <i>maria</i> of the <i>kosher homies</i>, before whom thou hast begun to fall, <i>nishta</i> prevail against <i>her</i>, but shalt surely fall before <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And while they were yet talking with <i>her</i>, <i>trolled</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s chamberlains, and hasted to <i>parker</i> Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>So the <i>dowriest homie</i> and Haman <i>trolled</i> to banquet with Esther the <i>dowriest palone</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i> again unto Esther on the second <i>journo</i> at the banquet of <i>sherry</i>, What is thy petition, <i>dowriest palone</i> Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? and it shall be performed, even to the half of the kingdom.
    </li>
    <li>Then Esther the <i>dowriest palone</i> answered and <i>cackled</i>, If I have found favour in thy <i>vardaing</i>, O <i>dowriest homie</i>, and if it please the <i>dowriest homie</i>, let my life be <i>parkered</i> me at my petition, and my <i>homies and palones</i> at my request:
    </li>
    <li>For we are sold, I and my <i>homies and palones</i>, to be <i>battyfanged</i>, to be <i>ferricadoozed</i>, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my <i>polari</i>, although the enemy could not countervail the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s damage.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>dowriest homie</i> Ahasuerus answered and <i>cackled</i> unto Esther the <i>dowriest palone</i>, Who is <i>she</i>, and where is <i>she</i>, that durst presume in <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> to do so?
    </li>
    <li>And Esther <i>cackled</i>, The adversary and enemy is this <i>naff</i> Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the <i>dowriest homie</i> and the <i>dowriest palone</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> arising from the banquet of <i>sherry</i> in <i>her</i> wrath <i>trolled</i> into the <i>dowry lattie</i> garden: and Haman stood up to make request for <i>her</i> life to Esther the <i>dowriest palone</i>; for <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> that there was <i>nana</i> determined against <i>her</i> by the <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>trolled back</i> out of the <i>dowry lattie</i> garden into the place of the banquet of <i>sherry</i>; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther was. Then <i>cackled</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>, Will <i>she</i> force the <i>dowriest palone</i> also before me in the <i>lattie</i>? As the <i>lav</i> <i>trolled</i> out of <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>screech</i>, they covered Haman&#8217;s <i>eke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Harbonah, <i>una</i> of the chamberlains, <i>cackled</i> before the <i>dowriest homie</i>, <i>varda</i> also, the gallows <i>chinker dacha</i> cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who <i>cackled</i> <i>bona</i> for the <i>dowriest homie</i>, standeth in the <i>lattie</i> of Haman. Then the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i>, Hang <i>her</i> thereon.
    </li>
    <li>So they hanged Haman on the gallows that <i>she</i> had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s wrath pacified.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>On that <i>journo</i> did the <i>dowriest homie</i> Ahasuerus <i>parker</i> the <i>lattie</i> of Haman the <i>kosher homies</i>&#8216; enemy unto Esther the <i>dowriest palone</i>. And Mordecai <i>trolled</i> before the <i>dowriest homie</i>; for Esther had <i>cackled</i> what <i>she</i> was unto her.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>lelled</i> off <i>her</i> <i>famble cheat</i>, which <i>she</i> had <i>lelled</i> from Haman, and <i>parkered</i> it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the <i>lattie</i> of Haman.
    </li>
    <li>And Esther <i>cackled</i> yet again before the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and fell down at <i>her</i> <i>plates</i>, and besought <i>her</i> with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and <i>her</i> device that <i>she</i> had devised against the <i>kosher homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>dowriest homie</i> held out the golden <i>choad</i> toward Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the <i>dowriest homie</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackled</i>, If it please the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and if I have favour in <i>her</i> <i>vardaing</i>, and the <i>fakement</i> seem <i>sweet</i> before the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and I be pleasing in <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i>, let it be <i>screeved</i> to reverse the letters devised by Haman the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Hammedatha the Agagite, which <i>she</i> <i>screeved</i> to <i>battyfang</i> the <i>kosher homies</i> which are in all the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s provinces:
    </li>
    <li>For how can I endure to <i>varda</i> the <i>nana</i> that shall <i>troll</i> unto my <i>homies and palones</i>? or how can I endure to <i>varda</i> the destruction of my kindred?
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>dowriest homie</i> Ahasuerus <i>cackled</i> unto Esther the <i>dowriest palone</i> and to Mordecai the <i>kosher homie</i>, <i>varda</i>, I have <i>parkered</i> Esther the <i>lattie</i> of Haman, and <i>her</i> they have hanged upon the gallows, because <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> upon the <i>kosher homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Screeve</i> ye also for the <i>kosher homies</i>, as it liketh you, in the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s name, and seal it with the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>famble cheat</i>: for the <i>screeving</i> which is <i>screeved</i> in the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s name, and sealed with the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>famble cheat</i>, may no <i>homie</i> reverse.
    </li>
    <li>Then were the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>betty bracelets</i> <i>screeched</i> at that time in the third month, that is, the month Sivan, on the <i>trey</i> and <i>dewey dachath</i> <i>journo</i> thereof; and it was <i>screeved</i> according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the <i>kosher homies</i>, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, an <i>chenter</i> <i>dewey dacha</i> and <i>setter</i> provinces, unto every province according to the <i>screeving</i> thereof, and unto every <i>homies and palones</i> after their language, and to the <i>kosher homies</i> according to their <i>screeving</i>, and according to their language.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>screeved</i> in the <i>dowriest homie</i> Ahasuerus&#8217; name, and sealed it with the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>famble cheat</i>, and <i>laued</i> letters by posts on horseback, and riders on mules, camels, and <i>bean</i> dromedaries:
    </li>
    <li>Wherein the <i>dowriest homie</i> granted the <i>kosher homies</i> which were in every <i>smoke</i> to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to <i>battyfang</i>, to <i>ferricadooza</i> and to cause to perish, all the power of the <i>homies and palones</i> and province that would assault them, both <i>bijou</i> ones and <i>palones</i>, and to <i>lell</i> the spoil of them for a prey,
    </li>
    <li>Upon <i>una</i> <i>journo</i> in all the provinces of <i>dowriest homie</i> Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth <i>journo</i> of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.
    </li>
    <li>The copy of the <i>screeving</i> for a <i>butch lav</i> to be <i>parkered</i> in every province was published unto all <i>homies and palones</i>, and that the <i>kosher homies</i> should be ready against that <i>journo</i> to <i>do the rights</i> themselves on their enemies.
    </li>
    <li>So the posts that rode upon mules and camels <i>trolled</i> out, being hastened and pressed on by the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>butch lav</i>. And the decree was <i>parkered</i> at Shushan the <i>dowry lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Mordecai <i>trolled</i> out from the presence of the <i>dowriest homie</i> in royal <i>schmutter</i> of blue and white, and with a <i>dowry</i> <i>mudge</i> of <i>gelt</i>, and with a <i>frock</i> of <i>bona</i> <i>lycra</i> and purple: and the <i>smoke</i> of Shushan rejoiced and was glad.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>kosher homies</i> had <i>sparkle</i>, and gladness, and joy, and honour.
    </li>
    <li>And in every province, and in every <i>smoke</i>, whithersoever the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>butch lav</i> and <i>her</i> decree <i>trolled</i>, the <i>kosher homies</i> had joy and gladness, a <i>dowry munjarlee</i> and a <i>bona</i> <i>journo</i>. And many of the <i>homies and palones</i> of the land became <i>kosher homies</i>; for the fear of the <i>kosher homies</i> fell upon them.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the thirteenth <i>journo</i> of the same, when the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>butch lav</i> and <i>her</i> decree drew near to be put in execution, in the <i>journo</i> that the enemies of the <i>kosher homies</i> hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the <i>kosher homies</i> had rule over them that hated them;)
    </li>
    <li>The <i>kosher homies</i> gathered themselves together in their <i>smokes</i> throughout all the provinces of the <i>dowriest homie</i> Ahasuerus, to <i>lett</i> <i>famble</i> on such as sought their hurt: and no <i>homie</i> could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon all <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and <i>hilda handcuffs</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i>, helped the <i>kosher homies</i>; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them.
    </li>
    <li>For Mordecai was <i>dowry</i> in the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, and <i>her</i> fame <i>trolled</i> out throughout all the provinces: for this <i>homie</i> Mordecai waxed <i>dowrier</i> and <i>dowrier</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thus the <i>kosher homies</i> <i>slapped</i> all their enemies with the stroke of the <i>dowry efink</i>, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto those that hated them.
    </li>
    <li>And in Shushan the <i>dowry lattie</i> the <i>kosher homies</i> <i>ferricadoozaed</i> and <i>battyfanged</i> <i>chinker</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,
    </li>
    <li>And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,
    </li>
    <li>And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,
    </li>
    <li>The <i>dacha</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> of Haman the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Hammedatha, the enemy of the <i>kosher homies</i>, <i>ferricadoozaed</i> they; but on the spoil <i>laued</i> they not their <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>On that <i>journo</i> the number of those that were <i>ferricadoozed</i> in Shushan the <i>dowry lattie</i> was brought before the <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Esther the <i>dowriest palone</i>, The <i>kosher homies</i> have <i>ferricadoozed</i> and <i>battyfanged</i> <i>chinker</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>homies</i> in Shushan the <i>dowry lattie</i>, and the <i>dacha</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> of Haman; what have they done in the <i>lettie</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s provinces? now what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what is thy request further? and it shall be done.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> Esther, If it please the <i>dowriest homie</i>, let it be granted to the <i>kosher homies</i> which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according unto this <i>journo</i>&#8216;s decree, and let Haman&#8217;s <i>dacha</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> be hanged upon the gallows.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> commanded it so to be done: and the decree was <i>parkered</i> at Shushan; and they hanged Haman&#8217;s <i>dacha</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>kosher homies</i> that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth <i>journo</i> also of the month Adar, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> <i>trey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>homies</i> at Shushan; but on the prey they <i>laued</i> not their <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But the other <i>kosher homies</i> that were in the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had <i>lettie</i> from their enemies, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> of their foes <i>setter dacha</i> and <i>chinker</i> <i>mille</i>, but they <i>laued</i> not their <i>fambles</i> on the prey,
    </li>
    <li>On the thirteenth <i>journo</i> of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth <i>journo</i> of the same rested they, and made it a <i>journo</i> of feasting and gladness.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>kosher homies</i> that were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth <i>journo</i> thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth <i>journo</i> of the same they rested, and made it a <i>journo</i> of feasting and gladness.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore the <i>kosher homies</i> of the villages, that <i>letted</i> in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth <i>journo</i> of the month Adar a <i>journo</i> of gladness and feasting, and a <i>bona</i> <i>journo</i>, and of sending portions <i>una</i> to another.
    </li>
    <li>And Mordecai <i>screeved</i> these <i>fakements</i>, and <i>laued</i> letters unto all the <i>kosher homies</i> that were in all the provinces of the <i>dowriest homie</i> Ahasuerus, both <i>ajax</i> and far,
    </li>
    <li>To stablish this among them, that they should keep the fourteenth <i>journo</i> of the month Adar, and the fifteenth <i>journo</i> of the same, yearly,
    </li>
    <li>As the days wherein the <i>kosher homies</i> rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from <i>sharda</i> to joy, and from mourning into a <i>bona</i> <i>journo</i>: that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending portions <i>una</i> to another, and gifts to the <i>nanti dinarly</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>kosher homies</i> undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had <i>screeved</i> unto them;
    </li>
    <li>Because Haman the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the <i>kosher homies</i>, had devised against the <i>kosher homies</i> to <i>battyfang</i> them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to <i>battyfang</i> them;
    </li>
    <li>But when Esther <i>trolled</i> before the <i>dowriest homie</i>, <i>she</i> commanded by letters that <i>her</i> <i>naff</i> device, which <i>she</i> devised against the <i>kosher homies</i>, should return upon <i>her</i> own <i>eke</i>, and that <i>she</i> and <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> should be hanged on the gallows.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore they <i>screeched</i> these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore for all the <i>lavs</i> of this letter, and of that which they had <i>vardad</i> concerning this matter, and which had <i>troll</i> unto them,
    </li>
    <li>The <i>kosher homies</i> ordained, and <i>lelled</i> upon them, and upon their <i>maria</i>, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these <i>dewey</i> days according to their <i>screeving</i>, and according to their appointed time every year;
    </li>
    <li>And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every <i>smoke</i>; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the <i>kosher homies</i>, <i>nishta</i> the memorial of them perish from their <i>maria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then Esther the <i>dowriest palone</i>, the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Abihail, and Mordecai the <i>kosher homie</i>, <i>screeved</i> with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> the letters unto all the <i>kosher homies</i>, to the <i>chenter</i> <i>dewey dacha</i> and <i>setter</i> provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with <i>lavs</i> of peace and truth,
    </li>
    <li>To confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed, according as Mordecai the <i>kosher homie</i> and Esther the <i>dowriest palone</i> had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their <i>maria</i>, the matters of the <i>nishta manjarryings</i> and their <i>screech</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> Ahasuerus <i>laued</i> a tribute upon the land, and upon the isles of the sea.
    </li>
    <li>And all the acts of <i>her</i> power and of <i>her</i> might, and the declaration of the <i>dowriness</i> of Mordecai, whereunto the <i>dowriest homie</i> advanced <i>her</i>, are they not <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the chronicles of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Media and Persia?
    </li>
    <li>For Mordecai the <i>kosher homie</i> was next unto <i>dowriest homie</i> Ahasuerus, and <i>dowry</i> among the <i>kosher homies</i>, and accepted of the multitude of <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, seeking the <i>metties</i> of <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, and speaking peace to all <i>her</i> <i>maria</i>.
