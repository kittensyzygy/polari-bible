    <h1>Judges</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<ol>
<li>Now after the <i>carking it</i> of Joshua it <i>trolled</i> to pass, that the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel asked the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Who shall <i>troll</i> up for us against the Canaanites first, to <i>palaver</i> against them?
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i>, Judah shall <i>troll</i> up: <i>varda</i>, I have <i>laued</i> the land into <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>.
</li>
<li>And Judah <i>cackled</i> unto Simeon <i>her</i> <i>sister</i>, <i>troll</i> up with me into my lot, that we may <i>palaver</i> against the Canaanites; and I likewise will <i>troll</i> with thee into thy lot. So Simeon <i>trolled</i> with <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And Judah <i>trolled</i> up; and the <i>Duchess</i> <i>laued</i> the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their <i>famble</i>: and they <i>ferricadoozaed</i> of them in Bezek <i>dacha</i> <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i>.
</li>
<li>And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they <i>palavered</i> against <i>her</i>, and they <i>ferricadoozaed</i> the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
</li>
<li>But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after <i>her</i>, and caught <i>her</i>, and cut off <i>her</i> thumbs and <i>her</i> <i>dowry</i> toes.
</li>
<li>And Adonibezek <i>cackled</i>, <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> and <i>dacha</i> <i>dowriest homies</i>, having their thumbs and their <i>dowry</i> toes cut off, gathered their <i>carnish</i> under my table: as I have done, so <i>Gloria</i> hath requited me. And they brought <i>her</i> to Jerusalem, and there <i>she</i> <i>carked it</i>.
</li>
<li>Now the <i>chavvies</i> of Judah had <i>palavered</i> against Jerusalem, and had <i>lelled</i> it, and smitten it with the edge of the <i>dowry efink</i>, and set the <i>smoke</i> on <i>binco fakement</i>.
</li>
<li>And afterward the <i>chavvies</i> of Judah <i>trolled</i> down to <i>palaver</i> against the Canaanites, that <i>letted</i> in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.
</li>
<li>And Judah <i>trolled</i> against the Canaanites that <i>letted</i> in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they <i>ferricadoozaed</i> Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.
</li>
<li>And from thence <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher:
</li>
<li>And Caleb <i>cackled</i>, <i>she</i> that <i>slappeth</i> Kirjathsepher, and <i>lelleth</i> it, to <i>her</i> will I <i>parker</i> Achsah my <i>palone chavvie</i> to <i>palone affair</i>.
</li>
<li>And Othniel the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Kenaz, Caleb&#8217;s younger <i>sister</i>, <i>lelled</i> it: and <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> Achsah <i>her</i> <i>palone chavvie</i> to <i>palone affair</i>.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i>, when she <i>trolled</i> to <i>her</i>, that she <i>trolled</i> <i>her</i> to ask of her <i>Auntie</i> a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb <i>cackled</i> unto her, What wilt thou?
</li>
<li>And she <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>parker</i> me a <i>bona lav</i>: for thou hast <i>parkered</i> me a south land; <i>parker</i> me also springs of <i>aqua</i>. And Caleb <i>parkered</i> her the upper springs and the nether springs.
</li>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of the Kenite, <i>Maureen</i>&#8216; <i>Auntie</i> in law, <i>trolled</i> up out of the <i>smoke</i> of palm trees with the <i>chavvies</i> of Judah into the <i>nishta smoke</i> of Judah, which <i>lettieth</i> in the south of Arad; and they <i>trolled</i> and <i>letted</i> among the <i>homies and palones</i>.
</li>
<li>And Judah <i>trolled</i> with Simeon <i>her</i> <i>sister</i>, and they <i>ferricadoozaed</i> the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly <i>battyfanged</i> it. And the name of the <i>smoke</i> was <i>screeched</i> Hormah.
</li>
<li>Also Judah <i>lelled</i> Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> was with Judah; and <i>she</i> drave out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had <i>rattling coves</i> of iron.
</li>
<li>And they <i>parkered</i> Hebron unto Caleb, as <i>Maureen</i> <i>cackled</i>: and <i>she</i> expelled thence the <i>trey</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> of Anak.
</li>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites <i>lett</i> with the <i>chavvies</i> of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this <i>journo</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Josephine</i>, they also <i>trolled</i> up against Bethel: and the <i>Duchess</i> was with them.
</li>
<li>And the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Josephine</i> <i>laued</i> to descry Bethel. (Now the name of the <i>smoke</i> before was Luz. )
</li>
<li>And the spies <i>vardad</i> a <i>homie</i> <i>troll</i> forth out of the <i>smoke</i>, and they <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the <i>smoke</i>, and we will shew thee mercy.
</li>
<li>And when <i>she</i> shewed them the entrance into the <i>smoke</i>, they <i>slapped</i> the <i>smoke</i> with the edge of the <i>dowry efink</i>; but they let <i>troll</i> the <i>homie</i> and all <i>her</i> family.
</li>
<li>And the <i>homie</i> <i>trolled</i> into the land of the Hittites, and built a <i>smoke</i>, and <i>screeched</i> the name thereof Luz: which is the name thereof unto this <i>journo</i>.
</li>
<li><i>Nishta</i> did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and her towns, <i>nishta</i> Taanach and her towns, <i>nishta</i> the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, <i>nishta</i> the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, <i>nishta</i> the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would <i>lett</i> in that land.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i>, when Israel was <i>butch</i>, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.
</li>
<li><i>Nishta</i> did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that <i>letted</i> in Gezer; but the Canaanites <i>letted</i> in Gezer among them.
</li>
<li><i>Nishta</i> did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, <i>nishta</i> the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites <i>letted</i> among them, and became tributaries.
</li>
<li><i>Nishta</i> did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, <i>nishta</i> the inhabitants of Zidon, <i>nishta</i> of Ahlab, <i>nishta</i> of Achzib, <i>nishta</i> of Helbah, <i>nishta</i> of Aphik, <i>nishta</i> of Rehob:
</li>
<li>But the Asherites <i>letted</i> among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out.
</li>
<li><i>Nishta</i> did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, <i>nishta</i> the inhabitants of Bethanath; but <i>she</i> <i>letted</i> among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: <i>any road up</i> the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them.
</li>
<li>And the Amorites forced the <i>chavvies</i> of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to <i>troll</i> down to the valley:
</li>
<li>But the Amorites would <i>lett</i> in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the <i>famble</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Josephine</i> prevailed, so that they became tributaries.
</li>
<li>And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<ol>
<li>And an <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> up from Gilgal to Bochim, and <i>cackled</i>, I made you to <i>troll</i> up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your <i>aunties</i>; and I <i>cackled</i>, I will never break my covenant with you.
</li>
<li>And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my <i>cackling fakement</i>: why have ye done this?
</li>
<li>Wherefore I also <i>cackled</i>, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i>, when the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> these <i>lavs</i> unto all the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, that the <i>homies and palones</i> lifted up their <i>cackling fakement</i>, and <i>parnied</i>.
</li>
<li>And they <i>screeched</i> the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto the <i>Duchess</i>.
</li>
<li>And when Joshua had let the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>troll</i>, the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>trolled</i> every <i>homie</i> unto <i>her</i> inheritance to possess the land.
</li>
<li>And the <i>homies and palones</i> served the <i>Duchess</i> all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the <i>fungi</i> that outlived Joshua, who had <i>vardad</i> all the <i>dowry</i> works of the <i>Duchess</i>, that <i>she</i> did for Israel.
</li>
<li>And Joshua the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nun, the <i>serving homie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>carked it</i>, being an <i>chenter</i> and <i>dacha</i> years <i>badge</i>.
</li>
<li>And they buried <i>her</i> in the border of <i>her</i> inheritance in Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.
</li>
<li>And also all that generation were gathered unto their <i>aunties</i>: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>nishta</i> yet the works which <i>she</i> had done for Israel.
</li>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel did <i>nana</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and served Baalim:
</li>
<li>And they forsook the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of their <i>aunties</i>, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and <i>trolled after</i> other gods, of the gods of the <i>homies and palones</i> that were round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the <i>Duchess</i> to <i>wild</i>.
</li>
<li>And they forsook the <i>Duchess</i>, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.
</li>
<li>And the <i>wild</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> was hot against Israel, and <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> them into the <i>fambles</i> of spoilers that spoiled them, and <i>she</i> sold them into the <i>fambles</i> of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.
</li>
<li>Whithersoever they <i>trolled</i> out, the <i>famble</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> was against them for <i>nana</i>, as the <i>Duchess</i> had <i>cackled</i>, and as the <i>Duchess</i> had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i> the <i>Duchess</i> raised up <i>beaks</i>, which <i>laued</i> them out of the <i>famble</i> of those that spoiled them.
</li>
<li>And yet they would not <i>aunt nell</i> unto their <i>beaks</i>, but they <i>trolled</i> a <i>bitaining</i> after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their <i>aunties</i> <i>minced</i> in, obeying the <i>butch lavs</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>; but they did not so.
</li>
<li>And when the <i>Duchess</i> raised them up <i>beaks</i>, then the <i>Duchess</i> was with the <i>beak</i>, and <i>laued</i> them out of the <i>famble</i> of their enemies all the days of the <i>beak</i>: for it repented the <i>Duchess</i> because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i>, when the <i>beak</i> was <i>stiff</i>, that they <i>trolled back</i>, and corrupted themselves more than their <i>aunties</i>, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own doings, <i>nishta</i> from their stubborn way.
</li>
<li>And the <i>wild</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> was hot against Israel; and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Because that this <i>homies and palones</i> hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their <i>aunties</i>, and have not <i>aunt nelled</i> unto my <i>cackling fakement</i>;
</li>
<li>I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua <i>dry</i> when <i>she</i> <i>carked it</i>:
</li>
<li>That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the <i>Duchess</i> to <i>mince</i> therein, as their <i>aunties</i> did keep it, or not.
</li>
<li>Therefore the <i>Duchess</i> <i>dry</i> those nations, <i>nanti</i> driving them out hastily; <i>nishta</i> <i>laued</i> <i>she</i> them into the <i>famble</i> of Joshua.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<ol>
<li>Now these are the nations which the <i>Duchess</i> <i>dry</i>, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;
</li>
<li>Only that the <i>chavvies</i> of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel might know, to teach them <i>barney</i>, at the <i>nanti dowriest</i> such as before knew <i>nishter</i> thereof;
</li>
<li>Namely, <i>chinker</i> <i>ladies</i> of the <i>naffs</i>, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that <i>letted</i> in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.
</li>
<li>And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would <i>aunt nell</i> unto the <i>butch lavs</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, which <i>she</i> commanded their <i>aunties</i> by the <i>famble</i> of <i>Maureen</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>letted</i> among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:
</li>
<li>And they <i>lelled</i> their <i>palone chavvies</i> to be their <i>palone affairs</i>, and <i>parkered</i> their <i>palone chavvies</i> to their <i>homie chavvies</i>, and served their gods.
</li>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel did <i>nana</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and forgat the <i>Duchess</i> their <i>Gloria</i>, and served Baalim and the groves.
</li>
<li>Therefore the <i>wild</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> was hot against Israel, and <i>she</i> sold them into the <i>famble</i> of Chushanrishathaim <i>dowriest homie</i> of Mesopotamia: and the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel served Chushanrishathaim <i>say dooe</i> years.
</li>
<li>And when the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>screeched</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>, the <i>Duchess</i> raised up a deliverer to the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, who <i>laued</i> them, even Othniel the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Kenaz, Caleb&#8217;s younger <i>sister</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> upon <i>her</i>, and <i>she</i> judged Israel, and <i>trolled</i> out to <i>barney</i>: and the <i>Duchess</i> <i>laued</i> Chushanrishathaim <i>dowriest homie</i> of Mesopotamia into <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>; and <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.
</li>
<li>And the land had <i>lettie</i> <i>quarter dacha</i> years. And Othniel the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Kenaz <i>carked it</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel did <i>nana</i> again in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>: and the <i>Duchess</i> strengthened Eglon the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Moab against Israel, because they had done <i>nana</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> gathered unto <i>her</i> the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon and Amalek, and <i>trolled</i> and <i>slapped</i> Israel, and possessed the <i>smoke</i> of palm trees.
</li>
<li>So the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel served Eglon the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Moab eighteen years.
</li>
<li>But when the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>screeched</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>, the <i>Duchess</i> raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Gera, a Benjamite, a <i>homie</i> lefthanded: and by <i>her</i> the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>laued</i> a present unto Eglon the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Moab.
</li>
<li>But Ehud made <i>her</i> a dagger which had <i>dewey</i> edges, of a cubit length; and <i>she</i> did gird it under <i>her</i> <i>clobber</i> upon <i>her</i> <i>sweet</i> thigh.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> brought the present unto Eglon <i>dowriest homie</i> of Moab: and Eglon was a <i>dowry</i> fat <i>homie</i>.
</li>
<li>And when <i>she</i> had made an end to offer the present, <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> away the <i>homies and palones</i> that bare the present.
</li>
<li>But <i>she</i> himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and <i>cackled</i>, I have a secret errand unto thee, O <i>dowriest homie</i>: who <i>cackled</i>, Keep <i>nishta cackle</i>. And all that stood by <i>her</i> <i>trolled</i> out from <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And Ehud <i>trolled</i> unto <i>her</i>; and <i>she</i> was sitting in a summer parlour, which <i>she</i> had for himself alone. And Ehud <i>cackled</i>, I have a message from <i>Gloria</i> unto thee. And <i>she</i> arose out of <i>her</i> seat.
</li>
<li>And Ehud put forth <i>her</i> <i>dry martini</i>, and <i>lelled</i> the dagger from <i>her</i> <i>sweet</i> thigh, and thrust it into <i>her</i> belly:
</li>
<li>And the haft also <i>trolled</i> in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that <i>she</i> could not draw the dagger out of <i>her</i> belly; and the dirt <i>trolled</i> out.
</li>
<li>Then Ehud <i>trolled</i> forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon <i>her</i>, and locked them.
</li>
<li>When <i>she</i> was <i>trolled</i> out, <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i> <i>trolled</i>; and when they <i>vardad</i> that, <i>varda</i>, the doors of the parlour were locked, they <i>cackled</i>, Surely <i>she</i> covereth <i>her</i> <i>plates</i> in <i>her</i> summer <i>booth</i>.
</li>
<li>And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, <i>varda</i>, <i>she</i> opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they <i>lelled</i> a key, and opened them: and, <i>varda</i>, their <i>Duchess</i> was fallen down <i>stiff</i> on the earth.
</li>
<li>And Ehud <i>scarpered</i> while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and <i>scarpered</i> unto Seirath.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i>, when <i>she</i> was <i>troll</i>, that <i>she</i> blew a <i>tooting fakement</i> in the mountain of Ephraim, and the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>trolled</i> down with <i>her</i> from the mount, and <i>she</i> before them.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>troll after</i> after me: for the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>laued</i> your enemies the Moabites into your <i>famble</i>. And they <i>trolled</i> down after <i>her</i>, and <i>lelled</i> the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a <i>homie</i> to <i>troll over</i>.
</li>
<li>And they <i>ferricadoozaed</i> of Moab at that time about <i>dacha</i> <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i>, all lusty, and all <i>homies</i> of valour; and there <i>scarpered</i> not a <i>homie</i>.
</li>
<li>So Moab was subdued that <i>journo</i> under the <i>famble</i> of Israel. And the land had <i>lettie</i> fourscore years.
</li>
<li>And after <i>her</i> was Shamgar the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Anath, which <i>ferricadoozaed</i> of the <i>naffs</i> <i>sey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>homies</i> with an ox goad: and <i>she</i> also <i>laued</i> Israel.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<ol>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel again did <i>nana</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, when Ehud was <i>stiff</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> sold them into the <i>famble</i> of Jabin <i>dowriest homie</i> of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which <i>letted</i> in Harosheth of the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>screeched</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>: for <i>she</i> had <i>sey trey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>rattling coves</i> of iron; and <i>dewey dacha</i> years <i>she</i> mightily oppressed the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel.
</li>
<li>And Deborah, a prophetess, the <i>palone affair</i> of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.
</li>
<li>And she <i>letted</i> under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>trolled</i> up to her for judgment.
</li>
<li>And she <i>laued</i> and <i>screeched</i> Barak the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Hath not the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel commanded, <i>cackling</i>, <i>troll</i> and draw toward mount Tabor, and <i>lell</i> with thee <i>dacha</i> <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i> of the <i>chavvies</i> of Naphtali and of the <i>chavvies</i> of Zebulun?
</li>
<li>And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin&#8217;s army, with <i>her</i> <i>rattling coves</i> and <i>her</i> multitude; and I will deliver <i>her</i> into thine <i>famble</i>.
</li>
<li>And Barak <i>cackled</i> unto her, If thou wilt <i>troll</i> with me, then I will <i>troll</i>: but if thou wilt not <i>troll</i> with me, then I will not <i>troll</i>.
</li>
<li>And she <i>cackled</i>, I will surely <i>troll</i> with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the <i>Duchess</i> shall sell Sisera into the <i>famble</i> of a <i>palone</i>. And Deborah arose, and <i>trolled</i> with Barak to Kedesh.
</li>
<li>And Barak <i>screeched</i> Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> up with <i>dacha</i> <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i> at <i>her</i> <i>plates</i>: and Deborah <i>trolled</i> up with <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the <i>chavvies</i> of Hobab the <i>Auntie</i> in law of <i>Maureen</i>, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched <i>her</i> <i>trolling lettie</i> unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.
</li>
<li>And they shewed Sisera that Barak the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Abinoam was <i>trolled</i> up to mount Tabor.
</li>
<li>And Sisera gathered together all <i>her</i> <i>rattling coves</i>, even <i>sey trey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>rattling coves</i> of iron, and all the <i>homies and palones</i> that were with <i>her</i>, from Harosheth of the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> unto the river of Kishon.
</li>
<li>And Deborah <i>cackled</i> unto Barak, Up; for this is the <i>journo</i> in which the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>laued</i> Sisera into thine <i>famble</i>: is not the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> out before thee? So Barak <i>trolled</i> down from mount Tabor, and <i>dacha</i> <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i> after <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> discomfited Sisera, and all <i>her</i> <i>rattling coves</i>, and all <i>her</i> host, with the edge of the <i>dowry efink</i> before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off <i>her</i> <i>trundling cheat</i>, and fled away on <i>her</i> <i>plates</i>.
</li>
<li>But Barak pursued after the <i>rattling coves</i>, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the <i>dowry efink</i>; and there was not a <i>homie</i> <i>dry</i>.
</li>
<li>Howbeit Sisera fled away on <i>her</i> <i>plates</i> to the <i>trolling lettie</i> of Jael the <i>palone affair</i> of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Hazor and the <i>lattie</i> of Heber the Kenite.
</li>
<li>And Jael <i>trolled</i> out to meet Sisera, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Turn in, my <i>Duchess</i>, turn in to me; fear not. And when <i>she</i> had turned in unto her into the <i>trolling lettie</i>, she covered <i>her</i> with a mantle.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto her, <i>parker</i> me, I pray thee, a <i>bijou</i> <i>aqua</i> to <i>buvare</i>; for I am thirsty. And she opened a <i>schooner</i> of milk, and <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> <i>buvare</i>, and covered <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>Again <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto her, Stand in the door of the <i>trolling lettie</i>, and it shall be, when any <i>homie</i> doth <i>troll</i> and enquire of thee, and <i>cackle</i>, Is there any <i>homie</i> here? that thou shalt <i>cackle</i>, No.
</li>
<li>Then Jael Heber&#8217;s <i>palone affair</i> <i>lelled</i> a nail of the <i>trolling lettie</i>, and <i>lelled</i> an hammer in her <i>famble</i>, and <i>trolled</i> softly unto <i>her</i>, and <i>slapped</i> the nail into <i>her</i> temples, and fastened it into the ground: for <i>she</i> was <i>nishta manjarry</i> asleep and <i>a stretcher case</i>. So <i>she</i> <i>carked it</i>.
</li>
<li>And, <i>varda</i>, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael <i>trolled</i> out to meet <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>troll</i>, and I will shew thee the <i>homie</i> whom thou <i>charperest</i>. And when <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> into her <i>trolling lettie</i>, <i>varda</i>, Sisera <i>lett</i> <i>stiff</i>, and the nail was in <i>her</i> temples.
</li>
<li>So <i>Gloria</i> subdued on that <i>journo</i> Jabin the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Canaan before the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel.
</li>
<li>And the <i>famble</i> of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Canaan, until they had <i>battyfanged</i> Jabin <i>dowriest homie</i> of Canaan.

<li>Then sang Deborah and Barak the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Abinoam on that <i>journo</i>, <i>cackling</i>,
</li>
<li>Praise ye the <i>Duchess</i> for the avenging of Israel, when the <i>homies and palones</i> willingly offered themselves.
</li>
<li><i>Aunt nell</i>, O ye <i>dowriest homies</i>; <i>parker</i> <i>aunt nelling cheat</i>, O ye <i>princesses</i>; I, even I, will sing unto the <i>Duchess</i>; I will sing praise to the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel.
</li>
<li><i>Duchess</i>, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou <i>mincedst butchly</i> out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped <i>aqua</i>.
</li>
<li>The mountains melted from before the <i>Duchess</i>, even that Sinai from before the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel.
</li>
<li>In the days of Shamgar the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers <i>minced</i> through byways.
</li>
<li>The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.
</li>
<li>They chose new gods; then was <i>barney</i> in the gates: was there a shield or spear <i>vardad</i> among <i>quarter dacha</i> <i>mille</i> in Israel?
</li>
<li>My <i>thumping cheat</i> is toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the <i>homies and palones</i>. Bless ye the <i>Duchess</i>.
</li>
<li><i>Cackle</i>, ye that ride on white asses, ye that <i>lett</i> in judgment, and <i>mince</i> by the way.
</li>
<li>They that are <i>laued</i> from the <i>screech</i> of archers in the places of drawing <i>aqua</i>, there shall they rehearse the <i>bona</i> acts of the <i>Duchess</i>, even the <i>bona</i> acts toward the inhabitants of <i>her</i> villages in Israel: then shall the <i>homies and palones</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>troll</i> down to the gates.
</li>
<li>Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a <i>chant</i>: arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou <i>homie chavvie</i> of Abinoam.
</li>
<li>Then <i>she</i> made <i>her</i> that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the <i>homies and palones</i>: the <i>Duchess</i> made me have dominion over the <i>dowry butch</i>.
</li>
<li>Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after thee, Benjamin, among thy <i>homies and palones</i>; out of Machir <i>trolled</i> down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.
</li>
<li>And the <i>princesses</i> of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar, and also Barak: <i>she</i> was <i>laued</i> on <i>plate</i> into the valley. For the divisions of Reuben there were <i>dowry</i> thoughts of <i>thumping cheat</i>.
</li>
<li>Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to <i>aunt nell</i> the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were <i>dowry</i> searchings of <i>thumping cheat</i>.
</li>
<li>Gilead <i>letted</i> beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in <i>latties on water</i>? Asher continued on the sea shore, and <i>letted</i> in <i>her</i> breaches.
</li>
<li>Zebulun and Naphtali were a <i>homies and palones</i> that jeoparded their lives unto the <i>carking it</i> in the high places of the field.
</li>
<li>The <i>dowriest homies</i> <i>trolled</i> and <i>palavered</i>, then <i>palavered</i> the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Canaan in Taanach by the <i>aquas</i> of Megiddo; they <i>lelled</i> no gain of <i>dinarly</i>.
</li>
<li>They <i>palavered</i> from heaven; the <i>twinkling fakements</i> in their courses <i>palavered</i> against Sisera.
</li>
<li>The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my <i>nishta lucoddy</i>, thou hast <i>minced</i> down <i>butchness</i>.
</li>
<li>Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings, the pransings of their <i>dowry butch</i> ones.
</li>
<li>Curse ye Meroz, <i>cackled</i> the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they <i>trolled</i> not to the help of the <i>Duchess</i>, to the help of the <i>Duchess</i> against the <i>dowry butch</i>.
</li>
<li><i>Fabed</i> above <i>palones</i> shall Jael the <i>palone affair</i> of Heber the Kenite be, <i>fabed</i> shall she be above <i>palones</i> in the <i>trolling lettie</i>.
</li>
<li><i>She</i> asked <i>aqua</i>, and she <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish.
</li>
<li>She put her <i>famble</i> to the nail, and her <i>sweet martini</i> to the workmen&#8217;s hammer; and with the hammer she <i>slapped</i> Sisera, she <i>slapped</i> off <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>, when she had pierced and stricken through <i>her</i> temples.
</li>
<li>At her <i>plates</i> <i>she</i> bowed, <i>she</i> fell, <i>she</i> <i>lett</i> down: at her <i>plates</i> <i>she</i> bowed, <i>she</i> fell: where <i>she</i> bowed, there <i>she</i> fell down <i>stiff</i>.
</li>
<li>The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and <i>screeched</i> through the lattice, Why is <i>her</i> <i>trundling cheat</i> so long in <i>trolling</i>? why tarry the wheels of <i>her</i> <i>rattling coves</i>?
</li>
<li>Her wise ladies answered her, <i>any road up</i>, she <i>trolled back</i> answer to herself,
</li>
<li>Have they not sped? have they not <i>medzered</i> the prey; to every <i>homie</i> a damsel or <i>dewey</i>; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers colours of needlework on both sides, meet for the necks of them that <i>lell</i> the spoil?
</li>
<li>So let all thine enemies perish, O <i>Duchess</i>: but let them that love <i>her</i> be as the sun when <i>she</i> goeth forth in <i>her</i> might. And the land had <i>lettie</i> <i>quarter dacha</i> years.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Chapter 6</h2>
<ol>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel did <i>nana</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>: and the <i>Duchess</i> <i>laued</i> them into the <i>famble</i> of Midian <i>setter</i> years.
</li>
<li>And the <i>famble</i> of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the Midianites the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and caves, and <i>butch</i> holds.
</li>
<li>And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites <i>trolled</i> up, and the Amalekites, and the <i>chavvies</i> of the east, even they <i>trolled</i> up against them;
</li>
<li>And they encamped against them, and <i>battyfanged</i> the increase of the earth, till thou <i>troll</i> unto Gaza, and <i>dry</i> no sustenance for Israel, <i>nishta</i> sheep, <i>nishta</i> ox, <i>nishta</i> ass.
</li>
<li>For they <i>trolled</i> up with their cattle and their <i>trolling letties</i>, and they <i>trolled</i> as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were <i>nanti</i> number: and they entered into the land to <i>battyfang</i> it.
</li>
<li>And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>screeched</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i>, when the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>screeched</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i> because of the Midianites,
</li>
<li>That the <i>Duchess</i> <i>laued</i> a prophet unto the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, which <i>cackled</i> unto them, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the <i>lattie</i> of bondage;
</li>
<li>And I <i>laued</i> you out of the <i>famble</i> of the Egyptians, and out of the <i>famble</i> of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from before you, and <i>parkered</i> you their land;
</li>
<li>And I <i>cackled</i> unto you, I am the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i>; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye <i>lett</i>: but ye have not obeyed my <i>cackling fakement</i>.
</li>
<li>And there <i>trolled</i> an <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite: and <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites.
</li>
<li>And the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> appeared unto <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, The <i>Duchess</i> is with thee, thou <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homie</i> of valour.
</li>
<li>And Gideon <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Oh my <i>Duchess</i>, if the <i>Duchess</i> be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where be all <i>her</i> miracles which our <i>aunties</i> <i>cackled</i> us of, <i>cackling</i>, Did not the <i>Duchess</i> <i>parker</i> us up from Egypt? but now the <i>Duchess</i> hath forsaken us, and <i>laued</i> us into the <i>fambles</i> of the Midianites.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> looked upon <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>troll</i> in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the <i>famble</i> of the Midianites: have not I <i>laued</i> thee?
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Oh my <i>Duchess</i>, wherewith shall I save Israel? <i>varda</i>, my family is <i>nanti dinarly</i> in Manasseh, and I am the <i>nanti dowriest</i> in my <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt <i>slap</i> the Midianites as <i>una</i> <i>homie</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, If now I have found <i>gracie</i> in thy <i>vardaing</i>, then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me.
</li>
<li><i>Troll off</i> not hence, I pray thee, until I <i>troll</i> unto thee, and <i>parker</i> forth my present, and set it before thee. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, I will tarry until thou <i>troll</i> again.
</li>
<li>And Gideon <i>trolled</i> in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh <i>she</i> put in a basket, and <i>she</i> put the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto <i>her</i> under the oak, and presented it.
</li>
<li>And the <i>fairy</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>lell</i> the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and <i>lett</i> them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And <i>she</i> did so.
</li>
<li>Then the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> put forth the end of the <i>trolling fakement</i> that was in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>, and <i>reefed</i> the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up <i>binco fakement</i> out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled off</i> out of <i>her</i> <i>vardaing</i>.
</li>
<li>And when Gideon perceived that <i>she</i> was an <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, Gideon <i>cackled</i>, Alas, O <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>! for because I have <i>vardad</i> an <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>eke</i> to <i>eke</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Peace be unto thee; fear not: <i>nishta</i> <i>cark it</i>.
</li>
<li>Then Gideon built an <i>grovelling fakement</i> there unto the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>screeched</i> it Jehovahshalom: unto this <i>journo</i> it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i> the same <i>nochy</i>, that the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>lell</i> thy <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s <i>bean</i> bullock, even the second bullock of <i>setter</i> years <i>badge</i>, and throw down the <i>grovelling fakement</i> of Baal that thy <i>Auntie</i> hath, and cut down the grove that is by it:
</li>
<li>And build an <i>grovelling fakement</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and <i>lell</i> the second bullock, and offer a burnt <i>parker</i> with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down.
</li>
<li>Then Gideon <i>lelled</i> <i>dacha</i> <i>homies</i> of <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>, and did as the <i>Duchess</i> had <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>: and so it was, because <i>she</i> feared <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s household, and the <i>homies</i> of the <i>smoke</i>, that <i>she</i> could not do it by <i>journo</i>, that <i>she</i> did it by <i>nochy</i>.
</li>
<li>And when the <i>homies</i> of the <i>smoke</i> arose early in the morning, <i>varda</i>, the <i>grovelling fakement</i> of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the <i>grovelling fakement</i> that was built.
</li>
<li>And they <i>cackled</i> <i>una</i> to another, Who hath done this <i>fakement</i>? And when they enquired and asked, they <i>cackled</i>, Gideon the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Joash hath done this <i>fakement</i>.
</li>
<li>Then the <i>homies</i> of the <i>smoke</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Joash, <i>parker</i> out thy <i>homie chavvie</i>, that <i>she</i> may <i>cark it</i>: because <i>she</i> hath cast down the <i>grovelling fakement</i> of Baal, and because <i>she</i> hath cut down the grove that was by it.
</li>
<li>And Joash <i>cackled</i> unto all that stood against <i>her</i>, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save <i>her</i>? <i>she</i> that will plead for <i>her</i>, let <i>her</i> be put to <i>carking it</i> whilst it is yet morning: if <i>she</i> be a <i>Gloria</i>, let <i>her</i> plead for himself, because <i>una</i> hath cast down <i>her</i> <i>grovelling fakement</i>.
</li>
<li>Therefore on that <i>journo</i> <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> <i>her</i> Jerubbaal, <i>cackling</i>, Let Baal plead against <i>her</i>, because <i>she</i> hath thrown down <i>her</i> <i>grovelling fakement</i>.
</li>
<li>Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the <i>chavvies</i> of the east were gathered together, and <i>trolled</i> over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel.
</li>
<li>But the <i>Fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> upon Gideon, and <i>she</i> blew a <i>tooting fakement</i>; and Abiezer was gathered after <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after <i>her</i>: and <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they <i>trolled</i> up to meet them.
</li>
<li>And Gideon <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Gloria</i>, If thou wilt save Israel by mine <i>famble</i>, as thou hast <i>cackled</i>,
</li>
<li><i>Varda</i>, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine <i>famble</i>, as thou hast <i>cackled</i>.
</li>
<li>And it was so: for <i>she</i> rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of <i>aqua</i>.
</li>
<li>And Gideon <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Gloria</i>, Let not thine <i>wild</i> be hot against me, and I will <i>cackle</i> but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> did so that <i>nochy</i>: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Chapter 7</h2>
<ol>
<li>Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the <i>homies and palones</i> that were with <i>her</i>, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Gideon, The <i>homies and palones</i> that are with thee are too many for me to <i>parker</i> the Midianites into their <i>fambles</i>, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, <i>cackling</i>, Mine own <i>famble</i> hath saved me.
</li>
<li>Now therefore <i>troll</i> to, proclaim in the <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let <i>her</i> return and <i>troll off</i> early from mount Gilead. And there <i>trolled back</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>dewey dacha</i> and <i>dewey</i> <i>mille</i>; and there remained <i>dacha</i> <i>mille</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Gideon, The <i>homies and palones</i> are yet too many; <i>parker</i> them down unto the <i>aqua</i>, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I <i>cackle</i> unto thee, This shall <i>troll</i> with thee, the same shall <i>troll</i> with thee; and of whomsoever I <i>cackle</i> unto thee, This shall not <i>troll</i> with thee, the same shall not <i>troll</i>.
</li>
<li>So <i>she</i> brought down the <i>homies and palones</i> unto the <i>aqua</i>: and the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Gideon, Every <i>una</i> that lappeth of the <i>aqua</i> with <i>her</i> <i>polari</i>, as a <i>girl with a lovely personality</i> lappeth, <i>her</i> shalt thou set by himself; likewise every <i>una</i> that boweth down upon <i>her</i> knees to <i>buvare</i>.
</li>
<li>And the number of them that lapped, putting their <i>famble</i> to their <i>screech</i>, were <i>trey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>homies</i>: but all the <i>lettie</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i> bowed down upon their knees to <i>buvare</i> <i>aqua</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Gideon, By the <i>trey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>homies</i> that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine <i>famble</i>: and let all the other <i>homies and palones</i> <i>troll</i> every <i>homie</i> unto <i>her</i> place.
</li>
<li>So the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>lelled</i> victuals in their <i>famble</i>, and their trumpets: and <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> all the <i>lettie</i> of Israel every <i>homie</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>trolling lettie</i>, and retained those <i>trey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>homies</i>: and the host of Midian was beneath <i>her</i> in the valley.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i> the same <i>nochy</i>, that the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have <i>laued</i> it into thine <i>famble</i>.
</li>
<li>But if thou fear to <i>troll</i> down, <i>troll</i> thou with Phurah thy <i>serving homie</i> down to the host:
</li>
<li>And thou shalt <i>aunt nell</i> what they <i>cackle</i>; and afterward shall thine <i>fambles</i> be strengthened to <i>troll</i> down unto the host. Then <i>trolled</i> <i>she</i> down with Phurah <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i> unto the outside of the armed <i>homies</i> that were in the host.
</li>
<li>And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the <i>chavvies</i> of the east <i>lett</i> along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were <i>nanti</i> number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.
</li>
<li>And when Gideon was <i>troll</i>, <i>varda</i>, there was a <i>homie</i> that <i>cackled</i> a dream unto <i>her</i> fellow, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley <i>pannan</i> tumbled into the host of Midian, and <i>trolled</i> unto a <i>trolling lettie</i>, and <i>slapped</i> it that it fell, and overturned it, that the <i>trolling lettie</i> <i>lett</i> along.
</li>
<li>And <i>her</i> fellow answered and <i>cackled</i>, This is <i>nishter</i> else save the <i>dowry efink</i> of Gideon the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Joash, a <i>homie</i> of Israel: for into <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> hath <i>Gloria</i> <i>laued</i> Midian, and all the host.
</li>
<li>And it was so, when Gideon <i>aunt nelled</i> the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that <i>she</i> worshipped, and <i>trolled back</i> into the host of Israel, and <i>cackled</i>, Arise; for the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>laued</i> into your <i>famble</i> the host of Midian.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>medzered</i> the <i>trey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>homies</i> into <i>trey</i> companies, and <i>she</i> put a <i>tooting fakement</i> in every <i>homie</i>&#8216;s <i>famble</i>, with empty pitchers, and <i>bincos</i> within the pitchers.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>varda</i> on me, and do likewise: and, <i>varda</i>, when I <i>troll</i> to the outside of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do.
</li>
<li>When I blow with a <i>tooting fakement</i>, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and <i>cackle</i>, The <i>dowry efink</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and of Gideon.
</li>
<li>So Gideon, and the <i>chenter</i> <i>homies</i> that were with <i>her</i>, <i>trolled</i> unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle <i>varda</i>; and they had but newly set the <i>varda</i>: and they blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers that were in their <i>fambles</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>trey</i> companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the <i>bincos</i> in their <i>dry</i> <i>fambles</i>, and the trumpets in their <i>sweet</i> <i>fambles</i> to blow withal: and they <i>screeched</i>, The <i>dowry efink</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and of Gideon.
</li>
<li>And they stood every <i>homie</i> in <i>her</i> place round about the camp; and all the host ran, and <i>screeched</i>, and fled.
</li>
<li>And the <i>trey</i> <i>chenter</i> blew the trumpets, and the <i>Duchess</i> set every <i>homie</i>&#8216;s <i>dowry efink</i> against <i>her</i> fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the border of Abelmeholah, unto Tabbath.
</li>
<li>And the <i>homies</i> of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites.
</li>
<li>And Gideon <i>laued</i> messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, <i>cackling</i>, <i>troll</i> down against the Midianites, and <i>lell</i> before them the <i>aquas</i> unto Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the <i>homies</i> of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and <i>lelled</i> the <i>aquas</i> unto Bethbarah and Jordan.
</li>
<li>And they <i>lelled</i> <i>dewey</i> <i>princesses</i> of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they <i>ferricadoozaed</i> Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they <i>ferricadoozaed</i> at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the <i>ekes</i> of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Chapter 8</h2>
<ol>
<li>And the <i>homies</i> of Ephraim <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to <i>palaver</i> with the Midianites? And they did chide with <i>her</i> sharply.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim <i>benar</i> than the vintage of Abiezer?
</li>
<li><i>Gloria</i> hath <i>laued</i> into your <i>fambles</i> the <i>princesses</i> of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their <i>wild</i> was abated toward <i>her</i>, when <i>she</i> had <i>cackled</i> that.
</li>
<li>And Gideon <i>trolled</i> to Jordan, and passed over, <i>she</i>, and the <i>trey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>homies</i> that were with <i>her</i>, faint, yet pursuing them.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>homies</i> of Succoth, <i>parker</i>, I pray you, loaves of <i>pannan</i> unto the <i>homies and palones</i> that <i>troll after</i> me; for they be faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, <i>dowriest homies</i> of Midian.
</li>
<li>And the <i>princesses</i> of Succoth <i>cackled</i>, Are the <i>fambles</i> of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine <i>famble</i>, that we should <i>parker</i> <i>pannan</i> unto thine army?
</li>
<li>And Gideon <i>cackled</i>, Therefore when the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>laued</i> Zebah and Zalmunna into mine <i>famble</i>, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the <i>nishta smoke</i> and with briers.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> up thence to Penuel, and <i>cackled</i> unto them likewise: and the <i>homies</i> of Penuel answered <i>her</i> as the <i>homies</i> of Succoth had answered <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> also unto the <i>homies</i> of Penuel, <i>cackling</i>, When I <i>troll</i> again in peace, I will break down this tower.
</li>
<li>Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i>, all that were <i>dry</i> of all the hosts of the <i>chavvies</i> of the east: for there fell an <i>chenter</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i> <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i> that drew <i>dowry efink</i>.
</li>
<li>And Gideon <i>trolled</i> up by the way of them that <i>letted</i> in <i>trolling letties</i> on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and <i>slapped</i> the host; for the host was secure.
</li>
<li>And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, <i>she</i> pursued after them, and <i>lelled</i> the <i>dewey</i> <i>dowriest homies</i> of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host.
</li>
<li>And Gideon the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Joash <i>trolled back</i> from battle before the sun was up,
</li>
<li>And caught a <i>bean cove</i> of the <i>homies</i> of Succoth, and enquired of <i>her</i>: and <i>she</i> described unto <i>her</i> the <i>princesses</i> of Succoth, and the <i>fungi</i> thereof, even <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> and seventeen <i>homies</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> unto the <i>homies</i> of Succoth, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i> Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, <i>cackling</i>, Are the <i>fambles</i> of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine <i>famble</i>, that we should <i>parker</i> <i>pannan</i> unto thy <i>homies</i> that are <i>a stretcher case</i>?
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> the <i>fungi</i> of the <i>smoke</i>, and thorns of the <i>nishta smoke</i> and briers, and with them <i>she</i> taught the <i>homies</i> of Succoth.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>zsa zsa-ed</i> down the tower of Penuel, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> the <i>homies</i> of the <i>smoke</i>.
</li>
<li>Then <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i> unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of <i>homies</i> were they whom ye <i>ferricadoozaed</i> at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each <i>una</i> resembled the <i>chavvies</i> of a <i>dowriest homie</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, They were my <i>sisters</i>, even the <i>homie chavvies</i> of my mother: as the <i>Duchess</i> <i>letteth</i>, if ye had saved them alive, I would not <i>ferricadooza</i> you.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Jether <i>her</i> firstborn, Up, and <i>ferricadooza</i> them. But the <i>beandom</i> drew not <i>her</i> <i>dowry efink</i>: for <i>she</i> feared, because <i>she</i> was yet a <i>beandom</i>.
</li>
<li>Then Zebah and Zalmunna <i>cackled</i>, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the <i>homie</i> is, so is <i>her</i> <i>butchness</i>. And Gideon arose, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> Zebah and Zalmunna, and <i>lelled</i> away the ornaments that were on their camels&#8217; necks.
</li>
<li>Then the <i>homies</i> of Israel <i>cackled</i> unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy <i>homie chavvie</i>, and thy <i>homie chavvie</i>&#8216;s <i>homie chavvie</i> also: for thou hast <i>laued</i> us from the <i>famble</i> of Midian.
</li>
<li>And Gideon <i>cackled</i> unto them, I will not rule over you, <i>nishta</i> shall my <i>homie chavvie</i> rule over you: the <i>Duchess</i> shall rule over you.
</li>
<li>And Gideon <i>cackled</i> unto them, I would <i>fancy</i> a request of you, that ye would <i>parker</i> me every <i>homie</i> the <i>aunt nelly fakes</i> of <i>her</i> prey. (For they had golden <i>aunt nelly fakes</i>, because they were Ishmaelites. )
</li>
<li>And they answered, We will willingly <i>parker</i> them. And they spread a <i>frock</i>, and did cast therein every <i>homie</i> the <i>aunt nelly fakes</i> of <i>her</i> prey.
</li>
<li>And the weight of the golden <i>aunt nelly fakes</i> that <i>she</i> requested was a <i>mille</i> and <i>setter</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>medzers</i> of <i>gelt</i>; beside ornaments, and collars, and purple <i>clobber</i> that was on the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels&#8217; necks.
</li>
<li>And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in <i>her</i> <i>smoke</i>, even in Ophrah: and all Israel <i>trolled</i> thither a <i>bitaining</i> after it: which <i>fakement</i> became a snare unto Gideon, and to <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>.
</li>
<li>Thus was Midian subdued before the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, so that they lifted up their <i>ekes</i> <i>nishta</i>. And the country was in quietness <i>quarter dacha</i> years in the days of Gideon.
</li>
<li>And Jerubbaal the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Joash <i>trolled</i> and <i>letted</i> in <i>her</i> own <i>lattie</i>.
</li>
<li>And Gideon had <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> and <i>dacha</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> of <i>her</i> <i>lucoddy</i> begotten: for <i>she</i> had many <i>palone affairs</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>her</i> concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare <i>her</i> a <i>homie chavvie</i>, whose name <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> Abimelech.
</li>
<li>And Gideon the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Joash <i>carked it</i> in a <i>bona</i> <i>badgeness</i>, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i>, as soon as Gideon was <i>stiff</i>, that the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel turned again, and <i>trolled</i> a <i>bitaining</i> after Baalim, and made Baalberith their <i>Gloria</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel remembered not the <i>Duchess</i> their <i>Gloria</i>, who had <i>laued</i> them out of the <i>fambles</i> of all their enemies on every side:
</li>
<li><i>Nishta</i> shewed they kindness to the <i>lattie</i> of Jerubbaal, namely, Gideon, according to all the goodness which <i>she</i> had shewed unto Israel.

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>
<ol>
<li>And Abimelech the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jerubbaal <i>trolled</i> to Shechem unto <i>her</i> mother&#8217;s <i>sisters</i>, and <i>dished the dirt</i> with them, and with all the family of the <i>lattie</i> of <i>her</i> mother&#8217;s <i>Auntie</i>, <i>cackling</i>,
</li>
<li><i>Cackle</i>, I pray you, in the <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> of all the <i>homies</i> of Shechem, Whether is <i>benar</i> for you, either that all the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Jerubbaal, which are <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> and <i>dacha</i> persons, reign over you, or that <i>una</i> reign over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.
</li>
<li>And <i>her</i> mother&#8217;s <i>sisters</i> <i>cackled</i> of <i>her</i> in the <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> of all the <i>homies</i> of Shechem all these <i>lavs</i>: and their <i>thumping cheats</i> inclined to <i>troll after</i> Abimelech; for they <i>cackled</i>, <i>she</i> is our <i>sister</i>.
</li>
<li>And they <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> and <i>dacha</i> pieces of silver out of the <i>lattie</i> of Baalberith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and <i>sparkle</i> persons, which <i>trolled after</i> <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i> at Ophrah, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i> the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Jerubbaal, being <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> and <i>dacha</i> persons, upon <i>una</i> stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jerubbaal was <i>dry</i>; for <i>she</i> hid himself.
</li>
<li>And all the <i>homies</i> of Shechem gathered together, and all the <i>lattie</i> of Millo, and <i>trolled</i>, and made Abimelech <i>dowriest homie</i>, by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.
</li>
<li>And when they <i>cackled</i> it to Jotham, <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up <i>her</i> <i>cackling fakement</i>, and <i>screeched</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>aunt nell</i> unto me, ye <i>homies</i> of Shechem, that <i>Gloria</i> may <i>aunt nell</i> unto you.
</li>
<li>The trees <i>trolled</i> forth on a time to anoint a <i>dowriest homie</i> over them; and they <i>cackled</i> unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us.
</li>
<li>But the olive tree <i>cackled</i> unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour <i>Gloria</i> and <i>homie</i>, and <i>troll</i> to be promoted over the trees?
</li>
<li>And the trees <i>cackled</i> to the fig tree, <i>troll</i> thou, and reign over us.
</li>
<li>But the fig tree <i>cackled</i> unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my <i>bona</i> fruit, and <i>troll</i> to be promoted over the trees?
</li>
<li>Then <i>cackled</i> the trees unto the vine, <i>troll</i> thou, and reign over us.
</li>
<li>And the vine <i>cackled</i> unto them, Should I leave my <i>sherry</i>, which cheereth <i>Gloria</i> and <i>homie</i>, and <i>troll</i> to be promoted over the trees?
</li>
<li>Then <i>cackled</i> all the trees unto the bramble, <i>troll</i> thou, and reign over us.
</li>
<li>And the bramble <i>cackled</i> unto the trees, If <i>no flies</i> ye anoint me <i>dowriest homie</i> over you, then <i>troll</i> and put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let <i>binco fakement</i> <i>troll</i> out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.
</li>
<li>Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye have made Abimelech <i>dowriest homie</i>, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>, and have done unto <i>her</i> according to the deserving of <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i>;
</li>
<li>(For my <i>Auntie</i> <i>palavered</i> for you, and adventured <i>her</i> life far, and <i>laued</i> you out of the <i>famble</i> of Midian:
</li>
<li>And ye are risen up against my <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i> this <i>journo</i>, and have <i>ferricadoozed</i> <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>, <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> and <i>dacha</i> persons, upon <i>una</i> stone, and have made Abimelech, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>her</i> <i>palone servant</i>, <i>dowriest homie</i> over the <i>homies</i> of Shechem, because <i>she</i> is your <i>sister</i>😉
</li>
<li>If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i> this <i>journo</i>, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let <i>her</i> also rejoice in you:
</li>
<li>But if not, let <i>binco fakement</i> <i>troll</i> out from Abimelech, and devour the <i>homies</i> of Shechem, and the <i>lattie</i> of Millo; and let <i>binco fakement</i> <i>troll</i> out from the <i>homies</i> of Shechem, and from the <i>lattie</i> of Millo, and devour Abimelech.
</li>
<li>And Jotham ran away, and fled, and <i>trolled</i> to Beer, and <i>letted</i> there, for fear of Abimelech <i>her</i> <i>sister</i>.
</li>
<li>When Abimelech had reigned <i>trey</i> years over Israel,
</li>
<li>Then <i>Gloria</i> <i>laued</i> an <i>nana</i> <i>Fairy</i> between Abimelech and the <i>homies</i> of Shechem; and the <i>homies</i> of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:
</li>
<li>That the cruelty done to the <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> and <i>dacha</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> of Jerubbaal might <i>troll</i>, and their blood be <i>laued</i> upon Abimelech their <i>sister</i>, which <i>ferricadoozaed</i> them; and upon the <i>homies</i> of Shechem, which aided <i>her</i> in the killing of <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>homies</i> of Shechem set liers in wait for <i>her</i> in the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that <i>trolled</i> along that way by them: and it was <i>cackled</i> Abimelech.
</li>
<li>And Gaal the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ebed <i>trolled</i> with <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, and <i>trolled</i> over to Shechem: and the <i>homies</i> of Shechem put their confidence in <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And they <i>trolled</i> out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and trode the grapes, and made merry, and <i>trolled</i> into the <i>lattie</i> of their <i>Gloria</i>, and did <i>jarry</i> and <i>buvare</i>, and cursed Abimelech.
</li>
<li>And Gaal the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ebed <i>cackled</i>, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve <i>her</i>? is not <i>she</i> the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jerubbaal? and Zebul <i>her</i> officer? serve the <i>homies</i> of Hamor the <i>Auntie</i> of Shechem: for why should we serve <i>her</i>?
</li>
<li>And would to <i>Gloria</i> this <i>homies and palones</i> were under my <i>famble</i>! then would I remove Abimelech. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and <i>troll</i> out.
</li>
<li>And when Zebul the ruler of the <i>smoke</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>lavs</i> of Gaal the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ebed, <i>her</i> <i>wild</i> was kindled.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> messengers unto Abimelech privily, <i>cackling</i>, <i>varda</i>, Gaal the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ebed and <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i> be <i>troll</i> to Shechem; and, <i>varda</i>, they fortify the <i>smoke</i> against thee.
</li>
<li>Now therefore up by <i>nochy</i>, thou and the <i>homies and palones</i> that is with thee, and lie in wait in the field:
</li>
<li>And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon the <i>smoke</i>: and, <i>varda</i>, when <i>she</i> and the <i>homies and palones</i> that is with <i>her</i> <i>troll</i> out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion.
</li>
<li>And Abimelech rose up, and all the <i>homies and palones</i> that were with <i>her</i>, by <i>nochy</i>, and they <i>laued</i> wait against Shechem in <i>quarter</i> companies.
</li>
<li>And Gaal the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ebed <i>trolled</i> out, and stood in the entering of the gate of the <i>smoke</i>: and Abimelech rose up, and the <i>homies and palones</i> that were with <i>her</i>, from lying in wait.
</li>
<li>And when Gaal <i>vardad</i> the <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> to Zebul, <i>varda</i>, there <i>troll</i> <i>homies and palones</i> down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Thou <i>vardest</i> the shadow of the mountains as if they were <i>homies</i>.
</li>
<li>And Gaal <i>cackled</i> again, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i> there <i>troll</i> <i>homies and palones</i> down by the middle of the land, and another company <i>troll</i> along by the plain of Meonenim.
</li>
<li>Then <i>cackled</i> Zebul unto <i>her</i>, Where is now thy <i>screech</i>, wherewith thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve <i>her</i>? is not this the <i>homies and palones</i> that thou hast despised? <i>troll out</i>, I pray now, and <i>palaver</i> with them.
</li>
<li>And Gaal <i>trolled</i> out before the <i>homies</i> of Shechem, and <i>palavered</i> with Abimelech.
</li>
<li>And Abimelech chased <i>her</i>, and <i>she</i> fled before <i>her</i>, and many were overthrown and wounded, even unto the entering of the gate.
</li>
<li>And Abimelech <i>letted</i> at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, that they should not <i>lett</i> in Shechem.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i> on the morrow, that the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>trolled</i> out into the field; and they <i>cackled</i> Abimelech.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> the <i>homies and palones</i>, and <i>medzered</i> them into <i>trey</i> companies, and <i>laued</i> wait in the field, and looked, and, <i>varda</i>, the <i>homies and palones</i> were <i>troll</i> forth out of the <i>smoke</i>; and <i>she</i> rose up against them, and <i>slapped</i> them.
</li>
<li>And Abimelech, and the company that was with <i>her</i>, rushed forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the <i>smoke</i>: and the <i>dewey</i> other companies ran upon all the <i>homies and palones</i> that were in the fields, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> them.
</li>
<li>And Abimelech <i>palavered</i> against the <i>smoke</i> all that <i>journo</i>; and <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> the <i>smoke</i>, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> the <i>homies and palones</i> that was therein, and <i>zsa zsa-ed</i> down the <i>smoke</i>, and sowed it with salt.
</li>
<li>And when all the <i>homies</i> of the tower of Shechem <i>aunt nelled</i> that, they entered into an hold of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Gloria</i> Berith.
</li>
<li>And it was <i>cackled</i> Abimelech, that all the <i>homies</i> of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.
</li>
<li>And Abimelech gat <i>her</i> up to mount Zalmon, <i>she</i> and all the <i>homies and palones</i> that were with <i>her</i>; and Abimelech <i>lelled</i> an axe in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>, and cut down a bough from the trees, and <i>lelled</i> it, and <i>laued</i> it on <i>her</i> shoulder, and <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>homies and palones</i> that were with <i>her</i>, What ye have <i>vardad</i> me do, make haste, and do as I have done.
</li>
<li>And all the <i>homies and palones</i> likewise cut down every <i>homie</i> <i>her</i> bough, and <i>trolled after</i> Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on <i>binco fakement</i> upon them; so that all the <i>homies</i> of the tower of Shechem <i>carked it</i> also, about a <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i> and <i>palones</i>.
</li>
<li>Then <i>trolled</i> Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and <i>lelled</i> it.
</li>
<li>But there was a <i>butch</i> tower within the <i>smoke</i>, and thither fled all the <i>homies</i> and <i>palones</i>, and all they of the <i>smoke</i>, and shut it to them, and gat them up to the top of the tower.
</li>
<li>And Abimelech <i>trolled</i> unto the tower, and <i>palavered</i> against it, and <i>trolled</i> hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with <i>binco fakement</i>.
</li>
<li>And a certain <i>palone</i> cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech&#8217;s <i>eke</i>, and all to brake <i>her</i> skull.
</li>
<li>Then <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> hastily unto the <i>bean cove</i> <i>her</i> armourbearer, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Draw thy <i>dowry efink</i>, and <i>ferricadooza</i> me, that <i>homies</i> <i>cackle</i> not of me, A <i>palones</i> <i>ferricadoozaed</i> <i>her</i>. And <i>her</i> <i>bean cove</i> thrust <i>her</i> through, and <i>she</i> <i>carked it</i>.
</li>
<li>And when the <i>homies</i> of Israel <i>vardad</i> that Abimelech was <i>stiff</i>, they <i>trolled off</i> every <i>homie</i> unto <i>her</i> place.
</li>
<li>Thus <i>Gloria</i> rendered the <i>naffness</i> of Abimelech, which <i>she</i> did unto <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, in slaying <i>her</i> <i>setter dacha</i> <i>sisters</i>:
</li>
<li>And all the <i>nana</i> of the <i>homies</i> of Shechem did <i>Gloria</i> render upon their <i>ekes</i>: and upon them <i>trolled</i> the curse of Jotham the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jerubbaal.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Chapter 10</h2>
<ol>
<li>And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Puah, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Dodo, a <i>homie</i> of Issachar; and <i>she</i> <i>letted</i> in Shamir in mount Ephraim.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> judged Israel <i>dewey dacha</i> and <i>trey</i> years, and <i>carked it</i>, and was buried in Shamir.
</li>
<li>And after <i>her</i> arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel <i>dewey dacha</i> and <i>dewey</i> years.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> had <i>trey dacha</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> that rode on <i>trey dacha</i> ass colts, and they had <i>trey dacha</i> <i>smokes</i>, which are <i>screeched</i> Havothjair unto this <i>journo</i>, which are in the land of Gilead.
</li>
<li>And Jair <i>carked it</i>, and was buried in Camon.
</li>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel did <i>nana</i> again in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon, and the gods of the <i>naffs</i>, and forsook the <i>Duchess</i>, and served not <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>wild</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> was hot against Israel, and <i>she</i> sold them into the <i>fambles</i> of the <i>naffs</i>, and into the <i>fambles</i> of the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon.
</li>
<li>And that year they vexed and oppressed the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel: eighteen years, all the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel that were on the other side Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.
</li>
<li>Moreover the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon passed over Jordan to <i>palaver</i> also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the <i>lattie</i> of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.
</li>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>screeched</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>cackling</i>, We have <i>kertervered</i> against thee, both because we have forsaken our <i>Gloria</i>, and also served Baalim.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon, and from the <i>naffs</i>?
</li>
<li>The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and ye <i>screeched</i> to me, and I <i>laued</i> you out of their <i>famble</i>.
</li>
<li>Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will deliver you <i>nishta</i>.
</li>
<li><i>Troll</i> and <i>screech</i> unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation.
</li>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>, We have <i>kertervered</i>: do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth <i>bona</i> unto thee; deliver us only, we pray thee, this <i>journo</i>.
</li>
<li>And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the <i>Duchess</i>: and <i>her</i> <i>nishta lucoddy</i> was grieved for the misery of Israel.
</li>
<li>Then the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpeh.
</li>
<li>And the <i>homies and palones</i> and <i>princesses</i> of Gilead <i>cackled</i> <i>una</i> to another, What <i>homie</i> is <i>she</i> that will begin to <i>palaver</i> against the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon? <i>she</i> shall be <i>eke</i> over all the inhabitants of Gilead.

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>
<ol>
<li>Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homie</i> of valour, and <i>she</i> was the <i>homie chavvie</i> of an <i>charvering donna</i>: and Gilead <i>chavvied</i> Jephthah.
</li>
<li>And Gilead&#8217;s <i>palone affair</i> bare <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>; and <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>&#8216;s <i>homie chavvies</i> grew up, and they thrust out Jephthah, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>nishta</i> inherit in our <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>; for thou art the <i>homie chavvie</i> of a strange <i>palone</i>.
</li>
<li>Then Jephthah fled from <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, and <i>letted</i> in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain <i>homies</i> to Jephthah, and <i>trolled</i> out with <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i> in process of time, that the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon made <i>barney</i> against Israel.
</li>
<li>And it was so, that when the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon made <i>barney</i> against Israel, the <i>fungi</i> of Gilead <i>trolled</i> to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob:
</li>
<li>And they <i>cackled</i> unto Jephthah, <i>troll</i>, and be our captain, that we may <i>palaver</i> with the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon.
</li>
<li>And Jephthah <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>fungi</i> of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and expel me out of my <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>? and why are ye <i>troll</i> unto me now when ye are in distress?
</li>
<li>And the <i>fungi</i> of Gilead <i>cackled</i> unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to thee now, that thou mayest <i>troll</i> with us, and <i>palaver</i> against the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon, and be our <i>eke</i> over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
</li>
<li>And Jephthah <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>fungi</i> of Gilead, If ye <i>parker</i> me home again to <i>palaver</i> against the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon, and the <i>Duchess</i> deliver them before me, shall I be your <i>eke</i>?
</li>
<li>And the <i>fungi</i> of Gilead <i>cackled</i> unto Jephthah, The <i>Duchess</i> be <i>varda-ing fakement</i> between us, if we <i>nix</i> so according to thy <i>lavs</i>.
</li>
<li>Then Jephthah <i>trolled</i> with the <i>fungi</i> of Gilead, and the <i>homies and palones</i> made <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all <i>her</i> <i>lavs</i> before the <i>Duchess</i> in Mizpeh.
</li>
<li>And Jephthah <i>laued</i> messengers unto the <i>dowriest homie</i> of the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon, <i>cackling</i>, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art <i>troll</i> against me to <i>palaver</i> in my land?
</li>
<li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel <i>lelled</i> away my land, when they <i>trolled</i> up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and unto Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again peaceably.
</li>
<li>And Jephthah <i>laued</i> messengers again unto the <i>dowriest homie</i> of the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon:
</li>
<li>And <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> Jephthah, Israel <i>lelled</i> not away the land of Moab, <i>nishta</i> the land of the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon:
</li>
<li>But when Israel <i>trolled</i> up from Egypt, and <i>minced</i> through the <i>nishta smoke</i> unto the Red sea, and <i>trolled</i> to Kadesh;
</li>
<li>Then Israel <i>laued</i> messengers unto the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Edom, <i>cackling</i>, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Edom would not <i>aunt nell</i> thereto. And in like manner they <i>laued</i> unto the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Moab: but <i>she</i> would not consent: and Israel <i>letted</i> in Kadesh.
</li>
<li>Then they <i>trolled</i> along through the <i>nishta smoke</i>, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and <i>trolled</i> by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but <i>trolled</i> not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab.
</li>
<li>And Israel <i>laued</i> messengers unto Sihon <i>dowriest homie</i> of the Amorites, the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Heshbon; and Israel <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land into my place.
</li>
<li>But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through <i>her</i> coast: but Sihon gathered all <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i> together, and pitched in Jahaz, and <i>palavered</i> against Israel.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel <i>laued</i> Sihon and all <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i> into the <i>famble</i> of Israel, and they <i>slapped</i> them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.
</li>
<li>And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and from the <i>nishta smoke</i> even unto Jordan.
</li>
<li>So now the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i> Israel, and shouldest thou possess it?
</li>
<li>Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy <i>Gloria</i> giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i> shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.
</li>
<li>And now art thou any <i>fakement</i> <i>benar</i> than Balak the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Zippor, <i>dowriest homie</i> of Moab? did <i>she</i> ever strive against Israel, or did <i>she</i> ever <i>palaver</i> against them,
</li>
<li>While Israel <i>letted</i> in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the <i>smokes</i> that be along by the coasts of Arnon, <i>trey</i> <i>chenter</i> years? why therefore did ye not recover them within that time?
</li>
<li>Wherefore I have not <i>kertervered</i> against thee, but thou doest me wrong to <i>barney</i> against me: the <i>Duchess</i> the <i>beak</i> be <i>beak</i> this <i>journo</i> between the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel and the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon.
</li>
<li>Howbeit the <i>dowriest homie</i> of the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon <i>aunt nelled</i> not unto the <i>lavs</i> of Jephthah which <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>Then the <i>Fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> upon Jephthah, and <i>she</i> passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead <i>she</i> passed over unto the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon.
</li>
<li>And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, If thou shalt <i>nanti</i> fail deliver the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon into mine <i>fambles</i>,
</li>
<li>Then it shall be, that whatsoever <i>trolleth</i> forth of the doors of my <i>lattie</i> to meet me, when I return in peace from the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon, shall surely be the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s, and I will offer it up for a burnt <i>parkering</i>.
</li>
<li>So Jephthah passed over unto the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon to <i>palaver</i> against them; and the <i>Duchess</i> <i>laued</i> them into <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>slapped</i> them from Aroer, even till thou <i>troll</i> to Minnith, even <i>dewey dacha</i> <i>smokes</i>, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry</i> slaughter. Thus the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon were subdued before the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel.
</li>
<li>And Jephthah <i>trolled</i> to Mizpeh unto <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>, and, <i>varda</i>, <i>her</i> <i>palone chavvie</i> <i>trolled</i> out to meet <i>her</i> with timbrels and with dances: and she was <i>her</i> only <i>chavvie</i>; beside her <i>she</i> had <i>nishta</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> <i>nishta</i> <i>palone chavvie</i>.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i>, when <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> her, that <i>she</i> rent <i>her</i> <i>zhoosh</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Alas, my <i>palone chavvie</i>! thou hast brought me <i>dowry</i> low, and thou art <i>una</i> of them that trouble me: for I have opened my <i>screech</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>, and I cannot <i>troll</i> back.
</li>
<li>And she <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, My <i>Auntie</i>, if thou hast opened thy <i>screech</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy <i>screech</i>; forasmuch as the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>lelled</i> <i>the rights</i> for thee of thine enemies, even of the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon.
</li>
<li>And she <i>cackled</i> unto her <i>Auntie</i>, Let this <i>fakement</i> be done for me: let me alone <i>dewey</i> months, that I may <i>troll</i> up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>troll</i>. And <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> her away for <i>dewey</i> months: and she <i>trolled</i> with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i> at the end of <i>dewey</i> months, that she <i>trolled back</i> unto her <i>Auntie</i>, who did with her according to <i>her</i> vow which <i>she</i> had vowed: and she knew no <i>homie</i>. And it was a custom in Israel,
</li>
<li>That the <i>palone chavvies</i> of Israel <i>trolled</i> yearly to lament the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Jephthah the Gileadite <i>quarter</i> days in a year.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Chapter 12</h2>
<ol>
<li>And the <i>homies</i> of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and <i>trolled</i> northward, and <i>cackled</i> unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to <i>palaver</i> against the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon, and didst not <i>screech</i> us to <i>troll</i> with thee? we will burn thine <i>lattie</i> upon thee with <i>binco fakement</i>.
</li>
<li>And Jephthah <i>cackled</i> unto them, I and my <i>homies and palones</i> were at <i>dowry</i> strife with the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon; and when I <i>screeched</i> you, ye <i>laued</i> me not out of their <i>fambles</i>.
</li>
<li>And when I <i>vardad</i> that ye <i>laued</i> me not, I put my life in my <i>fambles</i>, and passed over against the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon, and the <i>Duchess</i> <i>laued</i> them into my <i>famble</i>: wherefore then are ye <i>troll</i> up unto me this <i>journo</i>, to <i>palaver</i> against me?
</li>
<li>Then Jephthah gathered together all the <i>homies</i> of Gilead, and <i>palavered</i> with Ephraim: and the <i>homies</i> of Gilead <i>slapped</i> Ephraim, because they <i>cackled</i>, Ye Gileadites are <i>gajos</i> of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites.
</li>
<li>And the Gileadites <i>lelled</i> the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were <i>scarpered</i> <i>cackled</i>, Let me <i>troll</i> over; that the <i>homies</i> of Gilead <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Art thou an Ephraimite? If <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Nay;
</li>
<li>Then <i>cackled</i> they unto <i>her</i>, <i>cackle</i> now Shibboleth: and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> Sibboleth: for <i>she</i> could not frame to pronounce it <i>sweet</i>. Then they <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i>, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> <i>her</i> at the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites <i>quarter dacha</i> and <i>dewey</i> <i>mille</i>.
</li>
<li>And Jephthah judged Israel <i>sey</i> years. Then <i>carked it</i> Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in <i>una</i> of the <i>smokes</i> of Gilead.
</li>
<li>And after <i>her</i> Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> had <i>trey dacha</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>, and <i>trey dacha</i> <i>palone chavvies</i>, whom <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> abroad, and <i>lelled</i> in <i>trey dacha</i> <i>palone chavvies</i> from abroad for <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>. And <i>she</i> judged Israel <i>setter</i> years.
</li>
<li>Then <i>carked it</i> Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem.
</li>
<li>And after <i>her</i> Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and <i>she</i> judged Israel <i>dacha</i> years.
</li>
<li>And Elon the Zebulonite <i>carked it</i>, and was buried in Aijalon in the country of Zebulun.
</li>
<li>And after <i>her</i> Abdon the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged Israel.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> had <i>quarter dacha</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> and <i>trey dacha</i> nephews, that rode on <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> and <i>dacha</i> ass colts: and <i>she</i> judged Israel <i>say dooe</i> years.
</li>
<li>And Abdon the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Hillel the Pirathonite <i>carked it</i>, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites.

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>
<ol>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel did <i>nana</i> again in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>; and the <i>Duchess</i> <i>laued</i> them into the <i>famble</i> of the <i>naffs</i> <i>quarter dacha</i> years.
</li>
<li>And there was a certain <i>homie</i> of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i> was barren, and bare not.
</li>
<li>And the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> appeared unto the <i>palone</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto her, <i>varda</i> now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a <i>homie chavvie</i>.
</li>
<li>Now therefore <i>gardy loo</i>, I pray thee, and <i>buvare</i> not <i>sherry</i> <i>nishta</i> <i>butch</i> <i>buvare</i>, and <i>jarry</i> not any <i>nanti sparkle</i> <i>fakement</i>:
</li>
<li>For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a <i>homie chavvie</i>; and no <i>fatcha fakement</i> shall <i>troll</i> on <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>: for the <i>chavvie</i> shall be a Nazarite unto <i>Gloria</i> from the womb: and <i>she</i> shall begin to deliver Israel out of the <i>famble</i> of the <i>naffs</i>.
</li>
<li>Then the <i>palone</i> <i>trolled</i> and <i>cackled</i> her <i>homie affair</i>, <i>cackling</i>, A <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>trolled</i> unto me, and <i>her</i> countenance was like the countenance of an <i>fairy</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, <i>dowry</i> <i>nanna</i>: but I asked <i>her</i> not whence <i>she</i> was, <i>nishta</i> <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i> me <i>her</i> name:
</li>
<li>But <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, <i>varda</i>, thou shalt conceive, and bear a <i>homie chavvie</i>; and now <i>buvare</i> no <i>sherry</i> <i>nishta</i> <i>butch</i> <i>buvare</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>jarry</i> any <i>nanti sparkle</i> <i>fakement</i>: for the <i>chavvie</i> shall be a Nazarite to <i>Gloria</i> from the womb to the <i>journo</i> of <i>her</i> <i>carking it</i>.
</li>
<li>Then Manoah intreated the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, O my <i>Duchess</i>, let the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> which thou didst <i>lau</i> <i>troll</i> again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the <i>chavvie</i> that shall be born.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> to the <i>cackling fakement</i> of Manoah; and the <i>fairy</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>trolled</i> again unto the <i>palone</i> as she sat in the field: but Manoah her <i>homie affair</i> was not with her.
</li>
<li>And the <i>palone</i> made haste, and ran, and shewed her <i>homie affair</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>varda</i>, the <i>homie</i> hath appeared unto me, that <i>trolled</i> unto me the other <i>journo</i>.
</li>
<li>And Manoah arose, and <i>trolled</i> after <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>, and <i>trolled</i> to the <i>homie</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Art thou the <i>homie</i> that spakest unto the <i>palone</i>? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, I am.
</li>
<li>And Manoah <i>cackled</i>, Now let thy <i>lavs</i> <i>troll</i> to pass. How shall we order the <i>chavvie</i>, and how shall we do unto <i>her</i>?
</li>
<li>And the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Manoah, Of all that I <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>palone</i> let her <i>gardy loo</i>.
</li>
<li>She may not <i>jarry</i> of any <i>fakement</i> that <i>trolleth</i> of the vine, <i>nishta</i> let her <i>buvare</i> <i>sherry</i> or <i>butch</i> <i>buvare</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>jarry</i> any <i>nanti sparkle</i> <i>fakement</i>: all that I commanded her let her observe.
</li>
<li>And Manoah <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, I pray thee, let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.
</li>
<li>And the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not <i>jarry</i> of thy <i>pannan</i>: and if thou wilt offer a burnt <i>parkering</i>, thou must offer it unto the <i>Duchess</i>. For Manoah knew not that <i>she</i> was an <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
</li>
<li>And Manoah <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, What is thy name, that when thy sayings <i>troll</i> to pass we may do thee honour?
</li>
<li>And the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Why askest thou thus after my name, <i>vardaing</i> it is secret?
</li>
<li>So Manoah <i>lelled</i> a kid with a <i>carnish</i> <i>parkering</i>, and offered it upon a rock unto the <i>Duchess</i>: and the <i>fairy</i> did wonderously; and Manoah and <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i> looked on.
</li>
<li>For it <i>trolled</i> to pass, when the flame <i>trolled</i> up toward heaven from off the <i>grovelling fakement</i>, that the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled up</i> in the flame of the <i>grovelling fakement</i>. And Manoah and <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i> looked on it, and fell on their <i>ekes</i> to the ground.
</li>
<li>But the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> did <i>nishta</i> appear to Manoah and to <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>. Then Manoah knew that <i>she</i> was an <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
</li>
<li>And Manoah <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>, We shall surely <i>cark it</i>, because we have <i>vardad</i> <i>Gloria</i>.
</li>
<li>But <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, If the <i>Duchess</i> were pleased to <i>ferricadoza</i> us, <i>she</i> would not have <i>lalled</i> a burnt <i>parkering</i> and a <i>carnish</i> <i>parkering</i> at our <i>fambles</i>, <i>nishta</i> would <i>she</i> have shewed us all these <i>fakements</i>, <i>nishta</i> would as at this time have <i>cackled</i> us such <i>fakements</i> as these.
</li>
<li>And the <i>palone</i> bare a <i>homie chavvie</i>, and <i>screeched</i> <i>her</i> name Samson: and the <i>chavvie</i> grew, and the <i>Duchess</i> <i>fabed</i> <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> began to <i>troll</i> <i>her</i> at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Chapter 14</h2>
<ol>
<li>And Samson <i>trolled</i> down to Timnath, and <i>vardad</i> a <i>palone</i> in Timnath of the <i>palone chavvies</i> of the <i>naffs</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> up, and <i>cackled</i> <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> and <i>her</i> mother, and <i>cackled</i>, I have <i>vardad</i> a <i>palone</i> in Timnath of the <i>palone chavvies</i> of the <i>naffs</i>: now therefore get her for me to <i>palone affair</i>.
</li>
<li>Then <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> and <i>her</i> mother <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Is there never a <i>palone</i> among the <i>palone chavvies</i> of thy <i>sisters</i>, or among all my <i>homies and palones</i>, that thou <i>trollest</i> to <i>lell</i> a <i>palone affair</i> of the <i>cavalier</i> <i>naffs</i>? And Samson <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.
</li>
<li>But <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> and <i>her</i> mother knew not that it was of the <i>Duchess</i>, that <i>she</i> sought an occasion against the <i>naffs</i>: for at that time the <i>naffs</i> had dominion over Israel.
</li>
<li>Then <i>trolled</i> Samson down, and <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> and <i>her</i> mother, to Timnath, and <i>trolled</i> to the vineyards of Timnath: and, <i>varda</i>, a <i>bean</i> lion roared against <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> mightily upon <i>her</i>, and <i>she</i> rent <i>her</i> as <i>she</i> would have rent a kid, and <i>she</i> had <i>nishter</i> in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>: but <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> not <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> or <i>her</i> mother what <i>she</i> had done.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> down, and talked with the <i>palone</i>; and she pleased Samson well.
</li>
<li>And after a time <i>she</i> <i>trolled back to</i> <i>lell</i> her, and <i>she</i> turned aside to <i>varda</i> the carcase of the lion: and, <i>varda</i>, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> thereof in <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i>, and <i>trolled</i> on eating, and <i>trolled</i> to <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> and mother, and <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> them, and they did <i>jarry</i>: but <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> not them that <i>she</i> had <i>lelled</i> the honey out of the carcase of the lion.
</li>
<li>So <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> <i>trolled</i> down unto the <i>palone</i>: and Samson made there a <i>dowry munjarlee</i>; for so used the <i>bean coves</i> to do.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i>, when they <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i>, that they brought <i>trey dacha</i> companions to be with <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And Samson <i>cackled</i> unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can <i>mais oui</i> <i>screech</i> it me within the <i>setter</i> days of the <i>dowry munjarlee</i>, and find it out, then I will <i>parker</i> you <i>trey dacha</i> sheets and <i>trey dacha</i> change of <i>frocks</i>:
</li>
<li>But if ye cannot <i>screech</i> it me, then shall ye <i>parker</i> me <i>trey dacha</i> sheets and <i>trey dacha</i> change of <i>frocks</i>. And they <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Put forth thy riddle, that we may <i>aunt nell</i> it.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Out of the eater <i>trolled</i> forth <i>carnish</i>, and out of the <i>butch</i> <i>trolled</i> forth sweetness. And they could not in <i>trey</i> days expound the riddle.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i> on the <i>setterth</i> <i>journo</i>, that they <i>cackled</i> unto Samson&#8217;s <i>palone affair</i>, Entice thy <i>homie affair</i>, that <i>she</i> may <i>screech</i> unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i> with <i>binco fakement</i>: have ye <i>screeched</i> us to <i>lell</i> that we have? is it not so?
</li>
<li>And Samson&#8217;s <i>palone affair</i> <i>parnied</i> before <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the <i>chavvies</i> of my <i>homies and palones</i>, and hast not <i>cackled</i> it me. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto her, <i>varda</i>, I have not <i>cackled</i> it my <i>Auntie</i> <i>nishta</i> my mother, and shall I <i>cackle</i> it thee?
</li>
<li>And she <i>parnied</i> before <i>her</i> the <i>setter</i> days, while their <i>dowry munjarlee</i> lasted: <i>any road up</i> on the <i>setterth</i> <i>journo</i>, that <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> her, because she <i>lett</i> sore upon <i>her</i>: and she <i>cackled</i> the riddle to the <i>chavvies</i> of her <i>homies and palones</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>homies</i> of the <i>smoke</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> on the <i>setterth</i> <i>journo</i> before the sun <i>trolled</i> down, What is sweeter than honey? And what is <i>butcher</i> than a lion? and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> upon <i>her</i>, and <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> down to Ashkelon, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> <i>trey dacha</i> <i>homies</i> of them, and <i>lelled</i> their spoil, and <i>parkered</i> change of <i>frocks</i> unto them which expounded the riddle. And <i>her</i> <i>wild</i> was kindled, and <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> up to <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>.
</li>
<li>But Samson&#8217;s <i>palone affair</i> was <i>parkered</i> to <i>her</i> companion, whom <i>she</i> had used as <i>her</i> <i>bencove</i>.

</ol>
<h2>Chapter 15</h2>
<ol>
<li>But it <i>trolled</i> to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i> with a kid; and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, I will <i>troll</i> in to my <i>palone affair</i> into the <i>booth</i>. But her <i>Auntie</i> would not suffer <i>her</i> to <i>troll</i> in.
</li>
<li>And her <i>Auntie</i> <i>cackled</i>, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I <i>parkered</i> her to thy companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? <i>lell</i> her, I pray thee, instead of her.
</li>
<li>And Samson <i>cackled</i> concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the <i>naffs</i>, though I do them a displeasure.
</li>
<li>And Samson <i>trolled</i> and caught <i>trey</i> <i>chenter</i> foxes, and <i>lelled</i> firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between <i>dewey</i> tails.
</li>
<li>And when <i>she</i> had set the brands on <i>binco fakement</i>, <i>she</i> let them <i>troll</i> into the standing corn of the <i>naffs</i>, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives.
</li>
<li>Then the <i>naffs</i> <i>cackled</i>, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson, the <i>homie chavvie</i> in law of the Timnite, because <i>she</i> had <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>, and <i>parkered</i> her to <i>her</i> companion. And the <i>naffs</i> <i>trolled</i> up, and burnt her and her <i>Auntie</i> with <i>binco fakement</i>.
</li>
<li>And Samson <i>cackled</i> unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>slapped</i> them hip and thigh with a <i>dowry</i> slaughter: and <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> down and <i>letted</i> in the top of the rock Etam.
</li>
<li>Then the <i>naffs</i> <i>trolled</i> up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.
</li>
<li>And the <i>homies</i> of Judah <i>cackled</i>, Why are ye <i>troll</i> up against us? And they answered, To bind Samson are we <i>troll</i> up, to do to <i>her</i> as <i>she</i> hath done to us.
</li>
<li>Then <i>trey</i> <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i> of Judah <i>trolled</i> to the top of the rock Etam, and <i>cackled</i> to Samson, Knowest thou not that the <i>naffs</i> are rulers over us? what is this that thou hast done unto us? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.
</li>
<li>And they <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, We are <i>troll</i> down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the <i>famble</i> of the <i>naffs</i>. And Samson <i>cackled</i> unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.
</li>
<li>And they <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, No; but we will bind thee <i>nishta manjarry</i>, and deliver thee into their <i>famble</i>: but surely we will not <i>ferricadoza</i> thee. And they bound <i>her</i> with <i>dewey</i> new cords, and brought <i>her</i> up from the rock.
</li>
<li>And when <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> unto Lehi, the <i>naffs</i> shouted against <i>her</i>: and the <i>Fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> mightily upon <i>her</i>, and the cords that were upon <i>her</i> arms became as flax that was burnt with <i>binco fakement</i>, and <i>her</i> bands loosed from off <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>, and <i>lelled</i> it, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> a <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i> therewith.
</li>
<li>And Samson <i>cackled</i>, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I <i>ferricadoozed</i> a <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i>.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i>, when <i>she</i> had made an end of speaking, that <i>she</i> cast away the jawbone out of <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>, and <i>screeched</i> that place Ramathlehi.

<li>And <i>she</i> was sore athirst, and <i>screeched</i> on the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Thou hast <i>parkered</i> this <i>dowry</i> deliverance into the <i>famble</i> of thy <i>serving homie</i>: and now shall I <i>cark it</i> for thirst, and fall into the <i>famble</i> of the <i>cavalier</i>?
</li>
<li>But <i>Gloria</i> clave an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there <i>trolled</i> <i>aqua</i> thereout; and when <i>she</i> had <i>bevvied</i>, <i>her</i> <i>Fairy</i> <i>trolled</i> again, and <i>she</i> revived: wherefore <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> the name thereof Enhakkore, which is in Lehi unto this <i>journo</i>.

<li>And Samson <i>lett</i> till midnight, and arose at midnight, and <i>lelled</i> the doors of the gate of the <i>smoke</i>, and the <i>dewey</i> posts, and <i>trolled</i> away with them, bar and all, and put them upon <i>her</i> shoulders, and <i>lelled</i> them up to the top of an hill that is before Hebron.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i> afterward, that <i>she</i> loved a <i>palone</i> in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.
</li>
<li>And the <i>ladies</i> of the <i>naffs</i> <i>trolled</i> up unto her, and <i>cackled</i> unto her, Entice <i>her</i>, and <i>varda</i> wherein <i>her</i> <i>dowry</i> <i>butchness</i> <i>lettieth</i>, and by what means we may prevail against <i>her</i>, that we may bind <i>her</i> to afflict <i>her</i>; and we will <i>parker</i> thee every <i>una</i> of us <i>long dedger</i> <i>chenter</i> pieces of silver.
</li>
<li>And Delilah <i>cackled</i> to Samson, <i>cackle</i> me, I pray thee, wherein thy <i>dowry</i> <i>butchness</i> <i>lettieth</i>, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee.
</li>
<li>And Samson <i>cackled</i> unto her, If they bind me with <i>setter</i> green withs that were never dried, then shall I be <i>nelly</i>, and be as another <i>homie</i>.
</li>
<li>Then the <i>ladies</i> of the <i>naffs</i> brought up to her <i>setter</i> green withs which had not been dried, and she bound <i>her</i> with them.
</li>
<li>Now there were <i>homies</i> lying in wait, <i>letting</i> with her in the <i>booth</i>. And she <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, The <i>naffs</i> be upon thee, Samson. And <i>she</i> brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it <i>reefeth</i> the <i>binco fakement</i>. So <i>her</i> <i>butchness</i> was not known.
</li>
<li>And Delilah <i>cackled</i> unto Samson, <i>varda</i>, thou hast mocked me, and <i>cackled</i> me lies: now <i>cackle</i> me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto her, If they bind me <i>nishta manjarry</i> with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be <i>nelly</i>, and be as another <i>homie</i>.
</li>
<li>Delilah therefore <i>lelled</i> new ropes, and bound <i>her</i> therewith, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, The <i>naffs</i> be upon thee, Samson. And there were liers in wait <i>letting</i> in the <i>booth</i>. And <i>she</i> brake them from off <i>her</i> arms like a thread.
</li>
<li>And Delilah <i>cackled</i> unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and <i>cackled</i> me lies: <i>cackle</i> me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto her, If thou weavest the <i>setter</i> locks of my <i>eke</i> with the web.
</li>
<li>And she fastened it with the pin, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, The <i>naffs</i> be upon thee, Samson. And <i>she</i> awaked out of <i>her</i> <i>letty</i>, and <i>trolled</i> away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.
</li>
<li>And she <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, How canst thou <i>cackle</i>, I love thee, when thine <i>thumping cheat</i> is not with me? thou hast mocked me these <i>trey</i> times, and hast not <i>cackled</i> me wherein thy <i>dowry</i> <i>butchness</i> <i>lettieth</i>.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i>, when she pressed <i>her</i> daily with her <i>lavs</i>, and urged <i>her</i>, so that <i>her</i> <i>nishta lucoddy</i> was vexed unto <i>carking it</i>;
</li>
<li>That <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> her all <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto her, There hath not <i>troll</i> a <i>fatcha fakement</i> upon mine <i>eke</i>; for I have been a Nazarite unto <i>Gloria</i> from my mother&#8217;s womb: if I be shaven, then my <i>butchness</i> will <i>troll</i> from me, and I shall become <i>nelly</i>, and be like any other <i>homie</i>.
</li>
<li>And when Delilah <i>vardad</i> that <i>she</i> had <i>cackled</i> her all <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>, she <i>laued</i> and <i>screeched</i> for the <i>ladies</i> of the <i>naffs</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>troll</i> up this once, for <i>she</i> hath shewed me all <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>. Then the <i>ladies</i> of the <i>naffs</i> <i>trolled</i> up unto her, and brought <i>dinarly</i> in their <i>famble</i>.
</li>
<li>And she made <i>her</i> <i>letty</i> upon her knees; and she <i>screeched</i> for a <i>homie</i>, and she caused <i>her</i> to <i>fatcha</i> off the <i>setter</i> locks of <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>; and she began to afflict <i>her</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>butchness</i> <i>trolled</i> from <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And she <i>cackled</i>, The <i>naffs</i> be upon thee, Samson. And <i>she</i> awoke out of <i>her</i> <i>letty</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, I will <i>troll out</i> as at other times before, and shake myself. And <i>she</i> wist not that the <i>Duchess</i> was <i>trolled off</i> from <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>But the <i>naffs</i> <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i>, and put out <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i>, and brought <i>her</i> down to Gaza, and bound <i>her</i> with fetters of brass; and <i>she</i> did grind in the <i>charpering carsey</i> <i>lattie</i>.
</li>
<li>Howbeit the <i>riah</i> of <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> began to grow again after <i>she</i> was shaven.
</li>
<li>Then the <i>ladies</i> of the <i>naffs</i> gathered them together for to offer a <i>dowry</i> <i>parker</i> unto Dagon their <i>Gloria</i>, and to rejoice: for they <i>cackled</i>, Our <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>laued</i> Samson our enemy into our <i>famble</i>.
</li>
<li>And when the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i>, they praised their <i>Gloria</i>: for they <i>cackled</i>, Our <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>laued</i> into our <i>fambles</i> our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which <i>ferricadoozaed</i> many of us.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i>, when their <i>thumping cheats</i> were merry, that they <i>cackled</i>, <i>screech</i> for Samson, that <i>she</i> may make us sport. And they <i>screeched</i> for Samson out of the <i>charpering carsey</i> <i>lattie</i>; and <i>she</i> made them sport: and they set <i>her</i> between the pillars.
</li>
<li>And Samson <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>bean cove</i> that held <i>her</i> by the <i>famble</i>, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the <i>lattie</i> standeth, that I may lean upon them.
</li>
<li>Now the <i>lattie</i> was full of <i>homies</i> and <i>palones</i>; and all the <i>ladies</i> of the <i>naffs</i> were there; and there were upon the roof about <i>trey</i> <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i> and <i>palones</i>, that beheld while Samson made sport.
</li>
<li>And Samson <i>screeched</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, O <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O <i>Gloria</i>, that I may be at once avenged of the <i>naffs</i> for my <i>dewey</i> <i>ogles</i>.
</li>
<li>And Samson <i>lelled</i> hold of the <i>dewey</i> middle pillars upon which the <i>lattie</i> stood, and on which it was borne up, of the <i>una</i> with <i>her</i> <i>sweet martini</i>, and of the other with <i>her</i> <i>dry</i>.
</li>
<li>And Samson <i>cackled</i>, Let me <i>cark it</i> with the <i>naffs</i>. And <i>she</i> bowed himself with all <i>her</i> might; and the <i>lattie</i> fell upon the <i>ladies</i>, and upon all the <i>homies and palones</i> that were therein. So the <i>stiff</i> which <i>she</i> <i>ferricadoozaed</i> at <i>her</i> <i>carking it</i> were more than they which <i>she</i> <i>ferricadoozaed</i> in <i>her</i> life.
</li>
<li>Then <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i> and all the <i>lattie</i> of <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> <i>trolled</i> down, and <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i>, and brought <i>her</i> up, and buried <i>her</i> between Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>. And <i>she</i> judged Israel <i>dewey dacha</i> years.

<h2>Chapter 17</h2>
<ol>
<li>And there was a <i>homie</i> of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> mother, The <i>long dedger</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>medzers</i> of silver that were <i>lelled</i> from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine <i>aunt nelly cheats</i>, <i>varda</i>, the silver is with me; I <i>lelled</i> it. And <i>her</i> mother <i>cackled</i>, <i>fabed</i> be thou of the <i>Duchess</i>, my <i>homie chavvie</i>.
</li>
<li>And when <i>she</i> had restored the <i>long dedger</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>medzers</i> of silver to <i>her</i> mother, <i>her</i> mother <i>cackled</i>, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the <i>Duchess</i> from my <i>famble</i> for my <i>homie chavvie</i>, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.
</li>
<li>Yet <i>she</i> restored the <i>dinarly</i> unto <i>her</i> mother; and <i>her</i> mother <i>lelled</i> <i>dewey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>medzers</i> of silver, and <i>parkered</i> them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the <i>lattie</i> of Micah.
</li>
<li>And the <i>homie</i> Micah had an <i>lattie</i> of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated <i>una</i> of <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>, who became <i>her</i> <i>godly homie</i>.
</li>
<li>In those days there was no <i>dowriest homie</i> in Israel, but every <i>homie</i> did that which was <i>sweet</i> in <i>her</i> own <i>ogles</i>.
</li>
<li>And there was a <i>bean cove</i> out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and <i>she</i> sojourned there.
</li>
<li>And the <i>homie</i> <i>trolled off</i> out of the <i>smoke</i> from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where <i>she</i> could find a place: and <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> to mount Ephraim to the <i>lattie</i> of Micah, as <i>she</i> journeyed.
</li>
<li>And Micah <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Whence comest thou? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I <i>troll</i> to sojourn where I may find a place.
</li>
<li>And Micah <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>lett</i> with me, and be unto me a <i>Auntie</i> and a <i>godly homie</i>, and I will <i>parker</i> thee <i>dacha</i> <i>medzers</i> of silver by the year, and a suit of <i>schmutter</i>, and thy victuals. So the Levite <i>trolled</i> in.
</li>
<li>And the Levite was content to <i>lett</i> with the <i>homie</i>; and the <i>bean cove</i> was unto <i>her</i> as <i>una</i> of <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>.
</li>
<li>And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the <i>bean cove</i> became <i>her</i> <i>godly homie</i>, and was in the <i>lattie</i> of Micah.
</li>
<li>Then <i>cackled</i> Micah, Now know I that the <i>Duchess</i> will do me <i>bona</i>, <i>vardaing</i> I have a Levite to my <i>godly homie</i>.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Chapter 18</h2>
<ol>
<li>In those days there was no <i>dowriest homie</i> in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to <i>lett</i> in; for unto that <i>journo</i> all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel.
</li>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Dan <i>laued</i> of their family <i>chinker</i> <i>homies</i> from their coasts, <i>homies</i> of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>troll</i>, search the land: who when they <i>trolled</i> to mount Ephraim, to the <i>lattie</i> of Micah, they lodged there.
</li>
<li>When they were by the <i>lattie</i> of Micah, they knew the <i>cackling fakement</i> of the <i>bean cove</i> the Levite: and they turned in thither, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this place? and what hast thou here?
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am <i>her</i> <i>godly homie</i>.
</li>
<li>And they <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of <i>Gloria</i>, that we may know whether our way which we <i>troll</i> shall be prosperous.
</li>
<li>And the <i>godly homie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>sling yer hook</i>: before the <i>Duchess</i> is your way wherein ye <i>troll</i>.
</li>
<li>Then the <i>chinker</i> <i>homies</i> <i>trolled off</i>, and <i>trolled</i> to Laish, and <i>vardad</i> the <i>homies and palones</i> that were therein, how they <i>letted</i> careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no <i>beak</i> in the land, that might put them to <i>scharda</i> in any <i>fakement</i>; and they were <i>nishter ajax</i> the Zidonians, and had no business with any <i>homie</i>.
</li>
<li>And they <i>trolled</i> unto their <i>sisters</i> to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their <i>sisters</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, What <i>cackle</i> ye?
</li>
<li>And they <i>cackled</i>, Arise, that we may <i>troll</i> up against them: for we have <i>vardad</i> the land, and, <i>varda</i>, it is <i>dowry</i> <i>bona</i>: and are ye still? be not slothful to <i>troll</i>, and to enter to possess the land.
</li>
<li>When ye <i>troll</i>, ye shall <i>troll</i> unto a <i>homies and palones</i> secure, and to a large land: for <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>parkered</i> it into your <i>fambles</i>; a place where there is no want of any <i>fakement</i> that is in the earth.
</li>
<li>And there <i>trolled</i> from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, <i>sey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>homies</i> appointed with weapons of <i>barney</i>.
</li>
<li>And they <i>trolled</i> up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah: wherefore they <i>screeched</i> that place Mahanehdan unto this <i>journo</i>: <i>varda</i>, it is behind Kirjathjearim.
</li>
<li>And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and <i>trolled</i> unto the <i>lattie</i> of Micah.
</li>
<li>Then answered the <i>chinker</i> <i>homies</i> that <i>trolled</i> to spy out the country of Laish, and <i>cackled</i> unto their <i>sisters</i>, Do ye know that there is in these <i>latties</i> an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.
</li>
<li>And they turned thitherward, and <i>trolled</i> to the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>bean cove</i> the Levite, even unto the <i>lattie</i> of Micah, and saluted <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>sey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>homies</i> appointed with their weapons of <i>barney</i>, which were of the <i>chavvies</i> of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate.
</li>
<li>And the <i>chinker</i> <i>homies</i> that <i>trolled</i> to spy out the land <i>trolled</i> up, and <i>trolled</i> in thither, and <i>lelled</i> the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the <i>godly homie</i> stood in the entering of the gate with the <i>sey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>homies</i> that were appointed with weapons of <i>barney</i>.
</li>
<li>And these <i>trolled</i> into Micah&#8217;s <i>lattie</i>, and fetched the carved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then <i>cackled</i> the <i>godly homie</i> unto them, What do ye?
</li>
<li>And they <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Hold thy peace, <i>lett</i> thine <i>famble</i> upon thy <i>screech</i>, and <i>troll</i> with us, and be to us a <i>Auntie</i> and a <i>godly homie</i>: is it <i>benar</i> for thee to be a <i>godly homie</i> unto the <i>lattie</i> of <i>una</i> <i>homie</i>, or that thou be a <i>godly homie</i> unto a tribe and a family in Israel?
</li>
<li>And the <i>godly homie</i>&#8216;s <i>thumping cheat</i> was glad, and <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and <i>trolled</i> in the midst of the <i>homies and palones</i>.
</li>
<li>So they turned and <i>trolled off</i>, and put the <i>bijou</i> ones and the cattle and the carriage before them.
</li>
<li>And when they were a <i>bona</i> way from the <i>lattie</i> of Micah, the <i>homies</i> that were in the <i>latties</i> near to Micah&#8217;s <i>lattie</i> were gathered together, and overtook the <i>chavvies</i> of Dan.
</li>
<li>And they <i>screeched</i> unto the <i>chavvies</i> of Dan. And they turned their <i>ekes</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Ye have <i>lelled</i> away my gods which I made, and the <i>godly homie</i>, and ye are <i>trolled</i> away: and what have I more? and what is this that ye <i>cackle</i> unto me, What aileth thee?
</li>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Dan <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Let not thy <i>cackling fakement</i> be <i>aunt nelled</i> among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.
</li>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Dan <i>trolled</i> their way: and when Micah <i>vardad</i> that they were too <i>butch</i> for <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> turned and <i>trolled</i> back unto <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>.
</li>
<li>And they <i>lelled</i> the <i>fakements</i> which Micah had made, and the <i>godly homie</i> which <i>she</i> had, and <i>trolled</i> unto Laish, unto a <i>homies and palones</i> that were at quiet and secure: and they <i>slapped</i> them with the edge of the <i>dowry efink</i>, and burnt the <i>smoke</i> with <i>binco fakement</i>.
</li>
<li>And there was no deliverer, because it was <i>nishter ajax</i> Zidon, and they had no business with any <i>homie</i>; and it was in the valley that <i>lettieth</i> by Bethrehob. And they built a <i>smoke</i>, and <i>letted</i> therein.
</li>
<li>And they <i>screeched</i> the name of the <i>smoke</i> Dan, after the name of Dan their <i>Auntie</i>, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the <i>smoke</i> was Laish at the first.
</li>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Gershom, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Manasseh, <i>she</i> and <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> were <i>godly homies</i> to the tribe of Dan until the <i>journo</i> of the captivity of the land.
</li>
<li>And they set them up Micah&#8217;s graven image, which <i>she</i> made, all the time that the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> was in Shiloh.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Chapter 19</h2>
<ol>
<li><i>Any road up</i> in those days, when there was no <i>dowriest homie</i> in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim, who <i>lelled</i> to <i>her</i> a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah.
</li>
<li>And <i>her</i> concubine played the <i>bitaine</i> against <i>her</i>, and <i>trolled</i> away from <i>her</i> unto her <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i> to Bethlehemjudah, and was there <i>quarter</i> whole months.
</li>
<li>And her <i>homie affair</i> arose, and <i>trolled</i> after her, to <i>cackle</i> friendly unto her, and to <i>parker</i> her again, having <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i> with <i>her</i>, and a couple of asses: and she brought <i>her</i> into her <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>: and when the <i>Auntie</i> of the damsel <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> rejoiced to meet <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> in law, the damsel&#8217;s <i>Auntie</i>, retained <i>her</i>; and <i>she</i> <i>letted</i> with <i>her</i> <i>trey</i> days: so they did <i>jarry</i> and <i>buvare</i>, and lodged there.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i> on the <i>quarter</i> <i>journo</i>, when they arose early in the morning, that <i>she</i> rose up to <i>troll off</i>: and the damsel&#8217;s <i>Auntie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> in law, Comfort thine <i>thumping cheat</i> with a morsel of <i>pannan</i>, and afterward <i>troll</i> your way.
</li>
<li>And they sat down, and did <i>jarry</i> and <i>buvare</i> both of them together: for the damsel&#8217;s <i>Auntie</i> had <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>homie</i>, Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all <i>nochy</i>, and let thine <i>thumping cheat</i> be merry.
</li>
<li>And when the <i>homie</i> rose up to <i>troll off</i>, <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> in law urged <i>her</i>: therefore <i>she</i> lodged there again.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> arose early in the morning on the fifth <i>journo</i> to <i>troll off</i>; and the damsel&#8217;s <i>Auntie</i> <i>cackled</i>, Comfort thine <i>thumping cheat</i>, I pray thee. And they tarried until afternoon, and they did <i>jarry</i> both of them.
</li>
<li>And when the <i>homie</i> rose up to <i>troll off</i>, <i>she</i>, and <i>her</i> concubine, and <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i>, <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> in law, the damsel&#8217;s <i>Auntie</i>, <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>varda</i>, now the <i>journo</i> draweth toward <i>bijou nochy</i>, I pray you tarry all <i>nochy</i>: <i>varda</i>, the <i>journo</i> groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine <i>thumping cheat</i> may be merry; and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest <i>troll</i> home.
</li>
<li>But the <i>homie</i> would not tarry that <i>nochy</i>, but <i>she</i> rose up and <i>trolled off</i>, and <i>trolled</i> over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and there were with <i>her</i> <i>dewey</i> asses saddled, <i>her</i> concubine also was with <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And when they were by Jebus, the <i>journo</i> was far spent; and the <i>serving homie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> master, <i>troll</i>, I pray thee, and let us turn in into this <i>smoke</i> of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.
</li>
<li>And <i>her</i> master <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, We will not turn aside hither into the <i>smoke</i> of a stranger, that is not of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel; we will <i>troll over</i> to Gibeah.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i>, <i>troll</i>, and let us draw near to <i>una</i> of these places to lodge all <i>nochy</i>, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.
</li>
<li>And they passed on and <i>trolled</i> their way; and the sun <i>trolled</i> down upon them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin.
</li>
<li>And they turned aside thither, to <i>troll</i> in and to lodge in Gibeah: and when <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> in, <i>she</i> sat <i>her</i> down in a street of the <i>smoke</i>: for there was no <i>homie</i> that <i>lelled</i> them into <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i> to lodging.
</li>
<li>And, <i>varda</i>, there <i>trolled</i> an <i>badge cove</i> from <i>her</i> <i>acting dickey</i> out of the field at even, which was also of mount Ephraim; and <i>she</i> sojourned in Gibeah: but the <i>homies</i> of the place were Benjamites.
</li>
<li>And when <i>she</i> had lifted up <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i>, <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> a wayfaring <i>homie</i> in the street of the <i>smoke</i>: and the <i>badge cove</i> <i>cackled</i>, Whither <i>trollest</i> thou? and whence comest thou?
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, We are passing from Bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I: and I <i>trolled</i> to Bethlehemjudah, but I am now going to the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>; and there is no <i>homie</i> that receiveth me to <i>lattie</i>.
</li>
<li>Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is <i>pannan</i> and <i>sherry</i> also for me, and for thy <i>famble palone</i>, and for the <i>bean cove</i> which is with thy <i>serving homies</i>: there is no want of any <i>fakement</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>badge cove</i> <i>cackled</i>, Peace be with thee; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.
</li>
<li>So <i>she</i> brought <i>her</i> into <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>, and <i>parkered</i> provender unto the asses: and they <i>dhobied</i> their <i>plates</i>, and did <i>jarry</i> and <i>buvare</i>.
</li>
<li>Now as they were making their <i>thumping cheats</i> merry, <i>varda</i>, the <i>homies</i> of the <i>smoke</i>, certain <i>homie chavvies</i> of Belial, beset the <i>lattie</i> round about, and <i>zsa zsa-ed</i> at the door, and <i>cackled</i> to the master of the <i>lattie</i>, the <i>badge cove</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>parker</i> forth the <i>homie</i> that <i>trolled</i> into thine <i>lattie</i>, that we may know <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>homie</i>, the master of the <i>lattie</i>, <i>trolled</i> out unto them, and <i>cackled</i> unto them, Nay, my <i>sisters</i>, nay, I pray you, <i>nix</i> so wickedly; <i>vardaing</i> that this <i>homie</i> is <i>troll</i> into mine <i>lattie</i>, <i>nix</i> this folly.
</li>
<li><i>Varda</i>, here is my <i>palone chavvie</i> a maiden, and <i>her</i> concubine; them I will <i>parker</i> out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth <i>bona</i> unto you: but unto this <i>homie</i> <i>nix</i> so vile a <i>fakement</i>.
</li>
<li>But the <i>homies</i> would not <i>aunt nell</i> to <i>her</i>: so the <i>homie</i> <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the <i>nochy</i> until the morning: and when the <i>journo</i> began to spring, they let her <i>troll</i>.
</li>
<li>Then <i>trolled</i> the <i>palone</i> in the dawning of the <i>journo</i>, and fell down at the door of the <i>homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i> where her <i>Duchess</i> was, till it was <i>sparkle</i>.
</li>
<li>And her <i>Duchess</i> rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the <i>lattie</i>, and <i>trolled</i> out to <i>troll</i> <i>her</i> way: and, <i>varda</i>, the <i>palone</i> <i>her</i> concubine was fallen down at the door of the <i>lattie</i>, and her <i>fambles</i> were upon the threshold.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered. Then the <i>homie</i> <i>lelled</i> her up upon an ass, and the <i>homie</i> rose up, and gat <i>her</i> unto <i>her</i> place.
</li>
<li>And when <i>she</i> was <i>troll</i> into <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>, <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> a <i>efink</i>, and <i>laued</i> hold on <i>her</i> concubine, and <i>medzered</i> her, together with her bones, into <i>kenza</i> pieces, and <i>laued</i> her into all the coasts of Israel.
</li>
<li>And it was so, that all that <i>vardad</i> it <i>cackled</i>, There was no such deed done <i>nishta</i> <i>vardad</i> from the <i>journo</i> that the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>trolled</i> up out of the land of Egypt unto this <i>journo</i>: consider of it, <i>lell</i> advice, and <i>cackle</i> your minds.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Chapter 20</h2>
<ol>
<li>Then all the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>trolled</i> out, and the <i>punters</i> was gathered together as <i>una</i> <i>homie</i>, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, unto the <i>Duchess</i> in Mizpeh.
</li>
<li>And the <i>dowriest</i> of all the <i>homies and palones</i>, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the <i>homies and palones</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, <i>quarter</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>mille</i> footmen that drew <i>dowry efink</i>.
</li>
<li>(Now the <i>chavvies</i> of Benjamin <i>aunt nelled</i> that the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel were <i>trolled</i> up to Mizpeh. ) Then <i>cackled</i> the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, <i>cackle</i> us, how was this <i>naffness</i>?
</li>
<li>And the Levite, the <i>homie affair</i> of the <i>palone</i> that was <i>ferricadoozed</i>, answered and <i>cackled</i>, I <i>trolled</i> into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.
</li>
<li>And the <i>homies</i> of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the <i>lattie</i> round about upon me by <i>nochy</i>, and thought to have <i>ferricadoozed</i> me: and my concubine have they forced, that she is <i>stiff</i>.
</li>
<li>And I <i>lelled</i> my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and <i>laued</i> her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.
</li>
<li><i>Varda</i>, ye are all <i>chavvies</i> of Israel; <i>parker</i> here your advice and counsel.
</li>
<li>And all the <i>homies and palones</i> arose as <i>una</i> <i>homie</i>, <i>cackling</i>, We will not any of us <i>troll</i> to <i>her</i> <i>trolling lettie</i>, <i>nishta</i> will we any of us turn into <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>.
</li>
<li>But now this shall be the <i>fakement</i> which we will do to Gibeah; we will <i>troll</i> up by lot against it;
</li>
<li>And we will <i>lell</i> <i>dacha</i> <i>homies</i> of an <i>chenter</i> throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an <i>chenter</i> of a <i>mille</i>, and a <i>mille</i> out of <i>dacha</i> <i>mille</i>, to fetch victual for the <i>homies and palones</i>, that they may do, when they <i>troll</i> to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.
</li>
<li>So all the <i>homies</i> of Israel were gathered against the <i>smoke</i>, knit together as <i>una</i> <i>homie</i>.
</li>
<li>And the tribes of Israel <i>laued</i> <i>homies</i> through all the tribe of Benjamin, <i>cackling</i>, What <i>naffness</i> is this that is done among you?
</li>
<li>Now therefore deliver us the <i>homies</i>, the <i>chavvies</i> of Belial, which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to <i>carking it</i>, and put away <i>nana</i> from Israel. But the <i>chavvies</i> of Benjamin would not <i>aunt nell</i> to the <i>cackling fakement</i> of their <i>sisters</i> the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel.
</li>
<li>But the <i>chavvies</i> of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the <i>smokes</i> unto Gibeah, to <i>troll out</i> to battle against the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel.
</li>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the <i>smokes</i> <i>dewey dacha</i> and <i>sey</i> <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i> that drew <i>dowry efink</i>, beside the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered <i>setter</i> <i>chenter</i> chosen <i>homies</i>.
</li>
<li>Among all this <i>homies and palones</i> there were <i>setter</i> <i>chenter</i> chosen <i>homies</i> lefthanded; every <i>una</i> could sling stones at an <i>riah</i> breadth, and not miss.
</li>
<li>And the <i>homies</i> of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered <i>quarter</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i> that drew <i>dowry efink</i>: all these were <i>homies</i> of <i>barney</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel arose, and <i>trolled</i> up to the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and asked counsel of <i>Gloria</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Which of us shall <i>troll</i> up first to the battle against the <i>chavvies</i> of Benjamin? And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i>, Judah shall <i>troll</i> up first.
</li>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.
</li>
<li>And the <i>homies</i> of Israel <i>trolled</i> out to battle against Benjamin; and the <i>homies</i> of Israel put themselves in array to <i>palaver</i> against them at Gibeah.
</li>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Benjamin <i>trolled</i> forth out of Gibeah, and <i>battyfanged</i> down to the ground of the Israelites that <i>journo</i> <i>dewey dacha</i> and <i>dewey</i> <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>homies and palones</i> the <i>homies</i> of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first <i>journo</i>.
</li>
<li>(And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>trolled</i> up and <i>parnied</i> before the <i>Duchess</i> until even, and asked counsel of the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Shall I <i>troll</i> up again to battle against the <i>chavvies</i> of Benjamin my <i>sister</i>? And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>troll</i> up against <i>her</i>. )
</li>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>trolled</i> near against the <i>chavvies</i> of Benjamin the second <i>journo</i>.
</li>
<li>And Benjamin <i>trolled</i> forth against them out of Gibeah the second <i>journo</i>, and <i>battyfanged</i> down to the ground of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel again eighteen <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i>; all these drew the <i>dowry efink</i>.
</li>
<li>Then all the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, and all the <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>trolled</i> up, and <i>trolled</i> unto the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and <i>parnied</i>, and sat there before the <i>Duchess</i>, and fasted that <i>journo</i> until even, and offered burnt <i>parkerings</i> and peace <i>parkerings</i> before the <i>Duchess</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel enquired of the <i>Duchess</i>, (for the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the covenant of <i>Gloria</i> was there in those days,
</li>
<li>And Phinehas, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Eleazar, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) <i>cackling</i>, Shall I yet again <i>troll out</i> to battle against the <i>chavvies</i> of Benjamin my <i>sister</i>, or shall I cease? And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>troll</i> up; for to morrow I will deliver them into thine <i>famble</i>.
</li>
<li>And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.
</li>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>trolled</i> up against the <i>chavvies</i> of Benjamin on the third <i>journo</i>, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.
</li>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Benjamin <i>trolled</i> out against the <i>homies and palones</i>, and were drawn away from the <i>smoke</i>; and they began to <i>slap</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i>, and <i>ferricadoza</i>, as at other times, in the highways, of which <i>una</i> goeth up to the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about <i>trey dacha</i> <i>homies</i> of Israel.
</li>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Benjamin <i>cackled</i>, They are smitten down before us, as at the first. But the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>cackled</i>, Let us <i>scarper</i>, and draw them from the <i>smoke</i> unto the highways.
</li>
<li>And all the <i>homies</i> of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of Israel <i>trolled</i> forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah.
</li>
<li>And there <i>trolled</i> against Gibeah <i>dacha</i> <i>mille</i> chosen <i>homies</i> out of all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that <i>nana</i> was near them.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>slapped</i> Benjamin before Israel: and the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>battyfanged</i> of the Benjamites that <i>journo</i> <i>dewey dacha</i> and <i>chinker</i> <i>mille</i> and an <i>chenter</i> <i>homies</i>: all these drew the <i>dowry efink</i>.
</li>
<li>So the <i>chavvies</i> of Benjamin <i>vardad</i> that they were smitten: for the <i>homies</i> of Israel <i>parkered</i> place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.
</li>
<li>And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew themselves along, and <i>slapped</i> all the <i>smoke</i> with the edge of the <i>dowry efink</i>.
</li>
<li>Now there was an appointed sign between the <i>homies</i> of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a <i>dowry</i> flame with smoke rise up out of the <i>smoke</i>.
</li>
<li>And when the <i>homies</i> of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to <i>slap</i> and <i>ferricadoza</i> of the <i>homies</i> of Israel about <i>trey dacha</i> persons: for they <i>cackled</i>, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.
</li>
<li>But when the flame began to arise up out of the <i>smoke</i> with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, <i>varda</i>, the flame of the <i>smoke</i> <i>trolled up</i> up to heaven.
</li>
<li>And when the <i>homies</i> of Israel turned again, the <i>homies</i> of Benjamin were <i>gobsmacked</i>: for they <i>vardad</i> that <i>nana</i> was <i>troll</i> upon them.
</li>
<li>Therefore they turned their backs before the <i>homies</i> of Israel unto the way of the <i>nishta smoke</i>; but the battle overtook them; and them which <i>trolled</i> out of the <i>smokes</i> they <i>battyfanged</i> in the midst of them.
</li>
<li>Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the sunrising.
</li>
<li>And there fell of Benjamin eighteen <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i>; all these were <i>homies</i> of valour.
</li>
<li>And they turned and fled toward the <i>nishta smoke</i> unto the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways <i>chinker</i> <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i>; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> <i>dewey</i> <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i> of them.
</li>
<li>So that all which fell that <i>journo</i> of Benjamin were <i>dewey dacha</i> and <i>chinker</i> <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i> that drew the <i>dowry efink</i>; all these were <i>homies</i> of valour.
</li>
<li>But <i>sey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>homies</i> turned and fled to the <i>nishta smoke</i> unto the rock Rimmon, and <i>letted</i> in the rock Rimmon <i>quarter</i> months.
</li>
<li>And the <i>homies</i> of Israel turned again upon the <i>chavvies</i> of Benjamin, and <i>slapped</i> them with the edge of the <i>dowry efink</i>, as well the <i>homies</i> of every <i>smoke</i>, as the beast, and all that <i>trolled</i> to <i>famble</i>: also they set on <i>binco fakement</i> all the <i>smokes</i> that they <i>trolled</i> to.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Chapter 21</h2>
<ol>
<li>Now the <i>homies</i> of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, <i>cackling</i>, There shall not any of us <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> <i>palone chavvie</i> unto Benjamin to <i>palone affair</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>trolled</i> to the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and <i>letted</i> there till even before <i>Gloria</i>, and lifted up their voices, and <i>parnied</i> sore;
</li>
<li>And <i>cackled</i>, O <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, why is this <i>troll</i> to pass in Israel, that there should be to <i>journo</i> <i>una</i> tribe lacking in Israel?
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i> on the morrow, that the <i>homies and palones</i> rose early, and built there an <i>grovelling fakement</i>, and offered burnt <i>parkerings</i> and peace <i>parkerings</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>cackled</i>, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that <i>trolled</i> not up with the <i>punters</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>? For they had made a <i>dowry</i> oath concerning <i>her</i> that <i>trolled</i> not up to the <i>Duchess</i> to Mizpeh, <i>cackling</i>, <i>she</i> shall surely be put to <i>carking it</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel repented them for Benjamin their <i>sister</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, There is <i>una</i> tribe cut off from Israel this <i>journo</i>.
</li>
<li>How shall we do for <i>palone affairs</i> for them that remain, <i>vardaing</i> we have sworn by the <i>Duchess</i> that we will not <i>parker</i> them of our <i>palone chavvies</i> to <i>palone affairs</i>?
</li>
<li>And they <i>cackled</i>, What <i>una</i> is there of the tribes of Israel that <i>trolled</i> not up to Mizpeh to the <i>Duchess</i>? And, <i>varda</i>, there <i>trolled</i> none to the camp from Jabeshgilead to the assembly.
</li>
<li>For the <i>homies and palones</i> were numbered, and, <i>varda</i>, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there.
</li>
<li>And the <i>punters</i> <i>laued</i> thither <i>kenza</i> <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i> of the valiantest, and commanded them, <i>cackling</i>, <i>troll</i> and <i>slap</i> the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the <i>dowry efink</i>, with the <i>palones</i> and the <i>chavvies</i>.
</li>
<li>And this is the <i>fakement</i> that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly <i>battyfang</i> every <i>omee</i>, and every <i>palone</i> that hath lain by <i>homie</i>.
</li>
<li>And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead <i>quarter</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>bean</i> <i>nanti charvers</i>, that had known no <i>homie</i> by lying with any <i>omee</i>: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
</li>
<li>And the whole <i>punters</i> <i>laued</i> some to <i>cackle</i> to the <i>chavvies</i> of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to <i>screech</i> peaceably unto them.
</li>
<li>And Benjamin <i>trolled</i> again at that time; and they <i>parkered</i> them <i>palone affairs</i> which they had saved alive of the <i>palones</i> of Jabeshgilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.
</li>
<li>And the <i>homies and palones</i> repented them for Benjamin, because that the <i>Duchess</i> had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
</li>
<li>Then the <i>fungi</i> of the <i>punters</i> <i>cackled</i>, How shall we do for <i>palone affairs</i> for them that remain, <i>vardaing</i> the <i>palones</i> are <i>battyfanged</i> out of Benjamin?
</li>
<li>And they <i>cackled</i>, There must be an inheritance for them that be <i>scarpered</i> of Benjamin, that a tribe be not <i>battyfanged</i> out of Israel.
</li>
<li>Howbeit we may not <i>parker</i> them <i>palone affairs</i> of our <i>palone chavvies</i>: for the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel have sworn, <i>cackling</i>, Cursed be <i>she</i> that giveth a <i>palone affair</i> to Benjamin.
</li>
<li>Then they <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, there is a <i>dowry munjarlee</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.
</li>
<li>Therefore they commanded the <i>chavvies</i> of Benjamin, <i>cackling</i>, <i>troll</i> and lie in wait in the vineyards;
</li>
<li>And <i>varda</i>, and, <i>varda</i>, if the <i>palone chavvies</i> of Shiloh <i>troll</i> out to <i>wallop</i> in dances, then <i>troll</i> ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every <i>homie</i> <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i> of the <i>palone chavvies</i> of Shiloh, and <i>troll</i> to the land of Benjamin.
</li>
<li>And it shall be, when their <i>aunties</i> or their <i>sisters</i> <i>troll</i> unto us to complain, that we will <i>cackle</i> unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each <i>homie</i> <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i> in the <i>barney</i>: for ye did not <i>parker</i> unto them at this time, that ye should be guilty.
</li>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Benjamin did so, and <i>lelled</i> them <i>palone affairs</i>, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they <i>trolled</i> and <i>trolled back</i> unto their inheritance, and repaired the <i>smokes</i>, and <i>letted</i> in them.
</li>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>trolled off</i> thence at that time, every <i>homie</i> to <i>her</i> tribe and to <i>her</i> family, and they <i>trolled</i> out from thence every <i>homie</i> to <i>her</i> inheritance.
</li>
<li>In those days there was no <i>dowriest homie</i> in Israel: every <i>homie</i> did that which was <i>sweet</i> in <i>her</i> own <i>ogles</i>.
