    <h1>Micah</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>The <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> that <i>trolled</i> to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, <i>dowriest homies</i> of Judah, which <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li><i>Aunt nell</i>, all ye <i>homies and palones</i>; <i>aunt nell</i>, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> be <i>varda-ing fakement</i> against you, the <i>Duchess</i> from <i>her</i> <i>fabulosa</i> <i>holy carsey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For, <i>varda</i>, the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolleth</i> forth out of <i>her</i> place, and will <i>troll</i> down, and <i>mince</i> upon the high places of the earth.
    </li>
    <li>And the mountains shall be molten under <i>her</i>, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the <i>binco fakement</i>, and as the <i>aquas</i> that are poured down a steep place.
    </li>
    <li>For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the <i>kertervers</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem?
    </li>
    <li>Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, and as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.
    </li>
    <li>And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the <i>binco fakement</i>, and all the idols thereof will I <i>lett</i> desolate: for she gathered it of the hire of an <i>charvering donna</i>, and they shall <i>troll back to</i> the hire of an <i>charvering donna</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore I will wail and howl, I will <i>troll</i> stripped and <i>nanti zhoosh</i>: I will make a wailing like the <i>drag queens</i>, and mourning as the owls.
    </li>
    <li>For her wound is incurable; for it is <i>troll</i> unto Judah; <i>she</i> is <i>troll</i> unto the gate of my <i>homies and palones</i>, even to Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li><i>Screech</i> ye it not at Gath, <i>parnie</i> ye not at all: in the <i>lattie</i> of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.
    </li>
    <li>Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy <i>scharda</i> <i>nanti zhoosh</i>: the inhabitant of Zaanan <i>trolled</i> not forth in the mourning of Bethezel; <i>she</i> shall <i>lall</i> of you <i>her</i> standing.
    </li>
    <li>For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for <i>bona</i>: but <i>nana</i> <i>trolled</i> down from the <i>Duchess</i> unto the gate of Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the <i>trundling cheat</i> to the swift beast: she is the beginning of the <i>kertever</i> to the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore shalt thou <i>parker</i> presents to Moreshethgath: the <i>latties</i> of Achzib shall be a lie to the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>Yet will I <i>parker</i> an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: <i>she</i> shall <i>troll</i> unto Adullam the <i>fabeness</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate <i>chavvies</i>; enlarge thy <i>nanti riah</i> as the eagle; for they are <i>trolled</i> into captivity from thee.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Woe to them that devise <i>codness</i>, and <i>acting dickey</i> <i>nana</i> upon their beds! when the morning is <i>sparkle</i>, they practise it, because it is in the power of their <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>ogle</i> fields, and <i>lell</i> them by <i>slapping</i>; and <i>latties</i>, and <i>lell</i> them away: so they oppress a <i>homie</i> and <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>, even a <i>homie</i> and <i>her</i> heritage.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>; <i>varda</i>, against this family do I devise an <i>nana</i>, from which <i>nanti</i> remove your necks; <i>nishta</i> shall ye <i>troll</i> haughtily: for this time is <i>nana</i>.
    </li>
    <li>In that <i>journo</i> shall <i>una</i> <i>lell</i> up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, and <i>cackle</i>, We be utterly spoiled: <i>she</i> hath changed the portion of my <i>homies and palones</i>: how hath <i>she</i> removed it from me! turning away <i>she</i> hath <i>medzered</i> our fields.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the <i>punters</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Prophesy ye not, <i>cackle</i> they to them that prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, that they shall not <i>lell</i> <i>scharda</i>.
    </li>
    <li>O thou that art named the <i>lattie</i> of Jacob, is the <i>Fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> straitened? are these <i>her</i> doings? <i>nix</i> my <i>lavs</i> do <i>bona</i> to <i>her</i> that <i>minceth</i> uprightly?
    </li>
    <li>Even of late my <i>homies and palones</i> is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the <i>frock</i> with the <i>frock</i> from them that <i>troll by</i> securely as <i>homies</i> averse from <i>barney</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>palones</i> of my <i>homies and palones</i> have ye cast out from their <i>dolly</i> <i>latties</i>; from their <i>chavvies</i> have ye <i>lelled</i> away my <i>fabeness</i> for ever.
    </li>
    <li>Arise ye, and <i>troll off</i>; for this is not your <i>lettie</i>: because it is <i>dingy</i>, it shall <i>battyfang</i> you, even with a sore destruction.
    </li>
    <li>If a <i>homie</i> <i>mincing</i> in the <i>Fairy</i> and falsehood do lie, <i>cackling</i>, I will prophesy unto thee of <i>sherry</i> and of <i>butch</i> <i>buvare</i>; <i>she</i> shall even be the prophet of this <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make <i>dowry</i> <i>screech</i> by reason of the multitude of <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The breaker is <i>troll</i> up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are <i>trolled</i> out by it: and their <i>dowriest homie</i> shall pass before them, and the <i>Duchess</i> on the <i>eke</i> of them.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And I <i>cackled</i>, <i>aunt nell</i>, I pray you, O <i>ekes</i> of Jacob, and ye <i>princesses</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of Israel; Is it not for you to know judgment?
    </li>
    <li>Who hate the <i>bona</i>, and love the <i>nana</i>; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;
    </li>
    <li>Who also <i>jarry</i> the flesh of my <i>homies and palones</i>, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.
    </li>
    <li>Then shall they <i>screech</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>, but <i>she</i> will not <i>aunt nell</i> them: <i>she</i> will even hide <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings.
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> concerning the prophets that make my <i>homies and palones</i> err, that bite with their <i>hampsteads</i>, and <i>screech</i>, Peace; and <i>she</i> that <i>laueth</i> not into their <i>screeches</i>, they even prepare <i>barney</i> against <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore <i>nochy</i> shall be unto you, that <i>nanti</i> have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that <i>nanti</i> divine; and the sun shall <i>troll</i> down over the prophets, and the <i>journo</i> shall be dark over them.
    </li>
    <li>Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners <i>bamboozled</i>: <i>any road up</i>, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But truly I am full of power by the <i>Fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and of judgment, and of might, to <i>screech</i> unto Jacob <i>her</i> transgression, and to Israel <i>her</i> <i>kertever</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Aunt nell</i> this, I pray you, ye <i>ekes</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of Jacob, and <i>princesses</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity.
    </li>
    <li>They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with <i>codness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>ekes</i> thereof <i>beak</i> for <i>parkering</i>, and the <i>godly homies</i> thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for <i>dinarly</i>: yet will they lean upon the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>cackle</i>, Is not the <i>Duchess</i> among us? none <i>nana</i> can <i>troll</i> upon us.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the <i>lattie</i> as the high places of the forest.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>But in the last days it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, that the mountain of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and <i>homies and palones</i> shall flow unto it.
    </li>
    <li>And many nations shall <i>troll</i>, and <i>cackle</i>, <i>troll</i>, and let us <i>troll</i> up to the mountain of the <i>Duchess</i>, and to the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Gloria</i> of Jacob; and <i>she</i> will teach us of <i>her</i> ways, and we will <i>mince</i> in <i>her</i> paths: for the law shall <i>troll forth</i> of Zion, and the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> from Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> shall <i>beak</i> among many <i>homies and palones</i>, and rebuke <i>butch</i> nations <i>nishta ajax</i> off; and they shall <i>zsa zsa-ed</i> their <i>dowry efinks</i> into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a <i>dowry efink</i> against nation, <i>nishta</i> shall they learn <i>barney</i> any more.
    </li>
    <li>But they shall <i>lett</i> every <i>homie</i> under <i>her</i> vine and under <i>her</i> fig tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the <i>screech</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts hath <i>cackled</i> it.
    </li>
    <li>For all <i>homies and palones</i> will <i>mince</i> every <i>una</i> in the name of <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i>, and we will <i>mince</i> in the name of the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i> for ever and ever.
    </li>
    <li>In that <i>journo</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, will I assemble her that halteth, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted;
    </li>
    <li>And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a <i>butch</i> nation: and the <i>Duchess</i> shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever.
    </li>
    <li>And thou, O tower of the flock, the <i>butch</i> hold of the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Zion, unto thee shall it <i>troll</i>, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall <i>troll</i> to the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>Now why dost thou <i>screech</i> out aloud? is there no <i>dowriest homie</i> in thee? is thy counsellor perished? for pangs have <i>lelled</i> thee as a <i>palone</i> in travail.
    </li>
    <li>Be in pain, and <i>acting dickey</i> to <i>parker</i> forth, O <i>palone chavvie</i> of Zion, like a <i>palone</i> in travail: for now shalt thou <i>troll forth</i> out of the <i>smoke</i>, and thou shalt <i>lett</i> in the field, and thou shalt <i>troll</i> even to Babylon; there shalt thou be <i>laued</i>; there the <i>Duchess</i> shall redeem thee from the <i>famble</i> of thine enemies.
    </li>
    <li>Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that <i>cackle</i>, Let her be defiled, and let our <i>ogle</i> <i>varda</i> upon Zion.
    </li>
    <li>But they know not the thoughts of the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>nishta</i> understand they <i>her</i> counsel: for <i>she</i> shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor.
    </li>
    <li>Arise and thresh, O <i>palone chavvie</i> of Zion: for I will make thine <i>colin</i> iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt <i>zsa zsa-ed</i> in pieces many <i>homies and palones</i>: and I will consecrate their gain unto the <i>Duchess</i>, and their substance unto the <i>Duchess</i> of the whole earth.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now gather thyself in troops, O <i>palone chavvie</i> of troops: <i>she</i> hath <i>laued</i> siege against us: they shall <i>slap</i> the <i>beak</i> of Israel with a rod upon the cheek.
    </li>
    <li>But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be <i>bijou</i> among the <i>milles</i> of Judah, yet out of thee shall <i>she</i> <i>troll</i> forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of <i>badge</i>, from everlasting.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore will <i>she</i> <i>parker</i> them up, until the time that she which travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i> shall return unto the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> shall stand and feed in the <i>butchness</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, in the <i>fabularity</i> of the name of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i>; and they shall <i>lett</i>: for now shall <i>she</i> be <i>dowry</i> unto the ends of the earth.
    </li>
    <li>And this <i>homie</i> shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall <i>troll</i> into our land: and when <i>she</i> shall <i>mince</i> in our <i>dowry latties</i>, then shall we raise against <i>her</i> <i>setter</i> shepherds, and <i>say dooe</i> principal <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the <i>dowry efink</i>, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall <i>she</i> deliver us from the Assyrian, when <i>she</i> <i>trolleth</i> into our land, and when <i>she</i> <i>minceth</i> within our borders.
    </li>
    <li>And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many <i>homies and palones</i> as a dew from the <i>Duchess</i>, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for <i>homie</i>, <i>nishta</i> waiteth for the <i>homie chavvies</i> of <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> in the midst of many <i>homies and palones</i> as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a <i>bean</i> lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if <i>she</i> <i>troll</i> through, both <i>minceth</i> down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.
    </li>
    <li>Thine <i>famble</i> shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off.
    </li>
    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass in that <i>journo</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will <i>battyfang</i> thy <i>rattling coves</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And I will cut off the <i>smokes</i> of thy land, and throw down all thy <i>butch</i> holds:
    </li>
    <li>And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine <i>famble</i>; and thou shalt have <i>nishta</i> soothsayers:
    </li>
    <li>Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt <i>nishta</i> worship the <i>acting dickey</i> of thine <i>fambles</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so will I <i>battyfang</i> thy <i>smokes</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And I will execute <i>the rights</i> in <i>wild</i> and fury upon the heathen, such as they have not <i>aunt nelled</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Aunt nell</i> ye now what the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackleth</i>; Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills <i>aunt nell</i> thy <i>cackling fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Aunt nell</i> ye, O mountains, the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s controversy, and ye <i>butch</i> foundations of the earth: for the <i>Duchess</i> hath a controversy with <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, and <i>she</i> will plead with Israel.
    </li>
    <li>O my <i>homies and palones</i>, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.
    </li>
    <li>For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the <i>lattie</i> of <i>serving homies</i>; and I <i>laued</i> before thee <i>Maureen</i>, Aaron, and Miriam.
    </li>
    <li>O my <i>homies and palones</i>, remember now what Balak <i>dowriest homie</i> of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Beor answered <i>her</i> from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the <i>bonaness</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherewith shall I <i>troll</i> before the <i>Duchess</i>, and bow myself before the high <i>Gloria</i>? shall I <i>troll</i> before <i>her</i> with burnt <i>parkerings</i>, with calves of a year <i>badge</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Will the <i>Duchess</i> be pleased with <i>milles</i> of rams, or with <i>dacha</i> <i>milles</i> of rivers of <i>lube</i>? shall I <i>parker</i> my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my <i>lucoddy</i> for the <i>kertever</i> of my <i>nishta lucoddy</i>?
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> hath shewed thee, O <i>homie</i>, what is <i>bona</i>; and what doth the <i>Duchess</i> require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to <i>mince</i> humbly with thy <i>Gloria</i>?
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s <i>cackling fakement</i> <i>screecheth</i> unto the <i>smoke</i>, and the <i>homie</i> of wisdom shall <i>varda</i> thy name: <i>aunt nell</i> ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.
    </li>
    <li>Are there yet the <i>gelt</i> of <i>naffness</i> in the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>naff</i>, and the scant measure that is abominable?
    </li>
    <li>Shall I count them pure with the <i>naff</i> balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?
    </li>
    <li>For the rich <i>homies</i> thereof are full of <i>slapping</i>, and the inhabitants thereof have <i>cackled</i> lies, and their <i>polari</i> is deceitful in their <i>screech</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore also will I make thee sick in smiting thee, in making thee desolate because of thy <i>kertervers</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thou shalt <i>jarry</i>, but not be satisfied; and thy <i>chucking</i> down shall be in the midst of thee; and thou shalt <i>lell</i> hold, but shalt not deliver; and that which thou deliverest will I <i>parker</i> up to the <i>dowry efink</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thou shalt sow, but <i>nishta</i> reap; thou shalt <i>mince</i> the olives, but <i>nishta</i> anoint thee with <i>lube</i>; and <i>bona</i> <i>sherry</i>, but shalt not <i>buvare</i> <i>sherry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>dowry lavs</i> of Omri are kept, and all the works of the <i>lattie</i> of Ahab, and ye <i>mince</i> in their counsels; that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to <i>jarry</i>: my <i>nishta lucoddy</i> <i>fancied</i> the firstripe fruit.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>bona</i> <i>homie</i> is perished out of the earth: and there is none upright among <i>homies</i>: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every <i>homie</i> <i>her</i> <i>sister</i> with a net.
    </li>
    <li>That they may do <i>nana</i> with both <i>fambles</i> earnestly, the <i>princess</i> asketh, and the <i>beak</i> asketh for a <i>parkering</i>; and the <i>dowry</i> <i>homie</i>, <i>she</i> uttereth <i>her</i> mischievous <i>fancy</i>: so they wrap it up.
    </li>
    <li>The best of them is as a brier: the most upright is sharper than a thorn hedge: the <i>journo</i> of thy watchmen and thy visitation <i>trolleth</i>; now shall be their perplexity.
    </li>
    <li>Trust ye not in a <i>bencove</i>, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of thy <i>screech</i> from her that <i>lettieth</i> in thy bosom.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>homie chavvie</i> dishonoureth the <i>Auntie</i>, the <i>palone chavvie</i> riseth up against her mother, the <i>palone chavvie</i> in law against her mother in law; a <i>homie</i>&#8216;s enemies are the <i>homies</i> of <i>her</i> own <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore I will <i>varda</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>; I will wait for the <i>Gloria</i> of my salvation: my <i>Gloria</i> will <i>aunt nell</i> me.
    </li>
    <li>Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I <i>lett</i> in <i>munge</i>, the <i>Duchess</i> shall be a <i>sparkle</i> unto me.
    </li>
    <li>I will bear the indignation of the <i>Duchess</i>, because I have <i>kertervered</i> against <i>her</i>, until <i>she</i> plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: <i>she</i> will <i>parker</i> me forth to the <i>sparkle</i>, and I shall <i>varda</i> <i>her</i> <i>bonaness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then she that is mine enemy shall <i>varda</i> it, and <i>scharda</i> shall cover her which <i>cackled</i> unto me, Where is the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i>? mine <i>ogles</i> shall <i>varda</i> her: now shall she be <i>minced</i> down as the mire of the streets.
    </li>
    <li>In the <i>journo</i> that thy walls are to be built, in that <i>journo</i> shall the decree be far removed.
    </li>
    <li>In that <i>journo</i> also <i>she</i> shall <i>troll</i> even to thee from Assyria, and from the fortified <i>smokes</i>, and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.
    </li>
    <li>Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that <i>lett</i> therein, for the fruit of their doings.
    </li>
    <li>Feed thy <i>homies and palones</i> with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which <i>lett</i> solitarily in the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of <i>badge</i>.
    </li>
    <li>According to the days of thy <i>trolling</i> out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto <i>her</i> marvellous <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The nations shall <i>varda</i> and be <i>bamboozled</i> at all their might: they shall <i>lett</i> their <i>famble</i> upon their <i>screech</i>, their <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> shall be <i>nanti nellyarda</i>.
    </li>
    <li>They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall <i>troll</i> out of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i>, and shall fear because of thee.
    </li>
    <li>Who is a <i>Gloria</i> like unto thee, that pardoneth <i>codness</i>, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of <i>her</i> heritage? <i>she</i> retaineth not <i>her</i> <i>wild</i> for ever, because <i>she</i> delighteth in mercy.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> will turn again, <i>she</i> will have compassion upon us; <i>she</i> will subdue our <i>cods</i>; and thou wilt cast all their <i>kertervers</i> into the depths of the sea.
    </li>
    <li>Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our <i>aunties</i> from the days of <i>badge</i>.
