    <h1>Jeremiah</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>The <i>lavs</i> of Jeremiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Hilkiah, of the <i>godly homies</i> that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:
    </li>
    <li>To whom the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> in the days of Josiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Amon <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, in the thirteenth year of <i>her</i> reign.
    </li>
    <li>It <i>trolled</i> also in the days of Jehoiakim the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Josiah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Josiah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> unto me, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> I, Ah, <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>! <i>varda</i>, I cannot <i>cackle</i>: for I am a <i>chavvie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, <i>cackle</i> not, I am a <i>chavvie</i>: for thou shalt <i>troll</i> to all that I shall <i>lau</i> thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt <i>cackle</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Be not afraid of their <i>ekes</i>: for I am with thee to deliver thee, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>Duchess</i> put forth <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>, and <i>reefed</i> my <i>screech</i>. And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, <i>varda</i>, I have put my <i>lavs</i> in thy <i>screech</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, I have this <i>journo</i> set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to <i>battyfang</i>, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> unto me, <i>cackling</i>, Jeremiah, what <i>vardest</i> thou? And I <i>cackled</i>, I <i>varda</i> a rod of an almond tree.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> the <i>Duchess</i> unto me, Thou hast well <i>vardad</i>: for I will hasten my <i>lav</i> to perform it.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> unto me the second time, <i>cackling</i>, What <i>vardest</i> thou? And I <i>cackled</i>, I <i>varda</i> a seething pot; and the <i>eke</i> thereof is toward the north.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, Out of the north an <i>nana</i> shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.
    </li>
    <li>For, lo, I will <i>screech</i> all the families of the kingdoms of the north, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>; and they shall <i>troll</i>, and they shall set every <i>una</i> <i>her</i> throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the <i>smokes</i> of Judah.
    </li>
    <li>And I will utter my judgments against them <i>reefing</i> all their <i>naffness</i>, who have forsaken me, and have burned <i>smelly</i> unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own <i>fambles</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and <i>cackle</i> unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their <i>ekes</i>, lest I <i>bamboozle</i> thee before them.
    </li>
    <li>For, <i>varda</i>, I have made thee this <i>journo</i> a defenced <i>smoke</i>, and an iron pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Judah, against the <i>princesses</i> thereof, against the <i>godly homies</i> thereof, and against the <i>homies and palones</i> of the land.
    </li>
    <li>And they shall <i>palaver</i> against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, to deliver thee.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Moreover the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> to me, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Troll</i> and <i>screech</i> in the <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> of Jerusalem, <i>cackling</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>; I remember thee, the kindness of thy <i>beandom</i>, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the <i>nishta smoke</i>, in a land that was not sown.
    </li>
    <li>Israel was holiness unto the <i>Duchess</i>, and the firstfruits of <i>her</i> increase: all that devour <i>her</i> shall offend; <i>nana</i> shall <i>troll</i> upon them, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Aunt nell</i> ye the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, O <i>lattie</i> of Jacob, and all the families of the <i>lattie</i> of Israel:
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, What <i>codness</i> have your <i>aunties</i> found in me, that they are <i>trolled</i> <i>nishter ajax</i> me, and have <i>minced</i> after <i>spangly</i>, and are become vain?
    </li>
    <li><i>Nishta</i> <i>cackled</i> they, Where is the <i>Duchess</i> that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the <i>nishta smoke</i>, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of <i>nishta parnie</i>, and of the shadow of <i>carking it</i>, through a land that no <i>homie</i> passed through, and where no <i>homie</i> <i>letted</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And I brought you into a plentiful country, to <i>jarry</i> the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made mine heritage <i>a dowriest cod</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>godly homies</i> <i>cackled</i> not, Where is the <i>Duchess</i>? and they that handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and <i>minced</i> after <i>fakements</i> that <i>nix</i> profit.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore I will yet plead with you, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, and with your <i>chavvies</i>&#8216;s <i>chavvies</i> will I plead.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>troll over</i> the isles of Chittim, and <i>varda</i>; and <i>lau</i> unto Kedar, and consider diligently, and <i>varda</i> if there be such a <i>fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my <i>homies and palones</i> have changed their <i>fabeness</i> for that which doth not profit.
    </li>
    <li>Be <i>gobsmacked</i>, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye <i>dowry</i> desolate, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For my <i>homies and palones</i> have committed <i>dewey</i> <i>nanas</i>; they have forsaken me the fountain of living <i>aquas</i>, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no <i>aqua</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Is Israel a <i>serving homie</i>? is <i>she</i> a homeborn <i>lag</i>? why is <i>she</i> spoiled?
    </li>
    <li>The <i>bean</i> lions roared upon <i>her</i>, and yelled, and they made <i>her</i> land waste: <i>her</i> <i>smokes</i> are burned <i>nanti</i> inhabitant.
    </li>
    <li>Also the <i>chavvies</i> of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the <i>mudge</i> of thy <i>eke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i>, when <i>she</i> led thee by the way?
    </li>
    <li>And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to <i>buvare</i> the <i>aquas</i> of Sihor? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria, to <i>buvare</i> the <i>aquas</i> of the river?
    </li>
    <li>Thine own <i>naffness</i> shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and <i>varda</i> that it is an <i>nana</i> <i>fakement</i> and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i>, and that my fear is not in thee, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of hosts.
    </li>
    <li>For of <i>badge</i> time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bands; and thou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest, playing the <i>charvering donna</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a <i>sweet</i> <i>maria</i>: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?
    </li>
    <li>For though thou <i>dhobie</i> thee with nitre, and <i>lell</i> thee <i>dowry</i> soap, yet thine <i>codness</i> is marked before me, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>How canst thou <i>cackle</i>, I am not <i>dingy</i>, I have not <i>trolled</i> after Baalim? <i>varda</i> thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: thou art a swift dromedary traversing her ways;
    </li>
    <li>A wild ass used to the <i>nishta smoke</i>, that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that <i>charper</i> her will not <i>a stretcher case</i> themselves; in her month they shall find her.
    </li>
    <li>Withhold thy <i>plate</i> from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst: but thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I <i>troll</i>.
    </li>
    <li>As the <i>sharpering homie</i> is ashamed when <i>she</i> is found, so is the <i>lattie</i> of Israel ashamed; they, their <i>dowriest homies</i>, their <i>princesses</i>, and their <i>godly homies</i>, and their prophets.
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackling</i> to a stock, Thou art my <i>Auntie</i>; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not their <i>eke</i>: but in the time of their trouble they will <i>cackle</i>, Arise, and save us.
    </li>
    <li>But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for according to the number of thy <i>smokes</i> are thy gods, O Judah.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed against me, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>In vain have I smitten your <i>chavvies</i>; they <i>lalled</i> no correction: your own <i>dowry efink</i> hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.
    </li>
    <li>O generation, <i>varda</i> ye the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>. Have I been a <i>nishta smoke</i> unto Israel? a land of <i>munge</i>? wherefore <i>cackle</i> my <i>homies and palones</i>, We are <i>ladies</i>; we will <i>troll</i> <i>nishta</i> unto thee?
    </li>
    <li>Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my <i>homies and palones</i> have forgotten me days <i>nanti</i> number.
    </li>
    <li>Why trimmest thou thy way to <i>charper</i> love? therefore hast thou also taught the <i>naff</i> ones thy ways.
    </li>
    <li>Also in thy <i>frocks</i> is found the blood of the <i>nishta lucoddies</i> of the <i>nanti dinarly</i> innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.
    </li>
    <li>Yet thou <i>cackleth</i>, Because I am innocent, surely <i>her</i> <i>wild</i> shall turn from me. <i>Varda</i>, I will plead with thee, because thou <i>cackleth</i>, I have not <i>kertervered</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Why gaddest thou about so <i>dowry</i> to change thy way? thou also shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, thou shalt <i>troll forth</i> from <i>her</i>, and thine <i>fambles</i> upon thine <i>eke</i>: for the <i>Duchess</i> hath rejected thy confidences, and <i>nishta</i> prosper in them.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>They <i>cackle</i>, If a <i>homie</i> put away <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>, and she <i>troll</i> from <i>her</i>, and become another <i>homie</i>&#8216;s, shall <i>she</i> return unto her again? shall not that land be greatly <i>dingy</i>? but thou hast played the <i>charvering donna</i> with many <i>affairs</i>; yet return again to me, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Lift up thine <i>ogles</i> unto the high places, and <i>varda</i> where thou hast not been lien with. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian in the <i>nishta smoke</i>; and thou hast <i>dingy</i> the land with thy <i>bitainedoms</i> and with thy <i>naffness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no latter rain; and thou hadst a <i>bitaine</i>&#8216;s forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed.
    </li>
    <li>Wilt thou not from this time <i>screech</i> unto me, My <i>Auntie</i>, thou art the guide of my <i>beandom</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Will <i>she</i> reserve <i>her</i> <i>wild</i> for ever? will <i>she</i> keep it to the end? <i>varda</i>, thou hast <i>cackled</i> and done <i>nana</i> <i>fakements</i> as thou couldest.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> also unto me in the days of Josiah the <i>dowriest homie</i>, Hast thou <i>vardad</i> that which backsliding Israel hath done? she is <i>trolled</i> up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there hath played the <i>charvering donna</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>cackled</i> after she had done all these <i>fakements</i>, Turn thou unto me. But she <i>trolled back</i> not. And her treacherous sister Judah <i>vardad</i> it.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>vardad</i>, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away, and <i>parkered</i> her a bill of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but <i>trolled</i> and played the <i>charvering donna</i> also.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> through the lightness of her <i>bitainedom</i>, that she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with stocks.
    </li>
    <li>And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned unto me with her whole <i>thumping cheat</i>, but feignedly, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, The backsliding Israel hath justified herself more than treacherous Judah.
    </li>
    <li><i>Troll</i> and proclaim these <i>lavs</i> toward the north, and <i>cackle</i>, Return, thou backsliding Israel, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>; and I will not cause mine <i>wild</i> to fall upon you: for I am merciful, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, and I will not keep <i>wild</i> for ever.
    </li>
    <li>Only acknowledge thine <i>codness</i>, that thou hast transgressed against the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i>, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed my <i>cackling fakement</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Turn, O backsliding <i>chavvies</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>; for I am married unto you: and I will <i>lell</i> you <i>una</i> of a <i>smoke</i>, and <i>dewey</i> of a family, and I will <i>parker</i> you to Zion:
    </li>
    <li>And I will <i>parker</i> you pastors according to mine <i>thumping cheat</i>, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.
    </li>
    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, when ye be multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, they shall <i>cackle</i> <i>nishta</i>, The <i>bijou arkette</i> of the covenant of the <i>Duchess</i>: <i>nishta</i> shall it <i>troll</i> to mind: <i>nishta</i> shall they remember it; <i>nishta</i> shall they visit it; <i>nishta</i> shall that be done any more.
    </li>
    <li>At that time they shall <i>screech</i> Jerusalem the throne of the <i>Duchess</i>; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the <i>Duchess</i>, to Jerusalem: <i>nishta</i> shall they <i>mince</i> any more after the imagination of their <i>nana</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li>In those days the <i>lattie</i> of Judah shall <i>mince</i> with the <i>lattie</i> of Israel, and they shall <i>troll</i> together out of the land of the north to the land that I have <i>parkered</i> for an inheritance unto your <i>aunties</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But I <i>cackled</i>, How shall I put thee among the <i>chavvies</i>, and <i>parker</i> thee a <i>dolly</i> land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations? and I <i>cackled</i>, Thou shalt <i>screech</i> me, My <i>Auntie</i>; and shalt not turn away from me.
    </li>
    <li>Surely as a <i>palone affair</i> treacherously departeth from her <i>homie affair</i>, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O <i>lattie</i> of Israel, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>A <i>cackling fakement</i> was <i>aunt nelled</i> upon the high places, weeping and supplications of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel: for they have perverted their way, and they have forgotten the <i>Duchess</i> their <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Return, ye backsliding <i>chavvies</i>, and I will heal your backslidings. <i>Varda</i>, we <i>troll</i> unto thee; for thou art the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the multitude of mountains: truly in the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i> is the salvation of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>scharda</i> hath devoured the <i>acting dickey</i> of our <i>aunties</i> from our <i>beandom</i>; their flocks and their herds, their <i>homie chavvies</i> and their <i>palone chavvies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>We lie down in our <i>scharda</i>, and our confusion covereth us: for we have <i>kertervered</i> against the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i>, we and our <i>aunties</i>, from our <i>beandom</i> even unto this <i>journo</i>, and have not obeyed the <i>cackling fakement</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>If thou wilt return, O Israel, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, return unto me: and if thou wilt put away thine <i>dowry cods</i> out of my <i>vardaing</i>, then shalt thou not remove.
    </li>
    <li>And thou shalt swear, The <i>Duchess</i> <i>letteth</i>, <i>no flies</i>, in judgment, and in <i>bonaness</i>; and the nations shall bless themselves in <i>her</i>, and in <i>her</i> shall they <i>fabeness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> to the <i>homies</i> of Judah and Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.
    </li>
    <li>Circumcise yourselves to the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>lell</i> away the foreskins of your <i>thumping cheat</i>, ye <i>homies</i> of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury <i>troll</i> forth like <i>binco fakement</i>, and burn that none can quench it, because of the <i>nana</i> of your doings.
    </li>
    <li><i>Screech</i> ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and <i>cackle</i>, Blow ye the <i>tooting fakement</i> in the land: <i>screech</i>, gather together, and <i>cackle</i>, Assemble yourselves, and let us <i>troll</i> into the defenced <i>smokes</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Set up the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not: for I will <i>parker</i> <i>nana</i> from the north, and a <i>dowry</i> destruction.
    </li>
    <li>The lion is <i>troll</i> up from <i>her</i> thicket, and the destroyer of the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> is on <i>her</i> way; <i>she</i> is <i>trolled</i> forth from <i>her</i> place to make thy land desolate; and thy <i>smokes</i> shall be <i>laued</i> waste, <i>nanti</i> an inhabitant.
    </li>
    <li>For this gird you with <i>nylon</i>, lament and howl: for the fierce <i>wild</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> is not turned back from us.
    </li>
    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass at that <i>journo</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, that the <i>thumping cheat</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> shall perish, and the <i>thumping cheat</i> of the <i>princesses</i>; and the <i>godly homies</i> shall be <i>gobsmacked</i>, and the prophets shall wonder.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> I, Ah, <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>! surely thou hast greatly <i>mogued</i> this <i>homies and palones</i> and Jerusalem, <i>cackling</i>, Ye shall have peace; whereas the <i>dowry efink</i> reacheth unto the <i>nishta lucoddy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>At that time shall it be <i>cackled</i> to this <i>homies and palones</i> and to Jerusalem, A dry wind of the high places in the <i>nishta smoke</i> toward the <i>palone chavvie</i> of my <i>homies and palones</i>, not to fan, <i>nishta</i> to cleanse,
    </li>
    <li>Even a full wind from those places shall <i>troll</i> unto me: now also will I <i>parker</i> sentence against them.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, <i>she</i> shall <i>troll</i> up as clouds, and <i>her</i> <i>rattling coves</i> shall be as a whirlwind: <i>her</i> horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are spoiled.
    </li>
    <li>O Jerusalem, <i>dhobie</i> thine <i>thumping cheat</i> from <i>naffness</i>, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?
    </li>
    <li>For a <i>cackling fakement</i> declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from mount Ephraim.
    </li>
    <li>Make ye mention to the nations; <i>varda</i>, publish against Jerusalem, that watchers <i>troll</i> from a far country, and <i>parker</i> out their <i>cackling fakement</i> against the <i>smokes</i> of Judah.
    </li>
    <li>As keepers of a field, are they against her round about; because she hath been rebellious against me, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thy way and thy doings have procured these <i>fakements</i> unto thee; this is thy <i>naffness</i>, because it is bitter, because it reacheth unto thine <i>thumping cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li>My <i>chutney locker</i>, my <i>chutney locker</i>! I am pained at my <i>dowry</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>; my <i>thumping cheat</i> maketh a <i>screech</i> in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast <i>aunt nelled</i>, O my <i>nishta lucoddy</i>, the sound of the <i>tooting fakement</i>, the alarm of <i>barney</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Destruction upon destruction is <i>screeched</i>; for the whole land is spoiled: suddenly are my <i>trolling letties</i> spoiled, and my curtains in a moment.
    </li>
    <li>How long shall I <i>varda</i> the standard, and <i>aunt nell</i> the sound of the <i>tooting fakement</i>?
    </li>
    <li>For my <i>homies and palones</i> is <i>dizzy</i>, they have not known me; they are sottish <i>chavvies</i>, and they have none understanding: they are wise to do <i>nana</i>, but to do <i>bona</i> they have no knowledge.
    </li>
    <li>I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was <i>nanti</i> form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no <i>sparkle</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills <i>trolled</i> lightly.
    </li>
    <li>I beheld, and, lo, there was no <i>homie</i>, and all the birds of the heavens were fled.
    </li>
    <li>I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a <i>nishta smoke</i>, and all the <i>smokes</i> thereof were broken down at the presence of the <i>Duchess</i>, and by <i>her</i> fierce <i>wild</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For thus hath the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i>, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end.
    </li>
    <li>For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be <i>goolie</i>; because I have <i>cackled</i> it, I have purposed it, and will not repent, <i>nishta</i> will I turn back from it.
    </li>
    <li>The whole <i>smoke</i> shall <i>scarper</i> for the <i>screech</i> of the horsemen and bowmen; they shall <i>troll</i> into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every <i>smoke</i> shall be forsaken, and not a <i>homie</i> <i>lett</i> therein.
    </li>
    <li>And when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of <i>gelt</i>, though thou rentest thy <i>eke</i> with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself <i>filly</i>; thy <i>affairs</i> will despise thee, they will <i>charper</i> thy life.
    </li>
    <li>For I have <i>aunt nelled</i> a <i>cackling fakement</i> as of a <i>palone</i> in travail, and the anguish as of her that <i>parkereth</i> forth her first <i>chavvie</i>, the <i>cackling fakement</i> of the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Zion, that bewaileth herself, that spreadeth her <i>fambles</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Woe is me now! for my <i>nishta lucoddy</i> is wearied because of murderers.

    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and <i>varda</i> now, and know, and <i>charper</i> in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a <i>homie</i>, if there be any that executeth judgment, that <i>charpereth</i> the truth; and I will pardon it.
    </li>
    <li>And though they <i>cackle</i>, The <i>Duchess</i> <i>letteth</i>; surely they swear falsely.
    </li>
    <li>O <i>Duchess</i>, are not thine <i>ogles</i> upon the truth? thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, but they have refused to <i>lall</i> correction: they have made their <i>ekes</i> harder than a rock; they have refused to return.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore I <i>cackled</i>, Surely these are <i>nanti dinarly</i>; they are <i>dizzy</i>: for they know not the way of the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>nishta</i> the judgment of their <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I will get me unto the <i>dowry</i> <i>homies</i>, and will <i>cackle</i> unto them; for they have known the way of the <i>Duchess</i>, and the judgment of their <i>Gloria</i>: but these have altogether broken the yoke, and burst the bonds.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall <i>ferricadooza</i> them, and a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall <i>varda</i> over their <i>smokes</i>: every <i>una</i> that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces: because their transgressions are many, and their backslidings are increased.
    </li>
    <li>How shall I pardon thee for this? thy <i>chavvies</i> have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the <i>charvering donnas</i>&#8216; <i>latties</i>.
    </li>
    <li>They were as fed horses in the morning: every <i>una</i> neighed after <i>her</i> <i>homie ajax</i>&#8216;s <i>palone affair</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Shall I not visit for these <i>fakements</i>? <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>: and shall not my <i>nishta lucoddy</i> be avenged on such a nation as this?
    </li>
    <li><i>Troll</i> ye up upon her walls, and <i>battyfang</i>; but make not a full end: <i>lell</i> away her battlements; for they are not the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>lattie</i> of Israel and the <i>lattie</i> of Judah have dealt <i>dowry</i> treacherously against me, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>They have belied the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, It is not <i>she</i>; <i>nishta</i> shall <i>nana</i> <i>troll</i> upon us; <i>nishta</i> shall we <i>varda</i> <i>dowry efink</i> <i>nishta</i> <i>nix munjarlee</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And the prophets shall become wind, and the <i>lav</i> is not in them: thus shall it be done unto them.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of hosts, Because ye <i>cackle</i> this <i>lav</i>, <i>varda</i>, I will make my <i>lavs</i> in thy <i>screech</i> <i>binco fakement</i>, and this <i>homies and palones</i> wood, and it shall devour them.
    </li>
    <li>Lo, I will <i>parker</i> a nation upon you from far, O <i>lattie</i> of Israel, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>: it is a <i>dowry butch</i> nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not, <i>nishta</i> understandest what they <i>cackle</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Their quiver is as an open sepulchre, they are all <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they shall <i>jarry</i> up thine harvest, and thy <i>pannan</i>, which thy <i>homie chavvies</i> and thy <i>palone chavvies</i> should <i>jarry</i>: they shall <i>jarry</i> up thy flocks and thine herds: they shall <i>jarry</i> up thy vines and thy fig trees: they shall impoverish thy fenced <i>smokes</i>, wherein thou trustedst, with the <i>dowry efink</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> in those days, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, I will not make a full end with you.
    </li>
    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, when ye shall <i>cackle</i>, Wherefore doeth the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i> all these <i>fakements</i> unto us? then shalt thou answer them, Like as ye have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not your&#8217;s.
    </li>
    <li><i>Screech</i> this in the <i>lattie</i> of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, <i>cackling</i>,

    <li><i>Aunt nell</i> now this, O <i>dizzy</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, and <i>nanti</i> understanding; which have <i>ogles</i>, and <i>varda</i> not; which have <i>aunt nelly cheats</i>, and <i>aunt nell</i> not:
    </li>
    <li>Fear ye not me? <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>: will ye not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they <i>butch shriek</i>, yet can they not <i>troll over</i> it?
    </li>
    <li>But this <i>homies and palones</i> hath a revolting and a rebellious <i>thumping cheat</i>; they are revolted and <i>trolled</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Nishta</i> <i>cackle</i> they in their <i>thumping cheat</i>, Let us now fear the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i>, that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in <i>her</i> season: <i>she</i> reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest.
    </li>
    <li>Your <i>cods</i> have turned away these <i>fakements</i>, and your <i>kertervers</i> have withholden <i>bona</i> <i>fakements</i> from you.
    </li>
    <li>For among my <i>homies and palones</i> are found <i>naff</i> <i>homies</i>: they <i>lett</i> wait, as <i>she</i> that setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>As a cage is full of birds, so are their <i>latties</i> full of deceit: therefore they are become <i>dowry</i>, and waxen rich.
    </li>
    <li>They are waxen fat, they shine: <i>any road up</i>, they overpass the deeds of the <i>naff</i>: they <i>beak</i> not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper; and the <i>sweet</i> of the needy do they not <i>beak</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Shall I not visit for these <i>fakements</i>? <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>: shall not my <i>nishta lucoddy</i> be avenged on such a nation as this?
    </li>
    <li>A <i>fortuni</i> and horrible <i>fakement</i> is committed in the land;
    </li>
    <li>The prophets prophesy falsely, and the <i>godly homies</i> bear rule by their means; and my <i>homies and palones</i> love to have it so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?

    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>O ye <i>chavvies</i> of Benjamin, gather yourselves to <i>scarper</i> out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the <i>tooting fakement</i> in Tekoa, and set up a sign of <i>binco fakement</i> in Bethhaccerem: for <i>nana</i> appeareth out of the north, and <i>dowry</i> destruction.
    </li>
    <li>I have likened the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Zion to a comely and delicate <i>palone</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The shepherds with their flocks shall <i>troll</i> unto her; they shall pitch their <i>trolling letties</i> against her round about; they shall feed every <i>una</i> in <i>her</i> place.
    </li>
    <li>Prepare ye <i>barney</i> against her; arise, and let us <i>troll</i> up at noon. Woe unto us! for the <i>journo</i> goeth away, for the shadows of the <i>bijou nochy</i> are stretched out.
    </li>
    <li>Arise, and let us <i>troll</i> by <i>nochy</i>, and let us <i>battyfang</i> her <i>dowry latties</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For thus hath the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts <i>cackled</i>, Hew ye down trees, and cast a mount against Jerusalem: this is the <i>smoke</i> to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.
    </li>
    <li>As a fountain casteth out her <i>aquas</i>, so she casteth out her <i>naffness</i>: <i>slapping</i> and spoil is <i>aunt nelled</i> in her; before me continually is grief and wounds.
    </li>
    <li>Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my <i>nishta lucoddy</i> <i>troll off</i> from thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts, They shall throughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn back thine <i>famble</i> as a grapegatherer into the baskets.
    </li>
    <li>To whom shall I <i>cackle</i>, and <i>parker</i> warning, that they may <i>aunt nell</i>? <i>varda</i>, their <i>aunt nelling cheat</i> is <i>cavalier</i>, and they cannot <i>aunt nell</i>: <i>varda</i>, the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> is unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore I am full of the fury of the <i>Duchess</i>; I am <i>a stretcher case</i> with holding in: I will pour it out upon the <i>chavvies</i> abroad, and upon the assembly of <i>bean coves</i> together: for even the <i>homie affair</i> with the <i>palone affair</i> shall be <i>lelled</i>, the aged with <i>her</i> that is full of days.
    </li>
    <li>And their <i>latties</i> shall be turned unto others, with their fields and <i>palone affairs</i> together: for I will stretch out my <i>famble</i> upon the inhabitants of the land, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For from the <i>nanti dowriest</i> of them even unto the <i>dowriest</i> of them every <i>una</i> is <i>parkered</i> to <i>ogling</i>; and from the prophet even unto the <i>godly homie</i> every <i>una</i> dealeth falsely.
    </li>
    <li>They have healed also the hurt of the <i>palone chavvie</i> of my <i>homies and palones</i> slightly, <i>cackling</i>, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.
    </li>
    <li>Were they ashamed when they had committed <i>dowry cod</i>? nay, they were not at all ashamed, <i>nishta</i> could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, Stand ye in the ways, and <i>varda</i>, and ask for the <i>badge</i> paths, where is the <i>bona</i> way, and <i>mince</i> therein, and ye shall find <i>lettie</i> for your <i>nishta lucoddies</i>. But they <i>cackled</i>, We will not <i>mince</i> therein.
    </li>
    <li>Also I set watchmen over you, <i>cackling</i>, <i>aunt nell</i> to the sound of the <i>tooting fakement</i>. But they <i>cackled</i>, We will not <i>aunt nell</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore <i>aunt nell</i>, ye nations, and know, O <i>punters</i>, what is among them.
    </li>
    <li><i>Aunt nell</i>, O earth: <i>varda</i>, I will <i>parker</i> <i>nana</i> upon this <i>homies and palones</i>, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not <i>aunt nelled</i> unto my <i>lavs</i>, <i>nishta</i> to my law, but rejected it.
    </li>
    <li>To what purpose <i>trolleth</i> there to me <i>smelly</i> from Sheba, and the <i>bona</i> cane from a far country? your burnt <i>parkerings</i> are not acceptable, <i>nishta</i> your <i>parkers</i> <i>bona</i> unto me.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>varda</i>, I will <i>lett</i> stumblingblocks before this <i>homies and palones</i>, and the <i>aunties</i> and the <i>homie chavvies</i> together shall fall upon them; the <i>homie ajax</i> and <i>her</i> <i>bencove</i> shall perish.
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>varda</i>, a <i>homies and palones</i> <i>trolleth</i> from the north country, and a <i>dowry</i> nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth.
    </li>
    <li>They shall <i>lett</i> hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their <i>cackling fakement</i> roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, set in array as <i>homies</i> for <i>barney</i> against thee, O <i>palone chavvie</i> of Zion.
    </li>
    <li>We have <i>aunt nelled</i> the fame thereof: our <i>fambles</i> wax feeble: anguish hath <i>lelled</i> hold of us, and pain, as of a <i>palone</i> in travail.
    </li>
    <li><i>Troll not</i> forth into the field, <i>nishta</i> <i>mince</i> by the way; for the <i>dowry efink</i> of the enemy and fear is on every side.
    </li>
    <li>O <i>palone chavvie</i> of my <i>homies and palones</i>, gird thee with <i>nylon</i>, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, as for an only <i>homie chavvie</i>, most bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly <i>troll</i> upon us.
    </li>
    <li>I have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my <i>homies and palones</i>, that thou mayest know and try their way.
    </li>
    <li>They are all <i>naff</i> revolters, <i>mincing</i> with slanders: they are brass and iron; they are all corrupters.
    </li>
    <li>The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the <i>binco fakement</i>; the founder melteth in vain: for the <i>naff</i> are not plucked away.
    </li>
    <li>Reprobate silver shall <i>homies</i> <i>screech</i> them, because the <i>Duchess</i> hath rejected them.

    <li>Is this <i>lattie</i>, which is <i>screeched</i> by my name, become a den of robbers in your <i>ogles</i>? <i>varda</i>, even I have <i>vardad</i> it, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.

    <li>But <i>troll</i> ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and <i>varda</i> what I did to it for the <i>naffness</i> of my <i>homies and palones</i> Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And now, because ye have done all these works, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, and I <i>cackled</i> unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye <i>aunt nelled</i> not; and I <i>screeched</i> you, but ye answered not;
    </li>
    <li>Therefore will I do unto this <i>lattie</i>, which is <i>screeched</i> by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I <i>parkered</i> to you and to your <i>aunties</i>, as I have done to Shiloh.
    </li>
    <li>And I will cast you out of my <i>vardaing</i>, as I have cast out all your <i>sisters</i>, even the whole <i>maria</i> of Ephraim.

    <li>The <i>chavvies</i> gather wood, and the <i>aunties</i> kindle the <i>binco fakement</i>, and the <i>palones</i> knead their dough, to make cakes to the <i>dowriest palone</i> of heaven, and to pour out <i>buvare</i> <i>parkerings</i> unto other gods, that they may provoke me to <i>wild</i>.

    <li>Do they provoke me to <i>wild</i>? <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>: do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own <i>ekes</i>?

    <li>Therefore thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>; <i>varda</i>, mine <i>wild</i> and my fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon <i>homie</i>, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.

    <li>But they <i>aunt nelled</i> not, <i>nishta</i> inclined their <i>aunt nelling cheat</i>, but <i>minced</i> in the counsels and in the imagination of their <i>nana</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>, and <i>trolled</i> backward, and not forward.
    </li>
    <li>Since the <i>journo</i> that your <i>aunties</i> <i>trolled</i> forth out of the land of Egypt unto this <i>journo</i> I have even <i>laued</i> unto you all my <i>serving homies</i> the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them:

    <li>Yet they <i>aunt nelled</i> not unto me, <i>nishta</i> inclined their <i>aunt nelling cheat</i>, but hardened their neck: they did worse than their <i>aunties</i>.

    <li>Cut off thine <i>riah</i>, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and <i>lell</i> up a lamentation on high places; for the <i>Duchess</i> hath rejected and forsaken the generation of <i>her</i> wrath.

    </li>
    <li>And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Hinnom, to burn their <i>homie chavvies</i> and their <i>palone chavvies</i> in the <i>binco fakement</i>; which I commanded them not, <i>nishta</i> <i>trolled</i> it into my <i>thumping cheat</i>.

    <li>Therefore will I <i>parker</i> their <i>palone affairs</i> unto others, and their fields to them that shall inherit them: for every <i>una</i> from the <i>nanti dowriest</i> even unto the <i>dowriest</i> is <i>parkered</i> to <i>ogling</i>, from the prophet even unto the <i>godly homie</i> every <i>una</i> dealeth falsely.

    <li>Why do we <i>lett</i> still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the defenced <i>smokes</i>, and let us be silent there: for the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i> hath put us to <i>nishta cackle</i>, and <i>parkered</i> us <i>aqua</i> of gall to <i>buvare</i>, because we have <i>kertervered</i> against the <i>Duchess</i>.

    <li><i>Varda</i> the <i>cackling fakement</i> of the <i>screech</i> of the <i>palone chavvie</i> of my <i>homies and palones</i> because of them that <i>lett</i> in a far country: Is not the <i>Duchess</i> in Zion? is not her <i>dowriest homie</i> in her?

    <li>The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.

    <li>For the hurt of the <i>palone chavvie</i> of my <i>homies and palones</i> am I hurt; I am <i>goolie</i>; <i>gobsmacked-ness</i> hath <i>lelled</i> hold on me.

    <li>Oh that my <i>eke</i> were <i>aquas</i>, and mine <i>ogles</i> a fountain of tears, that I might <i>parnie</i> <i>journo</i> and <i>nochy</i> for the <i>ferricadoozed</i> of the <i>palone chavvie</i> of my <i>homies and palones</i>!
    </li>
    <li>Oh that I had in the <i>nishta smoke</i> a lodging place of wayfaring <i>homies</i>; that I might leave my <i>homies and palones</i>, and <i>troll</i> from them! for they be all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they bend their <i>polaris</i> like their bow for lies: but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from <i>nana</i> to <i>nana</i>, and they know not me, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Lell</i> ye heed every <i>una</i> of <i>her</i> <i>homie ajax</i>, and trust ye not in any <i>sister</i>: for every <i>sister</i> will utterly supplant, and every <i>homie ajax</i> will <i>mince</i> with slanders.

    <li>And they will <i>mogue</i> every <i>una</i> <i>her</i> <i>homie ajax</i>, and will not <i>cackle</i> the truth: they have taught their <i>polari</i> to <i>cackle</i> lies, and <i>a stretcher case</i> themselves to commit <i>codness</i>.

    <li>Thine habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.

    <li>Therefore thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts, <i>varda</i>, I will melt them, and try them; for how shall I do for the <i>palone chavvie</i> of my <i>homies and palones</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Their <i>polari</i> is as an arrow shot out; it <i>cackleth</i> deceit: <i>una</i> <i>cackleth</i> peaceably to <i>her</i> <i>homie ajax</i> with <i>her</i> <i>screech</i>, but in <i>thumping cheat</i> <i>she</i> layeth <i>her</i> wait.

    <li>Shall I not visit them for these <i>fakements</i>? <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>: shall not my <i>nishta lucoddy</i> be avenged on such a nation as this?
    </li>
    <li>For the mountains will I <i>lell</i> up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the <i>nishta smoke</i> a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pass through them; <i>nishta</i> can <i>homies</i> <i>aunt nell</i> the <i>cackling fakement</i> of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they are <i>trolled</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And I will make Jerusalem heaps, and a den of <i>drag queens</i>; and I will make the <i>smokes</i> of Judah desolate, <i>nanti</i> an inhabitant.

    <li>Who is the wise <i>homie</i>, that may understand this? and who is <i>she</i> to whom the <i>screech</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>cackled</i>, that <i>she</i> may <i>screech</i> it, for what the land perisheth and is burned up like a <i>nishta smoke</i>, that none passeth through?

    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackleth</i>, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my <i>cackling fakement</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>minced</i> therein;

    <li>But have <i>minced</i> after the imagination of their own <i>thumping cheat</i>, and after Baalim, which their <i>aunties</i> taught them:

    <li>Therefore thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts, the <i>Gloria</i> of Israel; <i>varda</i>, I will feed them, even this <i>homies and palones</i>, with wormwood, and <i>parker</i> them <i>aqua</i> of gall to <i>buvare</i>.

    <li>I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom <i>nishta</i> they <i>nishta</i> their <i>aunties</i> have known: and I will <i>lau</i> a <i>dowry efink</i> after them, till I have consumed them.
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts, Consider ye, and <i>screech</i> for the mourning <i>palones</i>, that they may <i>troll</i>; and <i>lau</i> for cunning <i>palones</i>, that they may <i>troll</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And let them make haste, and <i>lell</i> up a wailing for us, that our <i>ogles</i> may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with <i>aquas</i>.

    <li>For a <i>cackling fakement</i> of wailing is <i>aunt nelled</i> out of Zion, How are we spoiled! we are greatly <i>bamboozled</i>, because we have forsaken the land, because our dwellings have cast us out.

    <li><i>Cackle</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, Even the carcases of <i>homies</i> shall fall as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman, and none shall gather them.

    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.
    </li>
    <li>For the customs of the <i>homies and palones</i> are vain: for <i>una</i> cutteth a tree out of the forest, the <i>acting dickey</i> of the <i>fambles</i> of the workman, with the axe.
    </li>
    <li>They deck it with silver and with <i>gelt</i>; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it <i>troll</i> not.
    </li>
    <li>They are upright as the palm tree, but <i>cackle</i> not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot <i>troll</i>. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do <i>nana</i>, <i>nishta</i> also is it in them to do <i>bona</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O <i>Duchess</i>; thou art <i>dowry</i>, and thy name is <i>dowry</i> in might.
    </li>
    <li>Who would not fear thee, O <i>dowriest homie</i> of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise <i>homies</i> of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.
    </li>
    <li>But they are altogether brutish and <i>dizzy</i>: the stock is a doctrine of <i>spanglies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and <i>gelt</i> from Uphaz, the <i>acting dickey</i> of the workman, and of the <i>fambles</i> of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the <i>acting dickey</i> of cunning <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>Duchess</i> is the true <i>Gloria</i>, <i>she</i> is the living <i>Gloria</i>, and an everlasting <i>dowriest homie</i>: at <i>her</i> wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to <i>lett</i> <i>her</i> indignation.

    <li>Thus shall ye <i>cackle</i> unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> hath made the earth by <i>her</i> power, <i>she</i> hath established the world by <i>her</i> wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by <i>her</i> discretion.
    </li>
    <li>When <i>she</i> uttereth <i>her</i> <i>cackling fakement</i>, there is a multitude of <i>aquas</i> in the heavens, and <i>she</i> causeth the vapours to <i>troll up</i> from the ends of the earth; <i>she</i> maketh lightnings with rain, and <i>parkereth</i> forth the wind out of <i>her</i> <i>gelt</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Every <i>homie</i> is brutish in <i>her</i> knowledge: every founder is <i>bamboozled</i> by the graven image: for <i>her</i> molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.
    </li>
    <li>They are <i>spangly</i>, and the <i>acting dickey</i> of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.

    <li>The portion of Jacob is not like them: for <i>she</i> is the former of all <i>fakements</i>; and Israel is the rod of <i>her</i> inheritance: The <i>Duchess</i> of hosts is <i>her</i> name.
    </li>
    <li>Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress.
    </li>
    <li>For thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>varda</i>, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find it so.

    <li>Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is <i>naff</i>; but I <i>cackled</i>, Truly this is a grief, and I must bear it.
    </li>
    <li>My <i>bijou tabernaclette</i> is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my <i>chavvies</i> are <i>trolled</i> forth of me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my <i>trolling lettie</i> any more, and to set up my curtains.

    <li>For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the <i>Duchess</i>: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, the <i>screech</i> of the bruit is <i>troll</i>, and a <i>dowry</i> commotion out of the north country, to make the <i>smokes</i> of Judah desolate, and a den of <i>drag queens</i>.

    <li>O <i>Duchess</i>, I know that the way of <i>homie</i> is not in himself: it is not in <i>homie</i> that <i>minceth</i> to direct <i>her</i> steps.

    <li>O <i>Duchess</i>, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine <i>wild</i>, lest thou <i>parker</i> me to <i>nishter</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that <i>screech</i> not on thy name: for they have <i>jarried</i> up Jacob, and devoured <i>her</i>, and consumed <i>her</i>, and have made <i>her</i> habitation desolate.

    <li>But if ye will not <i>aunt nell</i> it, my <i>nishta lucoddy</i> shall <i>parnie</i> in secret places for your pride; and mine <i>ogle</i> shall <i>parnie</i> sore, and run down with tears, because the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s flock is <i>lelled</i> away captive.

    <li><i>Cackle</i> unto the <i>dowriest homie</i> and to the <i>dowriest palone</i>, Humble yourselves, <i>lett</i> down: for your principalities shall <i>troll</i> down, even the <i>mudge</i> of your <i>fabeness</i>.

    <li>The <i>smokes</i> of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open them: Judah shall be <i>lelled</i> away captive all of it, it shall be wholly <i>lelled</i> away captive.

    <li>And if thou <i>cackle</i> in thine <i>thumping cheat</i>, Wherefore <i>troll</i> these <i>fakements</i> upon me? For the <i>dowriness</i> of thine <i>codness</i> are thy <i>frocks</i> discovered, and thy heels made bare.

    <li>The <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> that <i>trolled</i> to Jeremiah concerning the dearth.
    </li>
    <li>Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are <i>goolie</i> unto the ground; and the <i>screech</i> of Jerusalem is <i>trolled</i> up.
    </li>
    <li>And their nobles have <i>laued</i> their <i>bijou</i> ones to the <i>aquas</i>: they <i>trolled</i> to the pits, and found no <i>aqua</i>; they <i>trolled back</i> with their <i>fakements</i> empty; they were ashamed and <i>bamboozled</i>, and covered their <i>ekes</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their <i>ekes</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook it, because there was no grass.
    </li>
    <li>And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like <i>drag queens</i>; their <i>ogles</i> did fail, because there was no grass.
    </li>
    <li>O <i>Duchess</i>, though our <i>cods</i> testify against us, do thou it for thy name&#8217;s sake: for our backslidings are many; we have <i>kertervered</i> against thee.
    </li>
    <li>O the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring <i>homie</i> that turneth aside to tarry for a <i>nochy</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Why shouldest thou be as a <i>homie</i> astonied, as a <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homie</i> that cannot save? yet thou, O <i>Duchess</i>, art in the midst of us, and we are <i>screeched</i> by thy name; leave us not.
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> unto this <i>homies and palones</i>, Thus have they loved to <i>troll</i>, they have not refrained their <i>plates</i>, therefore the <i>Duchess</i> doth not accept them; <i>she</i> will now remember their <i>codness</i>, and visit their <i>kertervers</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> the <i>Duchess</i> unto me, Pray not for this <i>homies and palones</i> for their <i>bona</i>.
    </li>
    <li>When they <i>nishta manjarry</i>, I will not <i>aunt nell</i> their <i>screech</i>; and when they offer burnt <i>parkering</i> and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the <i>dowry efink</i>, and by the <i>nix munjarlee</i>, and by the <i>bad style</i>.

    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> I, Ah, <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>! <i>varda</i>, the prophets <i>cackle</i> unto them, <i>nanti</i> <i>varda</i> the <i>dowry efink</i>, <i>nishta</i> shall ye have <i>nix munjarlee</i>; but I will <i>parker</i> you assured peace in this place.

    <li>Then the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I <i>laued</i> them not, <i>nishta</i> have I commanded them, <i>nishta</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them: they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a <i>fakement</i> of nought, and the deceit of their <i>thumping cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I <i>laued</i> them not, yet they <i>cackle</i>, <i>dowry efink</i> and <i>nix munjarlee</i> shall not be in this land; By <i>dowry efink</i> and <i>nix munjarlee</i> shall those prophets be consumed.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>homies and palones</i> to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the <i>nix munjarlee</i> and the <i>dowry efink</i>; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their <i>palone affairs</i>, <i>nishta</i> their <i>homie chavvies</i>, <i>nishta</i> their <i>palone chavvies</i>: for I will pour their <i>naffness</i> upon them.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore thou shalt <i>cackle</i> this <i>lav</i> unto them; Let mine <i>ogles</i> run down with tears <i>nochy</i> and <i>journo</i>, and let them not cease: for the <i>nanti charver</i> <i>palone chavvie</i> of my <i>homies and palones</i> is broken with a <i>dowry</i> breach, with a <i>dowry</i> <i>naff</i> blow.
    </li>
    <li>If I <i>troll forth</i> into the field, then <i>varda</i> the <i>ferricadoozed</i> with the <i>dowry efink</i>! and if I enter into the <i>smoke</i>, then <i>varda</i> them that are sick with <i>nix munjarlee</i>! <i>any road up</i>, both the prophet and the <i>godly homie</i> <i>troll about</i> into a land that they know not.
    </li>
    <li>Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy <i>nishta lucoddy</i> lothed Zion? why hast thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us? we looked for peace, and there is no <i>bona</i>; and for the time of healing, and <i>varda</i> trouble!
    </li>
    <li>We acknowledge, O <i>Duchess</i>, our <i>naffness</i>, and the <i>codness</i> of our <i>aunties</i>: for we have <i>kertervered</i> against thee.
    </li>
    <li><i>Nix</i> abhor us, for thy name&#8217;s sake, <i>nix</i> disgrace the throne of thy <i>fabeness</i>: remember, break not thy covenant with us.

    <li>Are there any among the <i>spanglies</i> of the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> that can cause rain? or can the heavens <i>parker</i> showers? art not thou <i>she</i>, O <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i>? therefore we will wait upon thee: for thou hast made all these <i>fakements</i>.

    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, if they <i>cackle</i> unto thee, Whither shall we <i>troll forth</i>? then thou shalt <i>cackle</i> them, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>; Such as are for <i>carking it</i>, to <i>carking it</i>; and such as are for the <i>dowry efink</i>, to the <i>dowry efink</i>; and such as are for the <i>nix munjarlee</i>, to the <i>nix munjarlee</i>; and such as are for the captivity, to the captivity.
    </li>
    <li>And I will appoint over them <i>quarter</i> kinds, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>: the <i>dowry efink</i> to <i>ferricadooza</i>, and the <i>women who are not conventionally attractive</i> to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and <i>battyfang</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Hezekiah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, for that which <i>she</i> did in Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan thee? or who shall <i>troll</i> aside to ask how thou doest?
    </li>
    <li>Thou hast forsaken me, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, thou art <i>trolled</i> backward: therefore will I stretch out my <i>famble</i> against thee, and <i>battyfang</i> thee; I am <i>a stretcher case</i> with repenting.

    <li>And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will bereave them of <i>chavvies</i>, I will <i>battyfang</i> my <i>homies and palones</i> since they return not from their ways.
    </li>
    <li>Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them against the mother of the <i>bean coves</i> a spoiler at noonday: I have caused <i>her</i> to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors upon the <i>smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>She that hath borne <i>setter</i> languisheth: she hath <i>parkered</i> up the <i>fairy</i>; her sun is <i>trolled</i> down while it was yet <i>journo</i>: she hath been ashamed and <i>bamboozled</i>: and the residue of them will I deliver to the <i>dowry efink</i> before their enemies, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a <i>homie</i> of strife and a <i>homie</i> of contention to the whole earth! I have <i>nishta</i> lent on usury, <i>nishta</i> <i>homies</i> have lent to me on usury; yet every <i>una</i> of them doth curse me.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i>, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of <i>nana</i> and in the time of affliction.
    </li>
    <li>Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel?
    </li>
    <li>Thy substance and thy <i>gelt</i> will I <i>parker</i> to the spoil <i>nanti</i> price, and that for all thy <i>kertervers</i>, even in all thy borders.
    </li>
    <li>And I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not: for a <i>binco fakement</i> is kindled in mine <i>wild</i>, which shall burn upon you.
    </li>
    <li>O <i>Duchess</i>, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me of my persecutors; <i>lell</i> me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke.
    </li>
    <li>Thy <i>lavs</i> were found, and I did <i>jarry</i> them; and thy <i>lav</i> was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine <i>thumping cheat</i>: for I am <i>screeched</i> by thy name, O <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of hosts.
    </li>
    <li>I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, <i>nishta</i> rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy <i>famble</i>: for thou hast filled me with indignation.
    </li>
    <li>Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar, and as <i>aquas</i> that fail?
    </li>
    <li>Therefore thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, If thou return, then will I <i>parker</i> thee again, and thou shalt stand before me: and if thou <i>lell</i> forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my <i>screech</i>: let them return unto thee; but return not thou unto them.
    </li>
    <li>And I will make thee unto this <i>homies and palones</i> a fenced brasen wall: and they shall <i>palaver</i> against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.

    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, when thou shalt shew this <i>homies and palones</i> all these <i>lavs</i>, and they shall <i>cackle</i> unto thee, Wherefore hath the <i>Duchess</i> pronounced all this <i>dowry</i> <i>nana</i> against us? or what is our <i>codness</i>? or what is our <i>kertever</i> that we have committed against the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i>?

    <li>At what instant I shall <i>cackle</i> concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to <i>battyfang</i> it;

    <li>If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their <i>nana</i>, I will repent of the <i>nana</i> that I thought to do unto them.

    <li>Now therefore <i>troll</i> to, <i>cackle</i> to the <i>homies</i> of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, <i>cackling</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>; <i>varda</i>, I frame <i>nana</i> against you, and devise a device against you: return ye now every <i>una</i> from <i>her</i> <i>nana</i> way, and make your ways and your doings <i>bona</i>.

    <li>And they <i>cackled</i>, There is no hope: but we will <i>mince</i> after our own devices, and we will every <i>una</i> do the imagination of <i>her</i> <i>nana</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>.

    <li>Therefore thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>; Ask ye now among the heathen, who hath <i>aunt nelled</i> such <i>fakements</i>: the <i>nanti charver</i> of Israel hath done a <i>dowry</i> horrible <i>fakement</i>.

    <li>Will a <i>homie</i> leave the snow of Lebanon which <i>trolleth</i> from the rock of the field? or shall the cold flowing <i>aquas</i> that <i>troll</i> from another place be forsaken?
    </li>
    <li>Because my <i>homies and palones</i> hath forgotten me, they have burned <i>smelly</i> to <i>spangly</i>, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths, to <i>mince</i> in paths, in a way not cast up;

    <li>I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will shew them the back, and not the <i>eke</i>, in the <i>journo</i> of their calamity.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> they, <i>troll</i> and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the <i>godly homie</i>, <i>nishta</i> counsel from the wise, <i>nishta</i> the <i>lav</i> from the prophet. <i>Troll</i>, and let us <i>slap</i> <i>her</i> with the <i>polari</i>, and let us not <i>parker</i> heed to any of <i>her</i> <i>lavs</i>.

    <li>Therefore deliver up their <i>chavvies</i> to the <i>nix munjarlee</i>, and pour out their blood by the force of the <i>dowry efink</i>; and let their <i>palone affairs</i> be bereaved of their <i>chavvies</i>, and be widows; and let their <i>homies</i> be put to <i>carking it</i>; let their <i>bean coves</i> be <i>ferricadoozed</i> by the <i>dowry efink</i> in battle.

    <li>And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the <i>dowry efink</i> before their enemies, and by the <i>fambles</i> of them that <i>charper</i> their lives: and their carcases will I <i>parker</i> to be <i>carnish</i> for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.

    <li>And I will make this <i>smoke</i> desolate, and an hissing; every <i>una</i> that passeth thereby shall be <i>gobsmacked</i> and hiss because of all the plagues thereof.

    <li>Then shalt thou break the <i>schooner</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>homies</i> that <i>troll</i> with thee,

    <li>And shalt <i>cackle</i> unto them, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts; Even so will I break this <i>homies and palones</i> and this <i>smoke</i>, as <i>una</i> breaketh a potter&#8217;s <i>fakement</i>, that cannot be made whole again: and they shall bury them in Tophet, till there be no place to bury.
    </li>
    <li>Thus will I do unto this place, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, and to the inhabitants thereof, and even make this <i>smoke</i> as Tophet:

    <li>And the <i>latties</i> of Jerusalem, and the <i>latties</i> of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Judah, shall be defiled as the place of Tophet, because of all the <i>latties</i> upon whose roofs they have burned <i>smelly</i> unto all the host of heaven, and have poured out <i>buvare</i> <i>parkerings</i> unto other gods.

    <li>For thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>varda</i>, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy <i>bencoves</i>: and they shall fall by the <i>dowry efink</i> of their enemies, and thine <i>ogles</i> shall <i>varda</i> it: and I will <i>parker</i> all Judah into the <i>famble</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon, and <i>she</i> shall carry them captive into Babylon, and shall <i>ferricadooza</i> them with the <i>dowry efink</i>.

    <li>O <i>Duchess</i>, thou hast <i>mogued</i> me, and I was <i>mogued</i>; thou art <i>butcher</i> than I, and hast prevailed: I am in derision daily, every <i>una</i> mocketh me.

    <li>For I <i>aunt nelled</i> the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report, <i>cackle</i> they, and we will report it.

    <li>But the <i>Duchess</i> is with me as a <i>dowry butch</i> <i>nanna</i> <i>una</i>: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not prosper: their everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten.
    </li>
    <li>But, O <i>Duchess</i> of hosts, that triest the <i>bona</i>, and <i>vardest</i> the reins and the <i>thumping cheat</i>, let me <i>varda</i> thy <i>the rights</i> on them: for unto thee have I opened my cause.

    <li><i>Varda</i>, the days <i>troll</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, that I will raise unto <i>Davina</i> a <i>bona</i> Branch, and a <i>dowriest homie</i> shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.
    </li>
    <li>In <i>her</i> days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall <i>lett</i> safely: and this is <i>her</i> name whereby <i>she</i> shall be <i>screeched</i>, THE <i>Duchess</i> OUR <i>bonaness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore, <i>varda</i>, the days <i>troll</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, that they shall <i>nishta</i> <i>cackle</i>, The <i>Duchess</i> <i>letteth</i>, which brought up the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel out of the land of Egypt;
    </li>
    <li>But, The <i>Duchess</i> <i>letteth</i>, which brought up and which led the <i>maria</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of Israel out of the north country, and from all countries whither I had driven them; and they shall <i>lett</i> in their own land.
    </li>
    <li>Mine <i>thumping cheat</i> within me is broken because of the prophets; all my bones shake; I am like a <i>daffy</i> <i>homie</i>, and like a <i>homie</i> whom <i>sherry</i> hath overcome, because of the <i>Duchess</i>, and because of the <i>lavs</i> of <i>her</i> holiness.
    </li>
    <li>For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the <i>dolly</i> places of the <i>nishta smoke</i> are dried up, and their course is <i>nana</i>, and their force is not <i>sweet</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For both prophet and <i>godly homie</i> are <i>billingsgate</i>; <i>any road up</i>, in my <i>lattie</i> have I found their <i>naffness</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the <i>munge</i>: they shall be driven on, and fall therein: for I will <i>parker</i> <i>nana</i> upon them, even the year of their visitation, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And I have <i>vardad</i> folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied in Baal, and caused my <i>homies and palones</i> Israel to err.
    </li>
    <li>I have <i>vardad</i> also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible <i>fakement</i>: they commit adultery, and <i>mince</i> in lies: they strengthen also the <i>fambles</i> of evildoers, that none doth return from <i>her</i> <i>naffness</i>; they are all of them unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts concerning the prophets; <i>varda</i>, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them <i>buvare</i> the <i>aqua</i> of gall: for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness <i>trolled</i> forth into all the land.
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts, <i>aunt nell</i> not unto the <i>lavs</i> of the prophets that prophesy unto you: they make you vain: they <i>cackle</i> a vision of their own <i>thumping cheat</i>, and not out of the <i>screech</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>They <i>cackle</i> still unto them that despise me, The <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>cackled</i>, Ye shall have peace; and they <i>cackle</i> unto every <i>una</i> that <i>minceth</i> after the imagination of <i>her</i> own <i>thumping cheat</i>, No <i>nana</i> shall <i>troll</i> upon you.
    </li>
    <li>For who hath stood in the counsel of the <i>Duchess</i>, and hath perceived and <i>aunt nelled</i> <i>her</i> <i>lav</i>? who hath marked <i>her</i> <i>lav</i>, and <i>aunt nelled</i> it?
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, a whirlwind of the <i>Duchess</i> is <i>trolled</i> forth in fury, even a <i>naff</i> whirlwind: it shall fall grievously upon the <i>eke</i> of the <i>naff</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>wild</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> shall not return, until <i>she</i> have executed, and till <i>she</i> have performed the thoughts of <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>: in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly.
    </li>
    <li>I have not <i>laued</i> these prophets, yet they ran: I have not <i>cackled</i> to them, yet they prophesied.
    </li>
    <li>But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my <i>homies and palones</i> to <i>aunt nell</i> my <i>lavs</i>, then they should have turned them from their <i>nana</i> way, and from the <i>nana</i> of their doings.
    </li>
    <li>Am I a <i>Gloria</i> at <i>famble</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, and not a <i>Gloria</i> <i>nishta ajax</i> off?
    </li>
    <li>Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not <i>varda</i> <i>her</i>? <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>. <i>Nix</i> I fill heaven and earth? <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I have <i>aunt nelled</i> what the prophets <i>cackled</i>, that prophesy lies in my name, <i>cackling</i>, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.
    </li>
    <li>How long shall this be in the <i>thumping cheat</i> of the prophets that prophesy lies? <i>any road up</i>, they are prophets of the deceit of their own <i>thumping cheat</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Which think to cause my <i>homies and palones</i> to forget my name by their dreams which they <i>cackle</i> every <i>homie</i> to <i>her</i> <i>homie ajax</i>, as their <i>aunties</i> have forgotten my name for Baal.
    </li>
    <li>The prophet that hath a dream, let <i>her</i> <i>cackle</i> a dream; and <i>she</i> that hath my <i>lav</i>, let <i>her</i> <i>cackle</i> my <i>lav</i> <i>fabulously</i>. What is the chaff to the wheat? <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Is not my <i>lav</i> like as a <i>binco fakement</i>? <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?
    </li>
    <li>Therefore, <i>varda</i>, I am against the prophets, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, that <i>sharper</i> my <i>lavs</i> every <i>una</i> from <i>her</i> <i>homie ajax</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, I am against the prophets, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, that use their <i>polaris</i>, and <i>cackle</i>, <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, and do <i>cackle</i> them, and cause my <i>homies and palones</i> to err by their lies, and by their lightness; yet I <i>laued</i> them not, <i>nishta</i> commanded them: therefore they shall not profit this <i>homies and palones</i> at all, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when this <i>homies and palones</i>, or the prophet, or a <i>godly homie</i>, shall ask thee, <i>cackling</i>, What is the burden of the <i>Duchess</i>? thou shalt then <i>cackle</i> unto them, What burden? I will even forsake you, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And as for the prophet, and the <i>godly homie</i>, and the <i>homies and palones</i>, that shall <i>cackle</i>, The burden of the <i>Duchess</i>, I will even <i>zsa zsa</i> that <i>homie</i> and <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thus shall ye <i>cackle</i> every <i>una</i> to <i>her</i> <i>homie ajax</i>, and every <i>una</i> to <i>her</i> <i>sister</i>, What hath the <i>Duchess</i> answered? and, What hath the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And the burden of the <i>Duchess</i> shall ye mention <i>nishta</i>: for every <i>homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lav</i> shall be <i>her</i> burden; for ye have perverted the <i>lavs</i> of the living <i>Gloria</i>, of the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts our <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thus shalt thou <i>cackle</i> to the prophet, What hath the <i>Duchess</i> answered thee? and, What hath the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i>?
    </li>
    <li>But since ye <i>cackle</i>, The burden of the <i>Duchess</i>; therefore thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>; Because ye <i>cackle</i> this <i>lav</i>, The burden of the <i>Duchess</i>, and I have <i>laued</i> unto you, <i>cackling</i>, <i>nanti</i> <i>cackle</i>, The burden of the <i>Duchess</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Therefore, <i>varda</i>, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the <i>smoke</i> that I <i>parkered</i> you and your <i>aunties</i>, and cast you out of my presence:
    </li>
    <li>And I will <i>parker</i> an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual <i>scharda</i>, which shall not be forgotten.

    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> shewed me, and, <i>varda</i>, <i>dewey</i> baskets of figs were set before the <i>holy carsey</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, after that Nebuchadrezzar <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon had <i>lelled</i> away captive Jeconiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jehoiakim <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, and the <i>princesses</i> of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.
    </li>
    <li><i>Una</i> basket had <i>dowry</i> <i>bona</i> figs, even like the figs that are first ripe: and the other basket had <i>dowry</i> naughty figs, which could not be <i>jarried</i>, they were so <i>cod</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> the <i>Duchess</i> unto me, What <i>vardest</i> thou, Jeremiah? And I <i>cackled</i>, Figs; the <i>bona</i> figs, <i>dowry</i> <i>bona</i>; and the <i>nana</i>, <i>dowry</i> <i>nana</i>, that cannot be <i>jarried</i>, they are so <i>nana</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Again the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> unto me, <i>cackling</i>,

    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, the <i>Gloria</i> of Israel; Like these <i>bona</i> figs, so will I acknowledge them that are <i>lelled</i> away captive of Judah, whom I have <i>laued</i> out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their <i>bona</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For I will set mine <i>ogles</i> upon them for <i>bona</i>, and I will <i>parker</i> them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.
    </li>
    <li>And I will <i>parker</i> them an <i>thumping cheat</i> to know me, that I am the <i>Duchess</i>: and they shall be my <i>homies and palones</i>, and I will be their <i>Gloria</i>: for they shall return unto me with their whole <i>thumping cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And as the <i>nana</i> figs, which cannot be <i>jarried</i>, they are so <i>nana</i>; surely thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, So will I <i>parker</i> Zedekiah the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, and <i>her</i> <i>princesses</i>, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that <i>lett</i> in the land of Egypt:

    <li>And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt, to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them.

    <li>And I will <i>lau</i> the <i>dowry efink</i>, the <i>nix munjarlee</i>, and the <i>bad style</i>, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I <i>parkered</i> unto them and to their <i>aunties</i>.

    <li>Moreover I will <i>lell</i> from them the <i>cackling fakement</i> of mirth, and the <i>cackling fakement</i> of gladness, the <i>cackling fakement</i> of the bridegroom, and the <i>cackling fakement</i> of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the <i>sparkle</i> of the candle.

    <li>For many nations and <i>dowry</i> <i>dowriest homies</i> shall serve themselves of them also: and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the works of their own <i>fambles</i>.

    <li>Then the prophet Jeremiah <i>cackled</i> unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the <i>godly homies</i>, and in the presence of all the <i>homies and palones</i> that stood in the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>,

    <li><i>Varda</i>, the whirlwind of the <i>Duchess</i> goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the <i>eke</i> of the <i>naff</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The fierce <i>wild</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> shall not return, until <i>she</i> hath done it, and until <i>she</i> have performed the intents of <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>: in the latter days ye shall consider it.

    <h2>Chapter 31</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>At the same time, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, will I be the <i>Gloria</i> of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, The <i>homies and palones</i> which were <i>dry</i> of the <i>dowry efink</i> found <i>gracie</i> in the <i>nishta smoke</i>; even Israel, when I <i>trolled</i> to cause <i>her</i> to <i>lettie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> hath appeared of <i>badge</i> unto me, <i>cackling</i>, <i>any road up</i>, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.
    </li>
    <li>Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O <i>nanti charver</i> of Israel: thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt <i>troll forth</i> in the dances of them that make merry.
    </li>
    <li>Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the planters shall plant, and shall <i>jarry</i> them as common <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For there shall be a <i>journo</i>, that the watchmen upon the mount Ephraim shall <i>screech</i>, Arise ye, and let us <i>troll</i> up to Zion unto the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>; Sing with gladness for Jacob, and <i>screech</i> among the <i>dowriest</i> of the nations: publish ye, praise ye, and <i>cackle</i>, O <i>Duchess</i>, save thy <i>homies and palones</i>, the remnant of Israel.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, I will <i>parker</i> them from the north country, and gather them from the coasts of the earth, and with them the <i>nanti varda</i> and the <i>nanti wallop</i>, the <i>palone</i> <i>up the duff</i> and her that travaileth <i>up the duff</i> together: a <i>dowry</i> company shall return thither.
    </li>
    <li>They shall <i>troll</i> with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to <i>mince</i> by the rivers of <i>aquas</i> in a <i>hettie</i> way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a <i>Auntie</i> to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.
    </li>
    <li><i>Aunt nell</i> the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, O ye nations, and <i>screech</i> it in the isles <i>nishta ajax</i> off, and <i>cackle</i>, <i>she</i> that scattered Israel will gather <i>her</i>, and keep <i>her</i>, as a shepherd doth <i>her</i> flock.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>Duchess</i> hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed <i>her</i> from the <i>famble</i> of <i>her</i> that was <i>butcher</i> than <i>she</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore they shall <i>troll</i> and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of the <i>Duchess</i>, for wheat, and for <i>sherry</i>, and for <i>lube</i>, and for the <i>bean</i> of the flock and of the herd: and their <i>nishta lucoddy</i> shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not <i>sharda</i> any more at all.
    </li>
    <li>Then shall the <i>nanti charver</i> rejoice in the <i>wallop</i>, both <i>bean coves</i> and <i>badge</i> together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their <i>sharda</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And I will satiate the <i>nishta lucoddy</i> of the <i>godly homies</i> with fatness, and my <i>homies and palones</i> shall be satisfied with my goodness, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>; A <i>cackling fakement</i> was <i>aunt nelled</i> in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her <i>chavvies</i> refused to be comforted for her <i>chavvies</i>, because they were not.
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>; Refrain thy <i>cackling fakement</i> from weeping, and thine <i>ogles</i> from tears: for thy <i>acting dickey</i> shall be rewarded, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>; and they shall <i>troll</i> again from the land of the enemy.
    </li>
    <li>And there is hope in thine end, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, that thy <i>chavvies</i> shall <i>troll</i> again to their own border.
    </li>
    <li>I have surely <i>aunt nelled</i> Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art the <i>Duchess</i> my <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I <i>slapped</i> upon my thigh: I was ashamed, <i>any road up</i>, even <i>bamboozled</i>, because I did bear the reproach of my <i>beandom</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Is Ephraim my dear <i>homie chavvie</i>? is <i>she</i> a <i>dolly</i> <i>chavvie</i>? for since I <i>cackled</i> against <i>her</i>, I do earnestly remember <i>her</i> still: therefore my <i>chutney locker</i> are troubled for <i>her</i>; I will surely have mercy upon <i>her</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Set thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps: set thine <i>thumping cheat</i> toward the highway, even the way which thou wentest: turn again, O <i>nanti charver</i> of Israel, turn again to these thy <i>smokes</i>.
    </li>
    <li>How long wilt thou <i>troll about</i>, O thou backsliding <i>palone chavvie</i>? for the <i>Duchess</i> hath created a new <i>fakement</i> in the earth, A <i>palone</i> shall compass a <i>homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts, the <i>Gloria</i> of Israel; As yet they shall use this <i>cackle</i> in the land of Judah and in the <i>smokes</i> thereof, when I shall <i>parker</i> again their captivity; The <i>Duchess</i> bless thee, O habitation of justice, and mountain of holiness.
    </li>
    <li>And there shall <i>lett</i> in Judah itself, and in all the <i>smokes</i> thereof together, husbandmen, and they that <i>troll forth</i> with flocks.
    </li>
    <li>For I have satiated the <i>a stretcher case</i> <i>nishta lucoddy</i>, and I have replenished every <i>shardaful</i> <i>nishta lucoddy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my <i>letty</i> was <i>bona</i> unto me.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, the days <i>troll</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, that I will sow the <i>lattie</i> of Israel and the <i>lattie</i> of Judah with the <i>maria</i> of <i>homie</i>, and with the <i>maria</i> of beast.
    </li>
    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, that like as I have watched over them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to <i>battyfang</i>, and to afflict; so will I <i>varda</i> over them, to build, and to plant, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>In those days they shall <i>cackle</i> <i>nishta</i>, The <i>aunties</i> have <i>jarried</i> a sour grape, and the <i>chavvies</i>&#8216;s <i>hampsteads</i> are set on edge.
    </li>
    <li>But every <i>una</i> shall <i>cark it</i> for <i>her</i> own <i>codness</i>: every <i>homie</i> that eateth the sour grape, <i>her</i> <i>hampsteads</i> shall be set on edge.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, the days <i>troll</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, that I will make a new covenant with the <i>lattie</i> of Israel, and with the <i>lattie</i> of Judah:
    </li>
    <li>Not according to the covenant that I made with their <i>aunties</i> in the <i>journo</i> that I <i>lelled</i> them by the <i>famble</i> to <i>parker</i> them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an <i>homie affair</i> unto them, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>:
    </li>
    <li>But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the <i>lattie</i> of Israel; After those days, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, I will put my law in their inward parts, and <i>screeve</i> it in their <i>thumping cheats</i>; and will be their <i>Gloria</i>, and they shall be my <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they shall teach <i>nishta</i> every <i>homie</i> <i>her</i> <i>homie ajax</i>, and every <i>homie</i> <i>her</i> <i>sister</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Know the <i>Duchess</i>: for they shall all know me, from the <i>nanti dowriest</i> of them unto the <i>dowriest</i> of them, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>: for I will forgive their <i>codness</i>, and I will remember their <i>kertever</i> <i>nishta</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, which giveth the sun for a <i>sparkle</i> by <i>journo</i>, and the ordinances of the moon and of the <i>twinkling fakements</i> for a <i>sparkle</i> by <i>nochy</i>, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof <i>butch shriek</i>; The <i>Duchess</i> of hosts is <i>her</i> name:
    </li>
    <li>If those ordinances <i>troll off</i> from before me, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, then the <i>maria</i> of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the <i>maria</i> of Israel for all that they have done, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, the days <i>troll</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, that the <i>smoke</i> shall be built to the <i>Duchess</i> from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the corner.
    </li>
    <li>And the measuring line shall yet <i>troll forth</i> over against it upon the hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath.
    </li>
    <li>And the whole valley of the <i>stiff</i> bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east, shall be <i>fabulosa</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>; it shall not be plucked up, <i>nishta</i> thrown down any more for ever.

    <h2>Chapter 32</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>The <i>lav</i> that <i>trolled</i> to Jeremiah from the <i>Duchess</i> in the <i>dachath</i> year of Zedekiah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.
    </li>
    <li>For then the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon&#8217;s army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the <i>charpering carsey</i>, which was in the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah&#8217;s <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For Zedekiah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah had shut <i>her</i> up, <i>cackling</i>, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and <i>cackle</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>varda</i>, I will <i>parker</i> this <i>smoke</i> into the <i>famble</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon, and <i>she</i> shall <i>lell</i> it;
    </li>
    <li>And Zedekiah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah shall not escape out of the <i>famble</i> of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be <i>laued</i> into the <i>famble</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon, and shall <i>cackle</i> with <i>her</i> <i>screech</i> to <i>screech</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i> shall <i>varda</i> <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall <i>she</i> be until I visit <i>her</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>: though ye <i>palaver</i> with the Chaldeans, <i>nanti</i> prosper.
    </li>
    <li>And Jeremiah <i>cackled</i>, The <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> unto me, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, Hanameel the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Shallum thine uncle shall <i>troll</i> unto thee <i>cackling</i>, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth: for the <i>sweet</i> of redemption is thine to buy it.
    </li>
    <li>So Hanameel mine uncle&#8217;s <i>homie chavvie</i> <i>trolled</i> to me in the court of the <i>charpering carsey</i> according to the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin: for the <i>sweet</i> of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for thyself. Then I knew that this was the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle&#8217;s <i>homie chavvie</i>, that was in Anathoth, and weighed <i>her</i> the <i>dinarly</i>, even seventeen <i>medzers</i> of silver.
    </li>
    <li>And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and <i>lelled</i> witnesses, and weighed <i>her</i> the <i>dinarly</i> in the balances.
    </li>
    <li>So I <i>lelled</i> the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed according to the law and custom, and that which was open:
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>parkered</i> the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Neriah, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Maaseiah, in the <i>vardaing</i> of Hanameel mine uncle&#8217;s <i>homie chavvie</i>, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the <i>glossy</i> of the purchase, before all the <i>kosher homies</i> that sat in the court of the <i>charpering carsey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And I charged Baruch before them, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts, the <i>Gloria</i> of Israel; <i>lell</i> these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen <i>fakement</i>, that they may continue many days.
    </li>
    <li>For thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts, the <i>Gloria</i> of Israel; <i>latties</i> and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.
    </li>
    <li>Now when I had <i>laued</i> the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Neriah, I prayed unto the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Ah <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>! <i>varda</i>, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy <i>dowry</i> power and stretched out arm, and there is <i>nishter</i> too hard for thee:
    </li>
    <li>Thou shewest lovingkindness unto <i>milles</i>, and <i>parkerest</i> the <i>codness</i> of the <i>aunties</i> into the bosom of their <i>chavvies</i> after them: the <i>dowry</i>, the <i>dowry butch</i> <i>Gloria</i>, the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts, is <i>her</i> name,
    </li>
    <li><i>Dowry</i> in counsel, and <i>dowry butch</i> in <i>acting dickey</i>: for thine <i>ogles</i> are open upon all the ways of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of <i>homies</i>: to <i>parker</i> every <i>una</i> according to <i>her</i> ways, and according to the fruit of <i>her</i> doings:
    </li>
    <li>Which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto this <i>journo</i>, and in Israel, and among other <i>homies</i>; and hast made thee a name, as at this <i>journo</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And hast brought forth thy <i>homies and palones</i> Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a <i>butch</i> <i>famble</i>, and with a stretched out arm, and with <i>dowry</i> terror;
    </li>
    <li>And hast <i>parkered</i> them this land, which thou didst swear to their <i>aunties</i> to <i>parker</i> them, a land flowing with <i>gin and tonic</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>trolled</i> in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy <i>cackling fakement</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>minced</i> in thy law; they have done <i>nishter</i> of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this <i>nana</i> to <i>troll</i> upon them:
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i> the mounts, they are <i>troll</i> unto the <i>smoke</i> to <i>lell</i> it; and the <i>smoke</i> is <i>parkered</i> into the <i>famble</i> of the Chaldeans, that <i>palaver</i> against it, because of the <i>dowry efink</i>, and of the <i>nix munjarlee</i>, and of the <i>bad style</i>: and what thou hast <i>cackled</i> is <i>troll</i> to pass; and, <i>varda</i>, thou <i>vardest</i> it.
    </li>
    <li>And thou hast <i>cackled</i> unto me, O <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>, Buy thee the field for <i>dinarly</i>, and <i>lell</i> witnesses; for the <i>smoke</i> is <i>parkered</i> into the <i>famble</i> of the Chaldeans.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>trolled</i> the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> unto Jeremiah, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, I am the <i>Duchess</i>, the <i>Gloria</i> of all flesh: is there any <i>fakement</i> too hard for me?
    </li>
    <li>Therefore thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>; <i>varda</i>, I will <i>parker</i> this <i>smoke</i> into the <i>famble</i> of the Chaldeans, and into the <i>famble</i> of Nebuchadrezzar <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon, and <i>she</i> shall <i>lell</i> it:
    </li>
    <li>And the Chaldeans, that <i>palaver</i> against this <i>smoke</i>, shall <i>troll</i> and set <i>binco fakement</i> on this <i>smoke</i>, and burn it with the <i>latties</i>, upon whose roofs they have offered <i>smelly</i> unto Baal, and poured out <i>buvare</i> <i>parkerings</i> unto other gods, to provoke me to <i>wild</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel and the <i>chavvies</i> of Judah have only done <i>nana</i> before me from their <i>beandom</i>: for the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel have only provoked me to <i>wild</i> with the <i>acting dickey</i> of their <i>fambles</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For this <i>smoke</i> hath been to me as a provocation of mine <i>wild</i> and of my fury from the <i>journo</i> that they built it even unto this <i>journo</i>; that I should remove it from before my <i>eke</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Because of all the <i>nana</i> of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel and of the <i>chavvies</i> of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to <i>wild</i>, they, their <i>dowriest homies</i>, their <i>princesses</i>, their <i>godly homies</i>, and their prophets, and the <i>homies</i> of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And they have turned unto me the back, and not the <i>eke</i>: though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not <i>aunt nelled</i> to <i>lall</i> instruction.
    </li>
    <li>But they set their <i>dowry cods</i> in the <i>lattie</i>, which is <i>screeched</i> by my name, to defile it.
    </li>
    <li>And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Hinnom, to cause their <i>homie chavvies</i> and their <i>palone chavvies</i> to pass through the <i>binco fakement</i> unto Molech; which I commanded them not, <i>nishta</i> <i>trolled</i> it into my mind, that they should do this <i>dowry cod</i>, to cause Judah to <i>kertever</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And now therefore thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, the <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, concerning this <i>smoke</i>, whereof ye <i>cackle</i>, It shall be <i>laued</i> into the <i>famble</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon by the <i>dowry efink</i>, and by the <i>nix munjarlee</i>, and by the <i>bad style</i>;
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have driven them in mine <i>wild</i>, and in my fury, and in <i>dowry</i> wrath; and I will <i>parker</i> them again unto this place, and I will cause them to <i>lett</i> safely:
    </li>
    <li>And they shall be my <i>homies and palones</i>, and I will be their <i>Gloria</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And I will <i>parker</i> them <i>una</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>, and <i>una</i> way, that they may fear me for ever, for the <i>bona</i> of them, and of their <i>chavvies</i> after them:
    </li>
    <li>And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them <i>bona</i>; but I will put my fear in their <i>thumping cheats</i>, that they shall not <i>sling yer hook</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, I will rejoice over them to do them <i>bona</i>, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole <i>thumping cheat</i> and with my whole <i>nishta lucoddy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>; Like as I have brought all this <i>dowry</i> <i>nana</i> upon this <i>homies and palones</i>, so will I <i>parker</i> upon them all the <i>bona</i> that I have promised them.
    </li>
    <li>And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye <i>cackle</i>, It is desolate <i>nanti</i> <i>homie</i> or beast; it is <i>parkered</i> into the <i>famble</i> of the Chaldeans.
    </li>
    <li><i>Homies</i> shall buy fields for <i>dinarly</i>, and subscribe evidences, and seal them, and <i>lell</i> witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the <i>smokes</i> of Judah, and in the <i>smokes</i> of the mountains, and in the <i>smokes</i> of the valley, and in the <i>smokes</i> of the south: for I will cause their captivity to return, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.

    <h2>Chapter 33</h2>

    <li>Moreover the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> unto Jeremiah the second time, while <i>she</i> was yet shut up in the court of the <i>charpering carsey</i>, <i>cackling</i>,

    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> the maker thereof, the <i>Duchess</i> that formed it, to establish it; the <i>Duchess</i> is <i>her</i> name;

    <li><i>Screech</i> unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee <i>dowry</i> and <i>dowry butch</i> <i>fakements</i>, which thou knowest not.

    </li>
    <li>They <i>troll</i> to <i>palaver</i> with the Chaldeans, but it is to fill them with the <i>stiff</i> bodies of <i>homies</i>, whom I have <i>ferricadoozed</i> in mine <i>wild</i> and in my fury, and for all whose <i>naffness</i> I have hid my <i>eke</i> from this <i>smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, I will <i>parker</i> it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.
    </li>
    <li>And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.
    </li>
    <li>And I will cleanse them from all their <i>codness</i>, whereby they have <i>kertervered</i> against me; and I will pardon all their <i>cods</i>, whereby they have <i>kertervered</i>, and whereby they have transgressed against me.

    <li>And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth, which shall <i>aunt nell</i> all the <i>bona</i> that I do unto them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure unto it.
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>; Again there shall be <i>aunt nelled</i> in this place, which ye <i>cackle</i> shall be desolate <i>nanti</i> <i>homie</i> and <i>nanti</i> beast, even in the <i>smokes</i> of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, <i>nanti</i> <i>homie</i>, and <i>nanti</i> inhabitant, and <i>nanti</i> beast,

    <li>In the <i>smokes</i> of the mountains, in the <i>smokes</i> of the vale, and in the <i>smokes</i> of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the <i>smokes</i> of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the <i>fambles</i> of <i>her</i> that telleth them, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.

    <li>Then may also my covenant be broken with <i>Davina</i> my <i>serving homie</i>, that <i>she</i> should not have a <i>homie chavvie</i> to reign upon <i>her</i> throne; and with the Levites the <i>godly homies</i>, my ministers.

    <li>As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, <i>nishta</i> the sand of the sea measured: so will I multiply the <i>maria</i> of <i>Davina</i> my <i>serving homie</i>, and the Levites that minister unto me.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> to Jeremiah, <i>cackling</i>,

    <li>Considerest thou not what this <i>homies and palones</i> have <i>cackled</i>, <i>cackling</i>, The <i>dewey</i> families which the <i>Duchess</i> hath chosen, <i>she</i> hath even cast them off? thus they have despised my <i>homies and palones</i>, that they should be <i>nishta</i> a nation before them.

    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>; If my covenant be not with <i>journo</i> and <i>nochy</i>, and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;

    <li>Then will I cast away the <i>maria</i> of Jacob and <i>Davina</i> my <i>serving homie</i>, so that I will not <i>lell</i> any of <i>her</i> <i>maria</i> to be rulers over the <i>maria</i> of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and have mercy on them.

    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, the <i>Gloria</i> of Israel; <i>troll</i> and <i>cackle</i> to Zedekiah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, and <i>cackle</i> <i>her</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>; <i>varda</i>, I will <i>parker</i> this <i>smoke</i> into the <i>famble</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon, and <i>she</i> shall burn it with <i>binco fakement</i>:

    <li>Yet <i>aunt nell</i> the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, O Zedekiah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah; Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of thee, <i>nishta</i> <i>cark it</i> by the <i>dowry efink</i>:

    <li>But thou shalt <i>cark it</i> in peace: and with the burnings of thy <i>aunties</i>, the former <i>dowriest homies</i> which were before thee, so shall they burn odours for thee; and they will lament thee, <i>cackling</i>, Ah <i>Duchess</i>! for I have pronounced the <i>lav</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then Jeremiah the prophet <i>cackled</i> all these <i>lavs</i> unto Zedekiah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah in Jerusalem,

    <li>When the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon&#8217;s army <i>palavered</i> against Jerusalem, and against all the <i>smokes</i> of Judah that were <i>dry</i>, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defenced <i>smokes</i> remained of the <i>smokes</i> of Judah.

    <li>This is the <i>lav</i> that <i>trolled</i> unto Jeremiah from the <i>Duchess</i>, after that the <i>dowriest homie</i> Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the <i>homies and palones</i> which were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them;

    <li>That every <i>homie</i> should let <i>her</i> <i>homieservant</i>, and every <i>homie</i> <i>her</i> <i>palone servant</i>, being an <i>Kosher Homie</i> or an Hebrewess, <i>troll</i> free; that none should serve himself of them, to wit, of a <i>kosher homie</i> <i>her</i> <i>sister</i>.

    <li>Now when all the <i>princesses</i>, and all the <i>homies and palones</i>, which had entered into the covenant, <i>aunt nelled</i> that every <i>una</i> should let <i>her</i> <i>homieservant</i>, and every <i>una</i> <i>her</i> <i>palone servant</i>, <i>troll</i> free, that none should serve themselves of them any more, then they obeyed, and let them <i>troll</i>.

    <li>But afterward they turned, and caused the <i>serving homies</i> and the <i>famble palones</i>, whom they had let <i>troll</i> free, to return, and brought them into subjection for <i>serving homies</i> and for <i>famble palones</i>.

    <li>Therefore the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> to Jeremiah from the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>cackling</i>,

    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, the <i>Gloria</i> of Israel; I made a covenant with your <i>aunties</i> in the <i>journo</i> that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the <i>lattie</i> of bondmen, <i>cackling</i>,

    <li>At the end of <i>setter</i> years let ye <i>troll</i> every <i>homie</i> <i>her</i> <i>sister</i> an <i>Kosher Homie</i>, which hath been sold unto thee; and when <i>she</i> hath served thee <i>sey</i> years, thou shalt let <i>her</i> <i>troll</i> free from thee: but your <i>aunties</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> not unto me, <i>nishta</i> inclined their <i>aunt nelling cheat</i>.

    <li>And ye were now turned, and had done <i>sweet</i> in my <i>vardaing</i>, in proclaiming liberty every <i>homie</i> to <i>her</i> <i>homie ajax</i>; and ye had made a covenant before me in the <i>lattie</i> which is <i>screeched</i> by my name:

    <li>Therefore thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>; Ye have not <i>aunt nelled</i> unto me, in proclaiming liberty, every <i>una</i> to <i>her</i> <i>sister</i>, and every <i>homie</i> to <i>her</i> <i>homie ajax</i>: <i>varda</i>, I proclaim a liberty for you, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, to the <i>dowry efink</i>, to the <i>bad style</i>, and to the <i>nix munjarlee</i>; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.
    </li>
    <li>And I will <i>parker</i> the <i>homies</i> that have transgressed my covenant, which have not performed the <i>lavs</i> of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in twain, and passed between the parts thereof,

    <li>And Zedekiah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah and <i>her</i> <i>princesses</i> will I <i>parker</i> into the <i>famble</i> of their enemies, and into the <i>famble</i> of them that <i>charper</i> their life, and into the <i>famble</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon&#8217;s army, which are <i>trolled</i> up from you.

    <li><i>Varda</i>, I will command, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, and cause them to <i>troll back to</i> this <i>smoke</i>; and they shall <i>palaver</i> against it, and <i>lell</i> it, and burn it with <i>binco fakement</i>: and I will make the <i>smokes</i> of Judah a desolation <i>nanti</i> an inhabitant.

    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, the <i>Gloria</i> of Israel; Thus shall ye <i>cackle</i> to the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, that <i>laued</i> you unto me to enquire of me; <i>varda</i>, Pharaoh&#8217;s army, which is <i>troll</i> forth to help you, shall <i>troll back to</i> Egypt into their own land.
    </li>
    <li>And the Chaldeans shall <i>troll</i> again, and <i>palaver</i> against this <i>smoke</i>, and <i>lell</i> it, and burn it with <i>binco fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>; <i>mogue</i> not yourselves, <i>cackling</i>, The Chaldeans shall surely <i>troll off</i> from us: for they shall not <i>troll off</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that <i>palaver</i> against you, and there remained but wounded <i>homies</i> among them, yet should they rise up every <i>homie</i> in <i>her</i> <i>trolling lettie</i>, and burn this <i>smoke</i> with <i>binco fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh&#8217;s army,
    </li>
    <li>Then Jeremiah <i>trolled</i> forth out of Jerusalem to <i>troll</i> into the land of Benjamin, to separate himself thence in the midst of the <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Shelemiah, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Hananiah; and <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> Jeremiah the prophet, <i>cackling</i>, Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> Jeremiah, It is false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans. But <i>she</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> not to <i>her</i>: so Irijah <i>lelled</i> Jeremiah, and brought <i>her</i> to the <i>princesses</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore the <i>princesses</i> were <i>dander</i> with Jeremiah, and <i>slapped</i> <i>her</i>, and put <i>her</i> in <i>charpering carsey</i> in the <i>lattie</i> of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the <i>charpering carsey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;
    </li>
    <li>Then Zedekiah the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>laued</i>, and <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> out: and the <i>dowriest homie</i> asked <i>her</i> secretly in <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Is there any <i>lav</i> from the <i>Duchess</i>? And Jeremiah <i>cackled</i>, There is: for, <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i>, thou shalt be <i>laued</i> into the <i>famble</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover Jeremiah <i>cackled</i> unto <i>dowriest homie</i> Zedekiah, What have I offended against thee, or against thy <i>serving homies</i>, or against this <i>homies and palones</i>, that ye have put me in <i>charpering carsey</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you, <i>cackling</i>, The <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon shall not <i>troll</i> against you, <i>nishta</i> against this land?
    </li>
    <li>Therefore <i>aunt nell</i> now, I pray thee, O my <i>Duchess</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>: let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to <i>troll back to</i> the <i>lattie</i> of Jonathan the scribe, lest I <i>cark it</i> there.
    </li>
    <li>Then Zedekiah the <i>dowriest homie</i> commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the <i>charpering carsey</i>, and that they should <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> daily a piece of <i>pannan</i> out of the bakers&#8217; street, until all the <i>pannan</i> in the <i>smoke</i> were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the <i>charpering carsey</i>.
    </li>

    <h2>Chapter 38</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Then Shephatiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Mattan, and Gedaliah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Pashur, and Jucal the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Shelemiah, and Pashur the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Malchiah, <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>lavs</i> that Jeremiah had <i>cackled</i> unto all the <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>she</i> that remaineth in this <i>smoke</i> shall <i>cark it</i> by the <i>dowry efink</i>, by the <i>nix munjarlee</i>, and by the <i>bad style</i>: but <i>she</i> that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for <i>she</i> shall have <i>her</i> life for a prey, and shall live.
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, This <i>smoke</i> shall surely be <i>parkered</i> into the <i>famble</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon&#8217;s army, which shall <i>lell</i> it.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore the <i>princesses</i> <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>, We beseech thee, let this <i>homie</i> be put to <i>carking it</i>: for thus <i>she</i> weakeneth the <i>fambles</i> of the <i>homies</i> of <i>barney</i> that remain in this <i>smoke</i>, and the <i>fambles</i> of all the <i>homies and palones</i>, in speaking such <i>lavs</i> unto them: for this <i>homie</i> <i>charpereth</i> not the welfare of this <i>homies and palones</i>, but the hurt.
    </li>
    <li>Then Zedekiah the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, <i>she</i> is in your <i>famble</i>: for the <i>dowriest homie</i> is not <i>she</i> that can do any <i>fakement</i> against you.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>lelled</i> they Jeremiah, and cast <i>her</i> into the dungeon of Malchiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Hammelech, that was in the court of the <i>charpering carsey</i>: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no <i>aqua</i>, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.
    </li>
    <li>Now when Ebedmelech the <i>schvartza</i>, <i>una</i> of the eunuchs which was in the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, <i>aunt nelled</i> that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the <i>dowriest homie</i> then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;
    </li>
    <li>Ebedmelech <i>trolled</i> forth out of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, and <i>cackled</i> to the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>My <i>Duchess</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>, these <i>homies</i> have done <i>nana</i> in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and <i>she</i> is like to <i>cark it</i> for hunger in the place where <i>she</i> is: for there is <i>nishta</i> <i>pannan</i> in the <i>smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>dowriest homie</i> commanded Ebedmelech the <i>schvartza</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>lell</i> from hence <i>trey dacha</i> <i>homies</i> with thee, and <i>lell</i> up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before <i>she</i> <i>cark it</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So Ebedmelech <i>lelled</i> the <i>homies</i> with <i>her</i>, and <i>trolled</i> into the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> under the treasury, and <i>lelled</i> thence <i>badge</i> cast clouts and <i>badge</i> rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.
    </li>
    <li>And Ebedmelech the <i>schvartza</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Jeremiah, Put now these <i>badge</i> cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.
    </li>
    <li>So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the <i>charpering carsey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then Zedekiah the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>laued</i>, and <i>lelled</i> Jeremiah the prophet unto <i>her</i> into the third entry that is in the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>: and the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a <i>fakement</i>; hide <i>nishter</i> from me.
    </li>
    <li>Then Jeremiah <i>cackled</i> unto Zedekiah, If I <i>screech</i> it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to <i>carking it</i>? and if I <i>parker</i> thee counsel, wilt thou not <i>aunt nell</i> unto me?
    </li>
    <li>So Zedekiah the <i>dowriest homie</i> sware secretly unto Jeremiah, <i>cackling</i>, As the <i>Duchess</i> <i>letteth</i>, that made us this <i>nishta lucoddy</i>, I will not put thee to <i>carking it</i>, <i>nishta</i> will I <i>parker</i> thee into the <i>famble</i> of these <i>homies</i> that <i>charper</i> thy life.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, the <i>Gloria</i> of hosts, the <i>Gloria</i> of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly <i>troll forth</i> unto the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon&#8217;s <i>princesses</i>, then thy <i>nishta lucoddy</i> shall live, and this <i>smoke</i> shall not be burned with <i>binco fakement</i>; and thou shalt live, and thine <i>lattie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>But if thou wilt not <i>troll forth</i> to the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon&#8217;s <i>princesses</i>, then shall this <i>smoke</i> be <i>parkered</i> into the <i>famble</i> of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with <i>binco fakement</i>, and <i>nishta</i> escape out of their <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Zedekiah the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the <i>kosher homies</i> that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their <i>famble</i>, and they mock me.
    </li>
    <li>But Jeremiah <i>cackled</i>, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, the <i>cackling fakement</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, which I <i>cackle</i> unto thee: so it shall be well unto thee, and thy <i>nishta lucoddy</i> shall live.
    </li>
    <li>But if thou refuse to <i>troll forth</i>, this is the <i>lav</i> that the <i>Duchess</i> hath shewed me:
    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, all the <i>palones</i> that are <i>dry</i> in the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah&#8217;s <i>lattie</i> shall be brought forth to the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon&#8217;s <i>princesses</i>, and those <i>palones</i> shall <i>cackle</i>, Thy <i>bencoves</i> have set thee on, and have prevailed against thee: thy <i>plates</i> are sunk in the mire, and they are turned away back.
    </li>
    <li>So they shall <i>parker</i> out all thy <i>palone affairs</i> and thy <i>chavvies</i> to the Chaldeans: and <i>nishta</i> escape out of their <i>famble</i>, but shalt be <i>lelled</i> by the <i>famble</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this <i>smoke</i> to be burned with <i>binco fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no <i>homie</i> know of these <i>lavs</i>, and <i>nishta</i> <i>cark it</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But if the <i>princesses</i> <i>aunt nell</i> that I have talked with thee, and they <i>troll</i> unto thee, and <i>cackle</i> unto thee, <i>screech</i> unto us now what thou hast <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to <i>carking it</i>; also what the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto thee:
    </li>
    <li>Then thou shalt <i>cackle</i> unto them, I presented my supplication before the <i>dowriest homie</i>, that <i>she</i> would not cause me to <i>troll back to</i> Jonathan&#8217;s <i>lattie</i>, to <i>cark it</i> there.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>trolled</i> all the <i>princesses</i> unto Jeremiah, and asked <i>her</i>: and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> them according to all these <i>lavs</i> that the <i>dowriest homie</i> had commanded. So they <i>dry</i> off speaking with <i>her</i>; for the matter was not perceived.
    </li>
    <li>So Jeremiah <i>letted</i> in the court of the <i>charpering carsey</i> until the <i>journo</i> that Jerusalem was <i>lelled</i>: and <i>she</i> was there when Jerusalem was <i>lelled</i>.

    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 39</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>In the ninth year of Zedekiah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, in the <i>dachath</i> month, <i>trolled</i> Nebuchadrezzar <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon and all <i>her</i> army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.
    </li>
    <li>And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the <i>quarter</i> month, the ninth <i>journo</i> of the month, the <i>smoke</i> was broken up.
    </li>
    <li>And all the <i>princesses</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon <i>trolled</i> in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the <i>princesses</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, that when Zedekiah the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah <i>vardad</i> them, and all the <i>homies</i> of <i>barney</i>, then they fled, and <i>trolled</i> forth out of the <i>smoke</i> by <i>nochy</i>, by the way of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s garden, by the gate betwixt the <i>dewey</i> walls: and <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> out the way of the plain.
    </li>
    <li>But the Chaldeans&#8217; army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i>, they brought <i>her</i> up to Nebuchadnezzar <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> judgment upon <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon <i>ferricadoozaed</i> the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Zedekiah in Riblah before <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i>: also the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon <i>ferricadoozaed</i> all the nobles of Judah.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover <i>she</i> put out Zedekiah&#8217;s <i>ogles</i>, and bound <i>her</i> with chains, to carry <i>her</i> to Babylon.
    </li>
    <li>And the Chaldeans burned the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, and the <i>latties</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i>, with <i>binco fakement</i>, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the <i>charpering homie</i> <i>lelled</i> away captive into Babylon the remnant of the <i>homies and palones</i> that remained in the <i>smoke</i>, and those that fell away, that fell to <i>her</i>, with the <i>lettie</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i> that remained.
    </li>
    <li>But Nebuzaradan the captain of the <i>charpering homie</i> <i>dry</i> of the <i>nanti dinarly</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i>, which had <i>nishter</i>, in the land of Judah, and <i>parkered</i> them vineyards and fields at the same time.
    </li>
    <li>Now Nebuchadrezzar <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon <i>parkered</i> charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the <i>charpering homie</i>, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Lell</i> <i>her</i>, and <i>varda</i> well to <i>her</i>, and do <i>her</i> no harm; but do unto <i>her</i> even as <i>she</i> shall <i>cackle</i> unto thee.
    </li>
    <li>So Nebuzaradan the captain of the <i>charpering homie</i> <i>laued</i>, and Nebushasban, Rabsaris, and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon&#8217;s <i>princesses</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Even they <i>laued</i>, and <i>lelled</i> Jeremiah out of the court of the <i>charpering carsey</i>, and committed <i>her</i> unto Gedaliah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ahikam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Shaphan, that <i>she</i> should carry <i>her</i> home: so <i>she</i> <i>letted</i> among the <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> unto Jeremiah, while <i>she</i> was shut up in the court of the <i>charpering carsey</i>, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Troll</i> and <i>cackle</i> to Ebedmelech the <i>schvartza</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts, the <i>Gloria</i> of Israel; <i>varda</i>, I will <i>parker</i> my <i>lavs</i> upon this <i>smoke</i> for <i>nana</i>, and not for <i>bona</i>; and they shall be accomplished in that <i>journo</i> before thee.
    </li>
    <li>But I will deliver thee in that <i>journo</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>: and <i>nishta</i> be <i>parkered</i> into the <i>famble</i> of the <i>homies</i> of whom thou art afraid.
    </li>
    <li>For I will surely deliver thee, and <i>nishta</i> fall by the <i>dowry efink</i>, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee: because thou hast put thy trust in me, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.

    <h2>Chapter 40</h2>

    <li>The <i>lav</i> that <i>trolled</i> to Jeremiah from the <i>Duchess</i>, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the <i>charpering homie</i> had let <i>her</i> <i>troll</i> from Ramah, when <i>she</i> had <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> being bound in chains among all that were <i>lelled</i> away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were <i>lelled</i> away captive unto Babylon.
    </li>
    <li>And the captain of the <i>charpering homie</i> <i>lelled</i> Jeremiah, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, The <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> hath pronounced this <i>nana</i> upon this place.
    </li>
    <li>Now the <i>Duchess</i> hath brought it, and done according as <i>she</i> hath <i>cackled</i>: because ye have <i>kertervered</i> against the <i>Duchess</i>, and have not obeyed <i>her</i> <i>cackling fakement</i>, therefore this <i>fakement</i> is <i>troll</i> upon you.
    </li>
    <li>And now, <i>varda</i>, I loose thee this <i>journo</i> from the chains which were upon thine <i>famble</i>. If it seem <i>bona</i> unto thee to <i>troll</i> with me into Babylon, <i>troll</i>; and I will <i>varda</i> well unto thee: but if it seem ill unto thee to <i>troll</i> with me into Babylon, forbear: <i>varda</i>, all the land is before thee: whither it seemeth <i>bona</i> and convenient for thee to <i>troll</i>, thither <i>troll</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now while <i>she</i> was not yet <i>trolled</i> back, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>troll</i> back also to Gedaliah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ahikam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Shaphan, whom the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon hath made governor over the <i>smokes</i> of Judah, and <i>lett</i> with <i>her</i> among the <i>homies and palones</i>: or <i>troll</i> wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to <i>troll</i>. So the captain of the <i>charpering homie</i> <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> victuals and a <i>parkering</i>, and let <i>her</i> <i>troll</i>.

    <li>Then <i>trolled</i> Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ahikam to Mizpah; and <i>letted</i> with <i>her</i> among the <i>homies and palones</i> that were <i>dry</i> in the land.

    <li>Then they <i>trolled</i> to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Kareah, and Seraiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Tanhumeth, and the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of a Maachathite, they and their <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Gedaliah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ahikam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Shaphan sware unto them and to their <i>homies</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: <i>lett</i> in the land, and serve the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.

    <li>As for me, <i>varda</i>, I will <i>lett</i> at Mizpah, to serve the Chaldeans, which will <i>troll</i> unto us: but ye, gather ye <i>sherry</i>, and summer fruits, and <i>lube</i>, and put them in your <i>fakements</i>, and <i>lett</i> in your <i>smokes</i> that ye have <i>lelled</i>.

    <li>Likewise when all the <i>kosher homies</i> that were in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, <i>aunt nelled</i> that the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon had <i>dry</i> a remnant of Judah, and that <i>she</i> had set over them Gedaliah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ahikam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Shaphan;

    <li>Even all the <i>kosher homies</i> <i>trolled back</i> out of all places whither they were driven, and <i>trolled</i> to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered <i>sherry</i> and summer fruits <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry</i>.

    <li>Then Johanan the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Kareah <i>cackled</i> to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly <i>cackling</i>, Let me <i>troll</i>, I pray thee, and I will <i>ferricadooza</i> Ishmael the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nethaniah, and no <i>homie</i> shall know it: wherefore should <i>she</i> <i>ferricadooza</i> thee, that all the <i>kosher homies</i> which are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant in Judah perish?
    </li>
    <li>But Gedaliah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ahikam <i>cackled</i> unto Johanan the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Kareah, <i>nishta</i> do this <i>fakement</i>: for thou <i>cacklest</i> falsely of Ishmael.

    <h2>Chapter 41</h2>

    <li>Then arose Ishmael the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nethaniah, and the <i>dacha</i> <i>homies</i> that were with <i>her</i>, and <i>slapped</i> Gedaliah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ahikam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Shaphan with the <i>dowry efink</i>, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> <i>her</i>, whom the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon had made governor over the land.
    </li>
    <li>Ishmael also <i>ferricadoozaed</i> all the <i>kosher homies</i> that were with <i>her</i>, even with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the <i>homies</i> of <i>barney</i>.

    <li><i>Any road up</i> the second <i>journo</i> after <i>she</i> had <i>ferricadoozed</i> Gedaliah, and no <i>homie</i> knew it,

    <li>That there <i>trolled</i> certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore <i>homies</i>, having their beards shaven, and their <i>zhoosh</i> rent, and having cut themselves, with <i>parkerings</i> and <i>smelly</i> in their <i>famble</i>, to <i>parker</i> them to the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.

    <li>And Ishmael the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nethaniah <i>trolled</i> forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i>: <i>any road up</i>, as <i>she</i> met them, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>troll</i> to Gedaliah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ahikam.

    <li>And it was so, when they <i>trolled</i> into the midst of the <i>smoke</i>, that Ishmael the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nethaniah <i>ferricadoozaed</i> them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, <i>she</i>, and the <i>homies</i> that were with <i>her</i>.

    <li>But <i>dacha</i> <i>homies</i> were found among them that <i>cackled</i> unto Ishmael, <i>ferricadooza</i> us not: for we have <i>gelt</i> in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of <i>lube</i>, and of honey.

    </li>
    <li>In those days, and in that time, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel shall <i>troll</i>, they and the <i>chavvies</i> of Judah together, going and weeping: they shall <i>troll</i>, and <i>charper</i> the <i>Duchess</i> their <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>They shall ask the way to Zion with their <i>ekes</i> thitherward, <i>cackling</i>, <i>troll</i>, and let us join ourselves to the <i>Duchess</i> in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten.
    </li>
    <li>My <i>homies and palones</i> hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to <i>troll</i> astray, they have turned them away on the mountains: they have <i>trolled</i> from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their restingplace.
    </li>
    <li>All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries <i>cackled</i>, We offend not, because they have <i>kertervered</i> against the <i>Duchess</i>, the habitation of justice, even the <i>Duchess</i>, the hope of their <i>aunties</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and <i>troll forth</i> out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the <i>she</i> goats before the flocks.
    </li>
    <li>For, lo, I will raise and cause to <i>troll</i> up against Babylon an assembly of <i>dowry</i> nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be <i>lelled</i>: their arrows shall be as of a <i>dowry butch</i> expert <i>homie</i>; none shall return in vain.
    </li>
    <li>And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow as bulls;
    </li>
    <li>Your mother shall be sore <i>bamboozled</i>; she that bare you shall be ashamed: <i>varda</i>, the hindermost of the nations shall be a <i>nishta smoke</i>, a dry land, and a desert.
    </li>
    <li>Because of the wrath of the <i>Duchess</i> it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every <i>una</i> that goeth by Babylon shall be <i>gobsmacked</i>, and hiss at all her plagues.
    </li>
    <li>Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath <i>kertervered</i> against the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Screech</i> against her round about: she hath <i>parkered</i> her <i>famble</i>: her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it is the <i>the rights</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>: <i>lell</i> <i>the rights</i> upon her; as she hath done, do unto her.
    </li>
    <li>Cut off the sower from Babylon, and <i>her</i> that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing <i>dowry efink</i> they shall turn every <i>una</i> to <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, and they shall <i>scarper</i> every <i>una</i> to <i>her</i> own land.
    </li>
    <li>Israel is a scattered sheep; the lions have driven <i>her</i> away: first the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria hath devoured <i>her</i>; and last this Nebuchadrezzar <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon hath broken <i>her</i> bones.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts, the <i>Gloria</i> of Israel; <i>varda</i>, I will <i>zsa zsa</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon and <i>her</i> land, as I have <i>zsa zsa-ed</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria.
    </li>
    <li>And I will <i>parker</i> Israel again to <i>her</i> habitation, and <i>she</i> shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and <i>her</i> <i>nishta lucoddy</i> shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and Gilead.
    </li>
    <li>In those days, and in that time, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, the <i>codness</i> of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the <i>kertervers</i> of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve.
    </li>
    <li><i>Troll</i> up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly <i>battyfang</i> after them, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, and do according to all that I have commanded thee.

    <li>A sound of battle is in the land, and of <i>dowry</i> destruction.
    </li>
    <li>How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!
    </li>
    <li>I have <i>laued</i> a snare for thee, and thou art also <i>lelled</i>, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> hath opened <i>her</i> armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of <i>her</i> indignation: for this is the <i>acting dickey</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.
    </li>
    <li><i>Troll</i> against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and <i>battyfang</i> her utterly: let <i>nishter</i> of her be <i>dry</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Ferricadooza</i> all her bullocks; let them <i>troll</i> down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their <i>journo</i> is <i>troll</i>, the time of their visitation.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>cackling fakement</i> of them that <i>scarper</i> and escape out of the land of Babylon, to <i>screech</i> in Zion the <i>the rights</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i>, the <i>the rights</i> of <i>her</i> <i>holy carsey</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Screech</i> together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend the bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her <i>acting dickey</i>; according to all that she hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against the <i>Duchess</i>, against the <i>fabulosa</i> <i>una</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore shall her <i>bean coves</i> fall in the streets, and all her <i>homies</i> of <i>barney</i> shall be cut off in that <i>journo</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, I am against thee, O thou most proud, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of hosts: for thy <i>journo</i> is <i>troll</i>, the time that I will visit thee.
    </li>
    <li>And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise <i>her</i> up: and I will kindle a <i>binco fakement</i> in <i>her</i> <i>smokes</i>, and it shall devour all round about <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts; The <i>chavvies</i> of Israel and the <i>chavvies</i> of Judah were oppressed together: and all that <i>lelled</i> them captives held them <i>nishta manjarry</i>; they refused to let them <i>troll</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Their Redeemer is <i>butch</i>; the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts is <i>her</i> name: <i>she</i> shall throughly plead their cause, that <i>she</i> may <i>parker</i> <i>lettie</i> to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.
    </li>
    <li>A <i>dowry efink</i> is upon the Chaldeans, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her <i>princesses</i>, and upon her wise <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>A <i>dowry efink</i> is upon the liars; and they shall dote: a <i>dowry efink</i> is upon her <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i>; and they shall be dismayed.
    </li>
    <li>A <i>dowry efink</i> is upon their horses, and upon their <i>rattling coves</i>, and upon all the mingled <i>homies and palones</i> that are in the midst of her; and they shall become as <i>palones</i>: a <i>dowry efink</i> is upon her <i>gelt</i>; and they shall be robbed.
    </li>
    <li>A <i>nishta parnie</i> is upon her <i>aquas</i>; and they shall be dried up: for it is the land of graven images, and they are mad upon their idols.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall <i>lett</i> there, and the owls shall <i>lett</i> therein: and it shall be <i>nishta</i> inhabited for ever; <i>nishta</i> shall it be <i>letted</i> in from generation to generation.
    </li>
    <li>As <i>Gloria</i> overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the <i>homie ajax</i> <i>smokes</i> thereof, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>; so shall no <i>homie</i> <i>lett</i> there, <i>nishta</i> shall any <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> <i>lett</i> therein.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, a <i>homies and palones</i> shall <i>troll</i> from the north, and a <i>dowry</i> nation, and many <i>dowriest homies</i> shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.
    </li>
    <li>They shall hold the bow and the lance: they are cruel, and will not shew mercy: their <i>cackling fakement</i> shall <i>butch shriek</i> like the sea, and they shall ride upon horses, every <i>una</i> put in array, like a <i>homie</i> to the battle, against thee, O <i>palone chavvie</i> of Babylon.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon hath <i>aunt nelled</i> the report of them, and <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i> waxed feeble: anguish <i>lelled</i> hold of <i>her</i>, and pangs as of a <i>palone</i> in travail.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, <i>she</i> shall <i>troll</i> up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan unto the habitation of the <i>butch</i>: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who is a chosen <i>homie</i>, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?
    </li>
    <li>Therefore <i>aunt nell</i> ye the counsel of the <i>Duchess</i>, that <i>she</i> hath <i>lelled</i> against Babylon; and <i>her</i> purposes, that <i>she</i> hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the <i>nanti dowriest</i> of the flock shall draw them out: surely <i>she</i> shall make their habitation desolate with them.
    </li>
    <li>At the <i>screech</i> of the taking of Babylon the earth is <i>trolled</i>, and the <i>screech</i> is <i>aunt nelled</i> among the nations.

    <h2>Chapter 51</h2>

    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>; <i>varda</i>, I will raise up against Babylon, and against them that <i>lett</i> in the midst of them that rise up against me, a destroying wind;
    </li>
    <li>And will <i>lau</i> unto Babylon fanners, that shall fan her, and shall empty her land: for in the <i>journo</i> of trouble they shall be against her round about.
    </li>
    <li>Against <i>her</i> that bendeth let the archer bend <i>her</i> bow, and against <i>her</i> that lifteth himself up in <i>her</i> brigandine: and spare ye not her <i>bean coves</i>; <i>battyfang</i> ye utterly all her host.
    </li>
    <li>Thus the <i>ferricadoozed</i> shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and they that are thrust through in her streets.
    </li>
    <li>For Israel hath not been forsaken, <i>nishta</i> Judah of <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i>, of the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts; though their land was filled with <i>kertever</i> against the <i>fabulosa</i> <i>una</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li><i>Scarper</i> out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every <i>homie</i> <i>her</i> <i>nishta lucoddy</i>: be not cut off in her <i>codness</i>; for this is the time of the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s <i>the rights</i>; <i>she</i> will render unto her a recompence.
    </li>
    <li>Babylon hath been a golden cup in the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s <i>famble</i>, that made all the earth <i>daffy</i>: the nations have <i>daffy</i> of her <i>sherry</i>; therefore the nations are mad.
    </li>
    <li>Babylon is suddenly fallen and <i>battyfanged</i>: howl for her; <i>lell</i> balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.
    </li>
    <li>We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us <i>troll</i> every <i>una</i> into <i>her</i> own country: for her judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> hath brought forth our <i>bonaness</i>: <i>troll</i>, and let us <i>screech</i> in Zion the <i>acting dickey</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the <i>Duchess</i> hath raised up the <i>Fairy</i> of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of the Medes: for <i>her</i> device is against Babylon, to <i>battyfang</i> it; because it is the <i>the rights</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, the <i>the rights</i> of <i>her</i> <i>holy carsey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon, make the <i>varda</i> <i>butch</i>, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the <i>Duchess</i> hath both devised and done that which <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> against the inhabitants of Babylon.
    </li>
    <li>O thou that dwellest upon many <i>aquas</i>, abundant in <i>gelt</i>, thine end is <i>troll</i>, and the measure of thy <i>ogling</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> of hosts hath sworn by himself, <i>cackling</i>, Surely I will fill thee with <i>homies</i>, as with caterpillers; and they shall lift up a <i>screech</i> against thee.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> hath made the earth by <i>her</i> power, <i>she</i> hath established the world by <i>her</i> wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by <i>her</i> understanding.
    </li>
    <li>When <i>she</i> uttereth <i>her</i> <i>cackling fakement</i>, there is a multitude of <i>aquas</i> in the heavens; and <i>she</i> causeth the vapours to <i>troll up</i> from the ends of the earth: <i>she</i> maketh lightnings with rain, and <i>parkereth</i> forth the wind out of <i>her</i> <i>gelt</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Every <i>homie</i> is brutish by <i>her</i> knowledge; every founder is <i>bamboozled</i> by the graven image: for <i>her</i> molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.
    </li>
    <li>They are <i>spangly</i>, the <i>acting dickey</i> of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
    </li>
    <li>The portion of Jacob is not like them; for <i>she</i> is the former of all <i>fakements</i>: and Israel is the rod of <i>her</i> inheritance: the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts is <i>her</i> name.
    </li>
    <li>Thou art my battle axe and weapons of <i>barney</i>: for with thee will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I <i>battyfang</i> kingdoms;

    <li>And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and <i>her</i> rider; and with thee will I break in pieces the <i>trundling cheat</i> and <i>her</i> rider;

    <li>I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and <i>her</i> flock; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and <i>her</i> yoke of oxen; and with thee will I break in pieces captains and rulers.
    </li>
    <li>And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their <i>nana</i> that they have done in Zion in your <i>vardaing</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.

    <li><i>Varda</i>, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, which destroyest all the earth: and I will stretch out mine <i>famble</i> upon thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain.
    </li>
    <li>And they shall not <i>lell</i> of thee a stone for a corner, <i>nishta</i> a stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the <i>tooting fakement</i> among the nations, prepare the nations against her, <i>screech</i> together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to <i>troll</i> up as the rough caterpillers.
    </li>
    <li>Prepare against her the nations with the <i>dowriest homies</i> of the Medes, the captains thereof, and all the rulers thereof, and all the land of <i>her</i> dominion.
    </li>
    <li>And the land shall tremble and <i>sharda</i>: for every purpose of the <i>Duchess</i> shall be performed against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a desolation <i>nanti</i> an inhabitant.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i> of Babylon have forborn to <i>palaver</i>, they have remained in their holds: their might hath failed; they became as <i>palones</i>: they have burned her dwellingplaces; her bars are broken.
    </li>
    <li><i>Una</i> post shall run to meet another, and <i>una</i> messenger to meet another, to shew the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon that <i>her</i> <i>smoke</i> is <i>lelled</i> at <i>una</i> end,
    </li>
    <li>And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have burned with <i>binco fakement</i>, and the <i>homies</i> of <i>barney</i> are affrighted.
    </li>
    <li>For thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts, the <i>Gloria</i> of Israel; The <i>palone chavvie</i> of Babylon is like a threshingfloor, it is time to thresh her: yet a <i>bijou</i> while, and the time of her harvest shall <i>troll</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Nebuchadrezzar the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon hath devoured me, <i>she</i> hath crushed me, <i>she</i> hath made me an empty <i>fakement</i>, <i>she</i> hath <i>jarried</i> me up like a <i>drag queen</i>, <i>she</i> hath filled <i>her</i> belly with my delicates, <i>she</i> hath cast me out.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>slapping</i> done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall the inhabitant of Zion <i>cackle</i>; and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem <i>cackle</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>; <i>varda</i>, I will plead thy cause, and <i>lell</i> <i>the rights</i> for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make her springs dry.
    </li>
    <li>And Babylon shall become heaps, a <i>lattie</i> for <i>drag queens</i>, an <i>gobsmacked-ness</i>, and an hissing, <i>nanti</i> an inhabitant.
    </li>
    <li>They shall <i>butch shriek</i> together like lions: they shall yell as lions&#8217; whelps.
    </li>
    <li>In their heat I will make their <i>dowry munjarlees</i>, and I will make them <i>daffy</i>, that they may rejoice, and <i>letty</i> a perpetual <i>letty</i>, and not wake, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.

    <li>I will <i>parker</i> them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with <i>she</i> goats.
    </li>
    <li>How is Sheshach <i>lelled</i>! and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised! how is Babylon become an <i>gobsmacked-ness</i> among the nations!
    </li>
    <li>The sea is <i>troll</i> up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.

    <li>Her <i>smokes</i> are a desolation, a dry land, and a <i>nishta smoke</i>, a land wherein no <i>homie</i> <i>letteth</i>, <i>nishta</i> doth any <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> pass thereby.
    </li>
    <li>And I will <i>zsa zsa</i> Bel in Babylon, and I will <i>parker</i> forth out of <i>her</i> <i>screech</i> that which <i>she</i> hath <i>jarried</i> up: and the nations shall not flow together any more unto <i>her</i>: <i>any road up</i>, the wall of Babylon shall fall.
    </li>
    <li>My <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>troll</i> ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every <i>homie</i> <i>her</i> <i>nishta lucoddy</i> from the fierce <i>wild</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.

    <li>And lest your <i>thumping cheat</i> faint, and ye fear for the <i>gossip</i> that shall be <i>aunt nelled</i> in the land; a <i>gossip</i> shall both <i>troll</i> <i>una</i> year, and after that in another year shall <i>troll</i> a <i>gossip</i>, and <i>slapping</i> in the land, ruler against ruler.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore, <i>varda</i>, the days <i>troll</i>, that I will do judgment upon the graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be <i>bamboozled</i>, and all her <i>ferricadoozed</i> shall fall in the midst of her.
    </li>
    <li>Then the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for Babylon: for the spoilers shall <i>troll</i> unto her from the north, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>As Babylon hath caused the <i>ferricadoozed</i> of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the <i>ferricadoozed</i> of all the earth.
    </li>
    <li>Ye that have <i>scarpered</i> the <i>dowry efink</i>, <i>troll away</i>, stand not still: remember the <i>Duchess</i> <i>nishta ajax</i> off, and let Jerusalem <i>troll</i> into your mind.

    <li>We are <i>bamboozled</i>, because we have <i>aunt nelled</i> reproach: <i>scharda</i> hath covered our <i>ekes</i>: for strangers are <i>troll</i> into the sanctuaries of the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore, <i>varda</i>, the days <i>troll</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, that I will do judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land the wounded shall groan.
    </li>
    <li>Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her <i>butchness</i>, yet from me shall spoilers <i>troll</i> unto her, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>A sound of a <i>screech</i> <i>trolleth</i> from Babylon, and <i>dowry</i> destruction from the land of the Chaldeans:
    </li>
    <li>Because the <i>Duchess</i> hath spoiled Babylon, and <i>battyfanged</i> out of her the <i>dowry</i> <i>cackling fakement</i>; when her waves do <i>butch shriek</i> like <i>dowry</i> <i>aquas</i>, a <i>screech</i> of their <i>cackling fakement</i> is uttered:
    </li>
    <li>Because the spoiler is <i>troll</i> upon her, even upon Babylon, and her <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i> are <i>lelled</i>, every <i>una</i> of their bows is broken: for the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of recompences shall surely requite.
    </li>
    <li>And I will make <i>bevvied</i> her <i>princesses</i>, and her wise <i>homies</i>, her captains, and her rulers, and her <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i>: and they shall <i>letty</i> a perpetual <i>letty</i>, and not wake, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>, whose name is the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts.
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with <i>binco fakement</i>; and the <i>homies and palones</i> shall <i>acting dickey</i> in vain, and the folk in the <i>binco fakement</i>, and they shall be <i>a stretcher case</i>.

    <li>So Jeremiah <i>screeved</i> in a <i>glossy</i> all the <i>nana</i> that should <i>troll</i> upon Babylon, even all these <i>lavs</i> that are <i>screeved</i> against Babylon.
    </li>
    <li>And Jeremiah <i>cackled</i> to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and shalt <i>varda</i>, and shalt <i>varda the lavs</i> all these <i>lavs</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Then shalt thou <i>cackle</i>, O <i>Duchess</i>, thou hast <i>cackled</i> against this place, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, <i>nishta</i> <i>homie</i> <i>nishta</i> beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever.
    </li>
    <li>And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of <i>vardaing the lavs</i> this <i>glossy</i>, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates:
    </li>
    <li>And thou shalt <i>cackle</i>, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the <i>nana</i> that I will <i>parker</i> upon her: and they shall be <i>a stretcher case</i>. Thus far are the <i>lavs</i> of Jeremiah.

    <li>Zedekiah was <i>una</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i> years <i>badge</i> when <i>she</i> began to reign, and <i>she</i> reigned <i>long dedger</i> years in Jerusalem. And <i>her</i> mother&#8217;s name was Hamutal the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Jeremiah of Libnah.

    <li>And <i>she</i> did that which was <i>nana</i> in the <i>ogles</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.

    <li>For through the <i>wild</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> it <i>trolled</i> to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, till <i>she</i> had cast them out from <i>her</i> presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon.

    <li>Then the <i>smoke</i> was broken up, and all the <i>homies</i> of <i>barney</i> fled, and <i>trolled</i> forth out of the <i>smoke</i> by <i>nochy</i> by the way of the gate between the <i>dewey</i> walls, which was by the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s garden; (now the Chaldeans were by the <i>smoke</i> round about:) and they <i>trolled</i> by the way of the plain.
    </li>
    <li>But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all <i>her</i> army was scattered from <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then they <i>lelled</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> up unto the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> judgment upon <i>her</i>.
