    <h1>Nehemiah</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>The <i>lavs</i> of Nehemiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Hachaliah. <i>Any road up</i> in the month Chisleu, in the <i>dewey dachath</i> year, as I was in Shushan the <i>dowry lattie</i>,
    </li>
    <li>That Hanani, <i>una</i> of my <i>sisters</i>, <i>trolled</i>, <i>she</i> and certain <i>homies</i> of Judah; and I asked them concerning the <i>kosher homies</i> that had <i>scarpered</i>, which were <i>dry</i> of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>cackled</i> unto me, The remnant that are <i>dry</i> of the captivity there in the province are in <i>dowry</i> affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with <i>binco fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when I <i>aunt nelled</i> these <i>lavs</i>, that I sat down and <i>parnied</i>, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the <i>Gloria</i> of heaven,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackled</i>, I beseech thee, O <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of heaven, the <i>dowry</i> and <i>nanna</i> <i>Gloria</i>, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love <i>her</i> and observe <i>her</i> <i>butch lavs</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Let thine <i>aunt nelling cheat</i> now be attentive, and thine <i>ogles</i> open, that thou mayest <i>aunt nell</i> the <i>meshigener muttering</i> of thy <i>serving homie</i>, which I pray before thee now, <i>journo</i> and <i>nochy</i>, for the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel thy <i>serving homies</i>, and <i>dish</i> the <i>kertervers</i> of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, which we have <i>kertervered</i> against thee: both I and my <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i> have <i>kertervered</i>.
    </li>
    <li>We have dealt <i>dowry</i> corruptly against thee, and have not kept the <i>butch lavs</i>, <i>nishta</i> the <i>dowry lavs</i>, <i>nishta</i> the judgments, which thou commandedst thy <i>serving homie</i> <i>Maureen</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Remember, I beseech thee, the <i>lav</i> that thou commandedst thy <i>serving homie</i> <i>Maureen</i>, <i>cackling</i>, If ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:
    </li>
    <li>But if ye turn unto me, and keep my <i>butch lavs</i>, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will <i>parker</i> them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.
    </li>
    <li>Now these are thy <i>serving homies</i> and thy <i>homies and palones</i>, whom thou hast redeemed by thy <i>dowry</i> power, and by thy <i>butch</i> <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>O <i>Duchess</i>, I beseech thee, let now thine <i>aunt nelling cheat</i> be attentive to the <i>meshigener muttering</i> of thy <i>serving homie</i>, and to the <i>meshigener muttering</i> of thy <i>serving homies</i>, who <i>fancy</i> to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy <i>serving homie</i> this <i>journo</i>, and grant <i>her</i> mercy in the <i>vardaing</i> of this <i>homie</i>. For I was the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s cupbearer.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> in the month Nisan, in the <i>dewey dachath</i> year of Artaxerxes the <i>dowriest homie</i>, that <i>sherry</i> was before <i>her</i>: and I <i>lelled</i> up the <i>sherry</i>, and <i>parkered</i> it unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>. Now I had not been beforetime sad in <i>her</i> presence.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, <i>vardaing</i> thou art not sick? this is <i>nishter</i> else but <i>sharda</i> of <i>thumping cheat</i>. Then I was <i>dowry</i> sore afraid,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>, Let the <i>dowriest homie</i> live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the <i>smoke</i>, the place of my <i>aunties</i>&#8216; sepulchres, <i>lettieth</i> waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with <i>binco fakement</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the <i>Gloria</i> of heaven.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>, If it please the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and if thy <i>serving homie</i> have found favour in thy <i>vardaing</i>, that thou wouldest <i>lau</i> me unto Judah, unto the <i>smoke</i> of my <i>aunties</i>&#8216; sepulchres, that I may build it.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, (the <i>dowriest palone</i> also sitting by <i>her</i>,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the <i>dowriest homie</i> to <i>lau</i> me; and I set <i>her</i> a time.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover I <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>, If it please the <i>dowriest homie</i>, let letters be <i>parkered</i> me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I <i>troll</i> into Judah;
    </li>
    <li>And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s forest, that <i>she</i> may <i>parker</i> me timber to make beams for the gates of the <i>dowry lattie</i> which appertained to the <i>lattie</i>, and for the wall of the <i>smoke</i>, and for the <i>lattie</i> that I shall enter into. And the <i>dowriest homie</i> granted me, according to the <i>bona</i> <i>famble</i> of my <i>Gloria</i> upon me.
    </li>
    <li>Then I <i>trolled</i> to the governors beyond the river, and <i>parkered</i> them the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s letters. Now the <i>dowriest homie</i> had <i>laued</i> captains of the army and horsemen with me.
    </li>
    <li>When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the <i>serving homie</i>, the Ammonite, <i>aunt nelled</i> of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there was <i>troll</i> a <i>homie</i> to <i>charper</i> the welfare of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>So I <i>trolled</i> to Jerusalem, and was there <i>trey</i> days.
    </li>
    <li>And I arose in the <i>nochy</i>, I and some <i>nishta dowry</i> <i>homies</i> with me; <i>nishta</i> <i>cackled</i> I any <i>homie</i> what my <i>Gloria</i> had put in my <i>thumping cheat</i> to do at Jerusalem: <i>nishta</i> was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>trolled</i> out by <i>nochy</i> by the gate of the valley, even before the <i>drag queen</i> well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with <i>binco fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then I <i>trolled</i> on to the gate of the fountain, and to the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>trolled</i> I up in the <i>nochy</i> by the brook, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so <i>trolled back</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the rulers knew not whither I <i>trolled</i>, or what I did; <i>nishta</i> had I as yet <i>cackled</i> it to the <i>kosher homies</i>, <i>nishta</i> to the <i>godly homies</i>, <i>nishta</i> to the nobles, <i>nishta</i> to the rulers, <i>nishta</i> to the <i>lettie</i> that did the <i>acting dickey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> I unto them, Ye <i>varda</i> the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem <i>lettieth</i> waste, and the gates thereof are burned with <i>binco fakement</i>: <i>troll</i>, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be <i>nishta</i> a reproach.
    </li>
    <li>Then I <i>cackled</i> them of the <i>famble</i> of my <i>Gloria</i> which was <i>bona</i> upon me; as also the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lavs</i> that <i>she</i> had <i>cackled</i> unto me. And they <i>cackled</i>, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their <i>fambles</i> for this <i>bona</i> <i>acting dickey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the <i>serving homie</i>, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, <i>aunt nelled</i> it, they <i>tittered</i> us to scorn, and despised us, and <i>cackled</i>, What is this <i>fakement</i> that ye do? will ye rebel against the <i>dowriest homie</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Then answered I them, and <i>cackled</i> unto them, The <i>Gloria</i> of heaven, <i>she</i> will prosper us; therefore we <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i> will arise and build: but ye have no portion, <i>nishta</i> <i>sweet</i>, <i>nishta</i> memorial, in Jerusalem.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Then Eliashib the high <i>godly homie</i> rose up with <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i> the <i>godly homies</i>, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Meah they sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananeel.
    </li>
    <li>And next unto <i>her</i> builded the <i>homies</i> of Jericho. And next to them builded Zaccur the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Imri.
    </li>
    <li>But the fish gate did the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Hassenaah build, who also <i>laued</i> the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.

    <li>Moreover the <i>badge</i> gate repaired Jehoiada the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Paseah, and Meshullam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Besodeiah; they <i>laued</i> the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, and the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.
    </li>
    <li>And next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the Meronothite, the <i>homies</i> of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, unto the throne of the governor on this side the river.

    </li>
    <li>But the dung gate repaired Malchiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Rechab, the ruler of part of Bethhaccerem; <i>she</i> built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.
    </li>
    <li>But the gate of the fountain repaired Shallun the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Colhozeh, the ruler of part of Mizpah; <i>she</i> built it, and covered it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and the wall of the pool of Siloah by the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s garden, and unto the stairs that <i>troll</i> down from the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i>.

After <i>her</i> Pedaiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Parosh.

    </li>
    <li>And between the going up of the corner unto the sheep gate repaired the goldsmiths and the <i>bodega homies</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>But it <i>trolled</i> to pass, that when Sanballat <i>aunt nelled</i> that we builded the wall, <i>she</i> was <i>dander</i>, and <i>lelled</i> <i>dowry</i> indignation, and mocked the <i>kosher homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> before <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i> and the army of Samaria, and <i>cackled</i>, What do these feeble <i>kosher homies</i>? will they fortify themselves? will they <i>parker</i>? will they make an end in a <i>journo</i>? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?
    </li>
    <li>Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by <i>her</i>, and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Even that which they build, if a fox <i>troll</i> up, <i>she</i> shall even break down their stone wall.
    </li>
    <li><i>Aunt nell</i>, O our <i>Gloria</i>; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their own <i>eke</i>, and <i>parker</i> them for a prey in the land of captivity:
    </li>
    <li>And cover not their <i>codness</i>, and let not their <i>kertever</i> be blotted out from before thee: for they have provoked thee to <i>wild</i> before the builders.
    </li>
    <li>So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof: for the <i>homies and palones</i> had a mind to <i>acting dickey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But it <i>trolled</i> to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, <i>aunt nelled</i> that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were <i>dowry</i> <i>dander</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And conspired all of them together to <i>troll</i> and to <i>palaver</i> against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> we made our <i>meshigener muttering</i> unto our <i>Gloria</i>, and set a <i>varda</i> against them <i>journo</i> and <i>nochy</i>, because of them.
    </li>
    <li>And Judah <i>cackled</i>, The <i>butchness</i> of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is <i>dowry</i> rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.
    </li>
    <li>And our adversaries <i>cackled</i>, They shall not know, <i>nishta</i> <i>varda</i>, till we <i>troll</i> in the midst among them, and <i>ferricadooza</i> them, and cause the <i>acting dickey</i> to cease.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, that when the <i>kosher homies</i> which <i>letted</i> by them <i>trolled</i>, they <i>cackled</i> unto us <i>dacha</i> times, From all places whence ye shall return unto us they will be upon you.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the higher places, I even set the <i>homies and palones</i> after their families with their <i>dowry efinks</i>, their spears, and their bows.
    </li>
    <li>And I looked, and rose up, and <i>cackled</i> unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the <i>lettie</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i>, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the <i>Duchess</i>, which is <i>dowry</i> and <i>nanna</i>, and <i>palaver</i> for your <i>sisters</i>, your <i>homie chavvies</i>, and your <i>palone chavvies</i>, your <i>palone affairs</i>, and your <i>latties</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when our enemies <i>aunt nelled</i> that it was known unto us, and <i>Gloria</i> had brought their counsel to nought, that we <i>trolled back</i> all of us to the wall, every <i>una</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>acting dickey</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> from that time forth, that the half of my <i>serving homies</i> wrought in the <i>acting dickey</i>, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers were behind all the <i>lattie</i> of Judah.
    </li>
    <li>They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded, every <i>una</i> with <i>una</i> of <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i> wrought in the <i>acting dickey</i>, and with the other <i>famble</i> held a weapon.
    </li>
    <li>For the builders, every <i>una</i> had <i>her</i> <i>dowry efink</i> girded by <i>her</i> side, and so builded. And <i>she</i> that sounded the <i>tooting fakement</i> was by me.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>cackled</i> unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the <i>lettie</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i>, The <i>acting dickey</i> is <i>dowry</i> and large, and we are separated upon the wall, <i>una</i> <i>nishter ajax</i> another.
    </li>
    <li>In what place therefore ye <i>aunt nell</i> the sound of the <i>tooting fakement</i>, resort ye thither unto us: our <i>Gloria</i> shall <i>palaver</i> for us.
    </li>
    <li>So we laboured in the <i>acting dickey</i>: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the <i>twinkling fakements</i> appeared.
    </li>
    <li>Likewise at the same time <i>cackled</i> I unto the <i>homies and palones</i>, Let every <i>una</i> with <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i> lodge within Jerusalem, that in the <i>nochy</i> they may be a <i>charpering homie</i> to us, and <i>acting dickey</i> on the <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So <i>nishta</i> I, <i>nishta</i> my <i>sisters</i>, <i>nishta</i> my <i>serving homies</i>, <i>nishta</i> the <i>homies</i> of the <i>charpering homie</i> which <i>trolled after</i> me, none of us put off our <i>zhoosh</i>, saving that every <i>una</i> put them off for washing.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And there was a <i>dowry</i> <i>screech</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i> and of their <i>palone affairs</i> against their <i>sisters</i> the <i>kosher homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For there were that <i>cackled</i>, We, our <i>homie chavvies</i>, and our <i>palone chavvies</i>, are many: therefore we <i>lell</i> up corn for them, that we may <i>jarry</i>, and live.
    </li>
    <li>Some also there were that <i>cackled</i>, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and <i>latties</i>, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth.
    </li>
    <li>There were also that <i>cackled</i>, We have borrowed <i>dinarly</i> for the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards.
    </li>
    <li>Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our <i>sisters</i>, our <i>chavvies</i> as their <i>chavvies</i>: and, lo, we <i>parker</i> into bondage our <i>homie chavvies</i> and our <i>palone chavvies</i> to be <i>serving homies</i>, and some of our <i>palone chavvies</i> are brought unto bondage already: <i>nishta</i> is it in our power to redeem them; for other <i>homies</i> have our lands and vineyards.
    </li>
    <li>And I was <i>dowry</i> angry when I <i>aunt nelled</i> their <i>screech</i> and these <i>lavs</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and <i>cackled</i> unto them, Ye exact usury, every <i>una</i> of <i>her</i> <i>sister</i>. And I set a <i>dowry</i> assembly against them.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>cackled</i> unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our <i>sisters</i> the <i>kosher homies</i>, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your <i>sisters</i>? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found <i>nishter</i> to answer.
    </li>
    <li>Also I <i>cackled</i>, It is not <i>bona</i> that ye do: ought ye not to <i>mince</i> in the fear of our <i>Gloria</i> because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?
    </li>
    <li>I likewise, and my <i>sisters</i>, and my <i>serving homies</i>, might exact of them <i>dinarly</i> and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.
    </li>
    <li>Restore, I pray you, to them, even this <i>journo</i>, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their <i>latties</i>, also the hundredth part of the <i>dinarly</i>, and of the corn, the <i>sherry</i>, and the <i>lube</i>, that ye exact of them.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> they, We will restore them, and will require <i>nishter</i> of them; so will we do as thou <i>cackleth</i>. Then I <i>screeched</i> the <i>godly homies</i>, and <i>lelled</i> an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise.
    </li>
    <li>Also I shook my lap, and <i>cackled</i>, So <i>Gloria</i> shake out every <i>homie</i> from <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>, and from <i>her</i> <i>acting dickey</i>, that performeth not this promise, even thus be <i>she</i> shaken out, and emptied. And all the <i>punters</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>Larlou</i>, and praised the <i>Duchess</i>. And the <i>homies and palones</i> did according to this promise.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the <i>dewey dachath</i> year even unto the <i>dewey</i> and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the <i>dowriest homie</i>, that is, <i>kenza</i> years, I and my <i>sisters</i> have not <i>jarried</i> the <i>pannan</i> of the governor.
    </li>
    <li>But the former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the <i>homies and palones</i>, and had <i>lelled</i> of them <i>pannan</i> and <i>sherry</i>, beside <i>quarter dacha</i> <i>medzers</i> of silver; <i>any road up</i>, even their <i>serving homies</i> bare rule over the <i>homies and palones</i>: but so did not I, because of the fear of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, also I continued in the <i>acting dickey</i> of this wall, <i>nishta</i> bought we any land: and all my <i>serving homies</i> were gathered thither unto the <i>acting dickey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover there were at my table an <i>chenter</i> and <i>chinker dacha</i> of the <i>kosher homies</i> and rulers, beside those that <i>trolled</i> unto us from among the heathen that are about us.
    </li>
    <li>Now that which was prepared for me daily was <i>una</i> ox and <i>sey</i> choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in <i>dacha</i> days store of all sorts of <i>sherry</i>: yet for all this required not I the <i>pannan</i> of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Think upon me, my <i>Gloria</i>, for <i>bona</i>, according to all that I have done for this <i>homies and palones</i>.

    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now it <i>trolled</i> to pass when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the <i>lettie</i> of our enemies, <i>aunt nelled</i> that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach <i>dry</i> therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)
    </li>
    <li>That Sanballat and Geshem <i>laued</i> unto me, <i>cackling</i>, <i>troll</i>, let us meet together in some <i>una</i> of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>laued</i> messengers unto them, <i>cackling</i>, I am doing a <i>dowry</i> <i>acting dickey</i>, so that I cannot <i>troll</i> down: why should the <i>acting dickey</i> cease, whilst I leave it, and <i>troll</i> down to you?
    </li>
    <li>Yet they <i>laued</i> unto me <i>quarter</i> times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>laued</i> Sanballat <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i> unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Wherein was <i>screeved</i>, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu <i>cackleth</i> it, that thou and the <i>kosher homies</i> think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their <i>dowriest homie</i>, according to these <i>lavs</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And thou hast also appointed prophets to <i>cackle</i> of thee at Jerusalem, <i>cackling</i>, There is a <i>dowriest homie</i> in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the <i>dowriest homie</i> according to these <i>lavs</i>. <i>Troll</i> now therefore, and let us <i>lell</i> counsel together.
    </li>
    <li>Then I <i>laued</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, There are no such <i>fakements</i> done as thou <i>cackleth</i>, but thou feignest them out of thine own <i>thumping cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For they all made us afraid, <i>cackling</i>, Their <i>fambles</i> shall be weakened from the <i>acting dickey</i>, that it be not done. Now therefore, O <i>Gloria</i>, strengthen my <i>fambles</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Afterward I <i>trolled</i> unto the <i>lattie</i> of Shemaiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Delaiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Let us meet together in the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, within the <i>holy carsey</i>, and let us shut the doors of the <i>holy carsey</i>: for they will <i>troll</i> to <i>ferricadooza</i> thee; <i>any road up</i>, in the <i>nochy</i> will they <i>troll</i> to <i>ferricadooza</i> thee.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>cackled</i>, Should such a <i>homie</i> as I <i>scarper</i>? and who is there, that, being as I am, would <i>troll</i> into the <i>holy carsey</i> to save <i>her</i> life? I will not <i>troll</i> in.
    </li>
    <li>And, lo, I perceived that <i>Gloria</i> had not <i>laued</i> <i>her</i>; but that <i>she</i> pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore was <i>she</i> hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and <i>kertever</i>, and that they might have matter for an <i>nana</i> report, that they might reproach me.
    </li>
    <li>My <i>Gloria</i>, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the <i>lettie</i> of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.
    </li>
    <li>So the wall was finished in the <i>dewey dacha</i> and fifth <i>journo</i> of the month Elul, in <i>chinker dacha</i> and <i>dewey</i> days.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, that when all our enemies <i>aunt nelled</i> thereof, and all the heathen that were about us <i>vardad</i> these <i>fakements</i>, they were <i>dowry</i> cast down in their own <i>ogles</i>: for they perceived that this <i>acting dickey</i> was wrought of our <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah <i>laued</i> many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah <i>trolled</i> unto them.
    </li>
    <li>For there were many in Judah sworn unto <i>her</i>, because <i>she</i> was the <i>homie chavvie</i> in law of Shechaniah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Arah; and <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> Johanan had <i>lelled</i> the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Meshullam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Berechiah.
    </li>
    <li>Also they reported <i>her</i> <i>bona</i> deeds before me, and uttered my <i>lavs</i> to <i>her</i>. And Tobiah <i>laued</i> letters to put me in fear.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now it <i>trolled</i> to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,
    </li>
    <li>That I <i>parkered</i> my <i>sister</i> Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the <i>dowry lattie</i>, charge over Jerusalem: for <i>she</i> was a <i>fabulous</i> <i>homie</i>, and feared <i>Gloria</i> above many.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>cackled</i> unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every <i>una</i> in <i>her</i> <i>varda</i>, and every <i>una</i> to be over against <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now the <i>smoke</i> was large and <i>dowry</i>: but the <i>homies and palones</i> were <i>nishta dowry</i> therein, and the <i>latties</i> were not builded.
    </li>
    <li>And my <i>Gloria</i> put into mine <i>thumping cheat</i> to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the <i>homies and palones</i>, that they might be reckoned by genealogy.

    <li>These are the <i>chavvies</i> of the province, that <i>trolled</i> up out of the captivity, of those that had been <i>lelled</i> away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon had <i>lelled</i> away, and <i>trolled</i> again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every <i>una</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>smoke</i>;

    <li>And all the <i>homies and palones</i> gathered themselves together as <i>una</i> <i>homie</i> into the street that was before the <i>aqua</i> gate; and they <i>cackled</i> unto Ezra the scribe to <i>parker</i> the <i>glossy</i> of the law of <i>Maureen</i>, which the <i>Duchess</i> had commanded to Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And Ezra the <i>godly homie</i> brought the law before the <i>punters</i> both of <i>homies</i> and <i>palones</i>, and all that could <i>aunt nell</i> with understanding, upon the first <i>journo</i> of the <i>setterth</i> month.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>varda the lavs</i> therein before the street that was before the <i>aqua</i> gate from the morning until midday, before the <i>homies</i> and the <i>palones</i>, and those that could understand; and the <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> of all the <i>homies and palones</i> were attentive unto the <i>glossy</i> of the law.
    </li>
    <li>And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside <i>her</i> stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on <i>her</i> <i>sweet martini</i>; and on <i>her</i> <i>dry martini</i>, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam.
    </li>
    <li>And Ezra opened the <i>glossy</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of all the <i>homies and palones</i>; (for <i>she</i> was above all the <i>homies and palones</i>😉 and when <i>she</i> opened it, all the <i>homies and palones</i> stood up:
    </li>
    <li>And Ezra <i>fabed</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, the <i>dowry</i> <i>Gloria</i>. And all the <i>homies and palones</i> answered, <i>Larlou</i>, <i>Larlou</i>, with lifting up their <i>fambles</i>: and they bowed their <i>ekes</i>, and worshipped the <i>Duchess</i> with their <i>ekes</i> to the ground.
    </li>
    <li>Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the <i>homies and palones</i> to understand the law: and the <i>homies and palones</i> stood in their place.
    </li>
    <li>So they <i>varda the lavs</i> in the <i>glossy</i> in the law of <i>Gloria</i> distinctly, and <i>parkered</i> the sense, and caused them to understand the <i>vardaing the lavs</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the <i>godly homie</i> the scribe, and the Levites that taught the <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>cackled</i> unto all the <i>homies and palones</i>, This <i>journo</i> is <i>fabulosa</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i>; mourn not, <i>nishta</i> <i>parnie</i>. For all the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>parnied</i>, when they <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>lavs</i> of the law.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>troll</i> your way, <i>jarry</i> the fat, and <i>buvare</i> the <i>bona</i>, and <i>lau</i> portions unto them for whom <i>nishter</i> is prepared: for this <i>journo</i> is <i>fabulosa</i> unto our <i>Duchess</i>: <i>nishta</i> be ye sorry; for the joy of the <i>Duchess</i> is your <i>butchness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So the Levites stilled all the <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Hold your peace, for the <i>journo</i> is <i>fabulosa</i>; <i>nishta</i> be ye grieved.
    </li>
    <li>And all the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>trolled</i> their way to <i>jarry</i>, and to <i>buvare</i>, and to <i>lau</i> portions, and to make <i>dowry</i> mirth, because they had understood the <i>lavs</i> that were <i>screeched</i> unto them.
    </li>
    <li>And on the second <i>journo</i> were gathered together the <i>dowriest</i> of the <i>aunties</i> of all the <i>homies and palones</i>, the <i>godly homies</i>, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even to understand the <i>lavs</i> of the law.
    </li>
    <li>And they found <i>screeved</i> in the law which the <i>Duchess</i> had commanded by <i>Maureen</i>, that the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel should <i>lett</i> in booths in the <i>dowry munjarlee</i> of the <i>setterth</i> month:
    </li>
    <li>And that they should publish and proclaim in all their <i>smokes</i>, and in Jerusalem, <i>cackling</i>, <i>troll forth</i> unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is <i>screeved</i>.

    <li>So the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>trolled</i> forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every <i>una</i> upon the roof of <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>, and in their courts, and in the courts of the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and in the street of the <i>aqua</i> gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim.

    <li>And all the <i>punters</i> of them that were <i>troll</i> again out of the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Jeshua the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nun unto that <i>journo</i> had not the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel done so. And there was <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry</i> gladness.
    </li>
    <li>Also <i>journo</i> by <i>journo</i>, from the first <i>journo</i> unto the last <i>journo</i>, <i>she</i> <i>varda the lavs</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the law of <i>Gloria</i>. And they kept the <i>dowry munjarlee</i> <i>setter</i> days; and on the <i>otterth</i> <i>journo</i> was a solemn assembly, according unto the manner.

    <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now in the <i>dewey dacha</i> and <i>quarter</i> <i>journo</i> of this month the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel were assembled with <i>nistha manjarrying</i>, and with sackclothes, and earth upon them.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>maria</i> of Israel separated themselves from all strangers, and stood and confessed their <i>kertervers</i>, and the <i>cods</i> of their <i>aunties</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they stood up in their place, and <i>varda the lavs</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the law of the <i>Duchess</i> their <i>Gloria</i> <i>una</i> <i>quarter</i> part of the <i>journo</i>; and another <i>quarter</i> part they confessed, and worshipped the <i>Duchess</i> their <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and <i>screeched</i> with a loud <i>cackling fakement</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i> their <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, <i>cackled</i>, Stand up and bless the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i> for ever and ever: and <i>fabed</i> be thy <i>fabe</i> name, which is exalted above all <i>bona lav</i> and praise.
    </li>
    <li>Thou, even thou, art <i>Duchess</i> alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all <i>fakements</i> that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee.
    </li>
    <li>Thou art the <i>Duchess</i> the <i>Gloria</i>, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest <i>her</i> forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest <i>her</i> the name of Abraham;
    </li>
    <li>And foundest <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> <i>fabulous</i> before thee, and madest a covenant with <i>her</i> to <i>parker</i> the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to <i>parker</i> it, I <i>cackle</i>, to <i>her</i> <i>maria</i>, and hast performed thy <i>lavs</i>; for thou art <i>bona</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And didst <i>varda</i> the affliction of our <i>aunties</i> in Egypt, and heardest their <i>screech</i> by the Red sea;
    </li>
    <li>And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>, and on all the <i>homies and palones</i> of <i>her</i> land: for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a name, as it is this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they <i>trolled</i> through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the <i>dowry butch</i> <i>aquas</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover thou leddest them in the <i>journo</i> by a cloudy pillar; and in the <i>nochy</i> by a pillar of <i>binco fakement</i>, to <i>parker</i> them <i>sparkle</i> in the way wherein they should <i>troll</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them <i>sweet</i> judgments, and true laws, <i>bona</i> <i>dowry lavs</i> and <i>butch lavs</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And madest known unto them thy <i>fabulosa</i> sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, <i>dowry lavs</i>, and laws, by the <i>famble</i> of <i>Maureen</i> thy <i>serving homie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And gavest them <i>pannan</i> from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth <i>aqua</i> for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promisedst them that they should <i>troll</i> in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to <i>parker</i> them.
    </li>
    <li>But they and our <i>aunties</i> dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and <i>aunt nelled</i> not to thy <i>butch lavs</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And refused to obey, <i>nishta</i> were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to <i>troll back to</i> their bondage: but thou art a <i>Gloria</i> ready to pardon, <i>bona</i> and merciful, slow to <i>wild</i>, and of <i>dowry</i> kindness, and forsookest them not.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when they had made them a molten calf, and <i>cackled</i>, This is thy <i>Gloria</i> that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought <i>dowry</i> provocations;
    </li>
    <li>Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the <i>nishta smoke</i>: the pillar of the cloud <i>trolled off</i> not from them by <i>journo</i>, to lead them in the way; <i>nishta</i> the pillar of <i>binco fakement</i> by <i>nochy</i>, to shew them <i>sparkle</i>, and the way wherein they should <i>troll</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thou gavest also thy <i>bona</i> <i>Fairy</i> to instruct them, and withheldest not thy <i>pannan</i> from their <i>screech</i>, and gavest them <i>aqua</i> for their thirst.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, <i>quarter dacha</i> years didst thou sustain them in the <i>nishta smoke</i>, so that they lacked <i>nishter</i>; their <i>zhoosh</i> waxed not <i>badge</i>, and their <i>plates</i> swelled not.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Heshbon, and the land of Og <i>dowriest homie</i> of Bashan.
    </li>
    <li>Their <i>chavvies</i> also multipliedst thou as the <i>twinkling fakements</i> of heaven, and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their <i>aunties</i>, that they should <i>troll</i> in to possess it.
    </li>
    <li>So the <i>chavvies</i> <i>trolled</i> in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their <i>fambles</i>, with their <i>dowriest homies</i>, and the <i>homies and palones</i> of the land, that they might do with them as they would.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>lelled</i> <i>butch</i> <i>smokes</i>, and a fat land, and possessed <i>latties</i> full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did <i>jarry</i>, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy <i>dowry</i> goodness.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought <i>dowry</i> provocations.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore thou deliveredst them into the <i>famble</i> of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they <i>screeched</i> unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours, who saved them out of the <i>famble</i> of their enemies.
    </li>
    <li>But after they had <i>lettie</i>, they did <i>nana</i> again before thee: therefore leftest thou them in the land of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they <i>trolled back</i>, and <i>screeched</i> unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies;
    </li>
    <li>And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest <i>parker</i> them again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and <i>aunt nelled</i> not unto thy <i>butch lavs</i>, but <i>kertervered</i> against thy judgments, (which if a <i>homie</i> do, <i>she</i> shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not <i>aunt nell</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against them by thy <i>Fairy</i> in thy prophets: yet would they not <i>parker</i> <i>aunt nelling cheat</i>: therefore gavest thou them into the <i>famble</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i> of the lands.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> for thy <i>dowry</i> mercies&#8217; sake thou didst not utterly consume them, <i>nishta</i> forsake them; for thou art a <i>bona</i> and merciful <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now therefore, our <i>Gloria</i>, the <i>dowry</i>, the <i>dowry butch</i>, and the <i>nanna</i> <i>Gloria</i>, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem <i>bijou</i> before thee, that hath <i>troll</i> upon us, on our <i>dowriest homies</i>, on our <i>princesses</i>, and on our <i>godly homies</i>, and on our prophets, and on our <i>aunties</i>, and on all thy <i>homies and palones</i>, since the time of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Assyria unto this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou hast done <i>sweet</i>, but we have done wickedly:
    </li>
    <li><i>Nishta</i> have our <i>dowriest homies</i>, our <i>princesses</i>, our <i>godly homies</i>, <i>nishta</i> our <i>aunties</i>, kept thy law, <i>nishta</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> unto thy <i>butch lavs</i> and thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them.
    </li>
    <li>For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy <i>dowry</i> goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, <i>nishta</i> turned they from their <i>naff</i> works.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, we are <i>serving homies</i> this <i>journo</i>, and for the land that thou gavest unto our <i>aunties</i> to <i>jarry</i> the fruit thereof and the <i>bona</i> thereof, <i>varda</i>, we are <i>serving homies</i> in it:
    </li>
    <li>And it yieldeth <i>dowry</i> increase unto the <i>dowriest homies</i> whom thou hast set over us because of our <i>kertervers</i>: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in <i>dowry</i> distress.
    </li>
    <li>And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and <i>screeve</i> it; and our <i>princesses</i>, Levites, and <i>godly homies</i>, seal unto it.

    </li>
    <li>Shemaiah, and Joiarib, Jedaiah,
    </li>
    <li>Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah. These were the <i>dowriest</i> of the <i>godly homies</i> and of their <i>sisters</i> in the days of Jeshua.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, which was over the thanksgiving, <i>she</i> and <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their <i>sisters</i>, were over against them in the watches.
    </li>
    <li>And Jeshua <i>chavvied</i> Joiakim, Joiakim also <i>chavvied</i> Eliashib, and Eliashib <i>chavvied</i> Joiada,
    </li>
    <li>And Joiada <i>chavvied</i> Jonathan, and Jonathan <i>chavvied</i> Jaddua.
    </li>
    <li>And in the days of Joiakim were <i>godly homies</i>, the <i>dowriest</i> of the <i>aunties</i>: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;
    </li>
    <li>Of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;
    </li>
    <li>Of Melicu, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, <i>Josephine</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai;
    </li>
    <li>Of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam;

    </li>
    <li>The Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and Jaddua, were recorded <i>dowriest</i> of the <i>aunties</i>: also the <i>godly homies</i>, to the reign of Darius the Persian.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>homie chavvies</i> of Levi, the <i>dowriest</i> of the <i>aunties</i>, were <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Eliashib.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest</i> of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Kadmiel, with their <i>sisters</i> over against them, to praise and to <i>parker</i> thanks, according to the <i>butch lav</i> of <i>Davina</i> the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, ward over against ward.
    </li>
    <li>Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were porters keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates.
    </li>
    <li>These were in the days of Joiakim the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jeshua, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the <i>godly homie</i>, the scribe.
    </li>
    <li>And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to <i>parker</i> them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>homie chavvies</i> of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain country round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of Netophathi;
    </li>
    <li>Also from the <i>lattie</i> of Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages round about Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>godly homies</i> and the Levites purified themselves, and purified the <i>homies and palones</i>, and the gates, and the wall.
    </li>
    <li>Then I brought up the <i>princesses</i> of Judah upon the wall, and appointed <i>dewey</i> <i>dowry</i> companies of them that <i>parkered</i> thanks, whereof <i>una</i> <i>trolled</i> on the <i>sweet martini</i> upon the wall toward the dung gate:
    </li>
    <li>And after them <i>trolled</i> Hoshaiah, and half of the <i>princesses</i> of Judah,
    </li>
    <li>And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,
    </li>
    <li>Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,
    </li>
    <li>And certain of the <i>godly homies</i>&#8216; <i>homie chavvies</i> with trumpets; namely, Zechariah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jonathan, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Shemaiah, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Mattaniah, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Michaiah, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Zaccur, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Asaph:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of <i>Davina</i> the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and Ezra the scribe before them.
    </li>
    <li>And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they <i>trolled</i> up by the stairs of the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i>, at the going up of the wall, above the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Davina</i>, even unto the <i>aqua</i> gate eastward.
    </li>
    <li>And the other company of them that <i>parkered</i> thanks <i>trolled</i> over against them, and I after them, and the half of the <i>homies and palones</i> upon the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall;
    </li>
    <li>And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the <i>badge</i> gate, and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still in the <i>charpering carsey</i> gate.
    </li>
    <li>So stood the <i>dewey</i> companies of them that <i>parkered</i> thanks in the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and I, and the half of the rulers with me:
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>godly homies</i>; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;
    </li>
    <li>And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.
    </li>
    <li>Also that <i>journo</i> they offered <i>dowry</i> <i>parkers</i>, and rejoiced: for <i>Gloria</i> had made them rejoice with <i>dowry</i> joy: the <i>palone affairs</i> also and the <i>chavvies</i> rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was <i>aunt nelled</i> even <i>nishta ajax</i> off.
    </li>
    <li>And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the <i>gelt</i>, for the <i>parkerings</i>, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the <i>smokes</i> the portions of the law for the <i>godly homies</i> and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the <i>godly homies</i> and for the Levites that waited.
    </li>
    <li>And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their <i>Gloria</i>, and the ward of the purification, according to the <i>butch lav</i> of <i>Davina</i>, and of Solomon <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For in the days of <i>Davina</i> and Asaph of <i>badge</i> there were <i>dowriest</i> of the singers, and <i>chants</i> of praise and thanksgiving unto <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, <i>parkered</i> the portions of the singers and the porters, every <i>journo</i> <i>her</i> portion: and they sanctified <i>fabulosa</i> <i>fakements</i> unto the Levites; and the Levites sanctified them unto the <i>chavvies</i> of Aaron.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 13</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>On that <i>journo</i> they <i>varda the lavs</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of <i>Maureen</i> in the audience of the <i>homies and palones</i>; and therein was found <i>screeved</i>, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not <i>troll</i> into the <i>punters</i> of <i>Gloria</i> for ever;
    </li>
    <li>Because they met not the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel with <i>pannan</i> and with <i>aqua</i>, but hired Balaam against them, that <i>she</i> should curse them: howbeit our <i>Gloria</i> turned the curse into a <i>bona lav</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now it <i>trolled</i> to pass, when they had <i>aunt nelled</i> the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.
    </li>
    <li>And before this, Eliashib the <i>godly homie</i>, having the oversight of the <i>booth</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of our <i>Gloria</i>, was allied unto Tobiah:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> had prepared for <i>her</i> a <i>dowry</i> <i>booth</i>, where aforetime they <i>laued</i> the <i>carnish</i> <i>parkerings</i>, the frankincense, and the <i>fakements</i>, and the tithes of the corn, the new <i>sherry</i>, and the <i>lube</i>, which was commanded to be <i>parkered</i> to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the <i>parkerings</i> of the <i>godly homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem: for in the <i>dewey</i> and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon <i>trolled</i> I unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and after certain days obtained I leave of the <i>dowriest homie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>trolled</i> to Jerusalem, and understood of the <i>nana</i> that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing <i>her</i> a <i>booth</i> in the courts of the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff to Tobiah out of the <i>booth</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the <i>fakements</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, with the <i>carnish</i> <i>parkering</i> and the frankincense.
    </li>
    <li>And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been <i>parkered</i> them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the <i>acting dickey</i>, were fled every <i>una</i> to <i>her</i> field.
    </li>
    <li>Then contended I with the rulers, and <i>cackled</i>, Why is the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.
    </li>
    <li>Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new <i>sherry</i> and the <i>lube</i> unto the treasuries.
    </li>
    <li>And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the <i>godly homie</i>, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Zaccur, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Mattaniah: for they were counted <i>fabulous</i>, and their office was to distribute unto their <i>sisters</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Remember me, O my <i>Gloria</i>, concerning this, and wipe not out my <i>bona</i> deeds that I have done for the <i>lattie</i> of my <i>Gloria</i>, and for the offices thereof.
    </li>
    <li>In those days <i>vardad</i> I in Judah some treading <i>sherry</i> presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also <i>sherry</i>, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath <i>journo</i>: and I testified against them in the <i>journo</i> wherein they sold victuals.
    </li>
    <li>There <i>letted</i> <i>homies</i> of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the <i>chavvies</i> of Judah, and in Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and <i>cackled</i> unto them, What <i>nana</i> <i>fakement</i> is this that ye do, and <i>billingsgate</i> the sabbath <i>journo</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Did not your <i>aunties</i> thus, and did not our <i>Gloria</i> <i>parker</i> all this <i>nana</i> upon us, and upon this <i>smoke</i>? yet ye <i>parker</i> more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my <i>serving homies</i> set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So the <i>bodega homies</i> and sellers of all kind of ware lodged <i>nanti</i> Jerusalem once or twice.
    </li>
    <li>Then I testified against them, and <i>cackled</i> unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will <i>lett</i> <i>fambles</i> on you. From that time forth <i>trolled</i> they <i>nishta</i> on the sabbath.
    </li>
    <li>And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should <i>troll</i> and keep the gates, to <i>bonafy</i> the sabbath <i>journo</i>. Remember me, O my <i>Gloria</i>, concerning this also, and spare me according to the <i>dowriness</i> of thy mercy.
    </li>
    <li>In those days also <i>vardad</i> I <i>kosher homies</i> that had married <i>palone affairs</i> of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:
    </li>
    <li>And their <i>chavvies</i> <i>cackled</i> half in the <i>cackle</i> of Ashdod, and could not <i>cackle</i> in the <i>kosher homies</i>&#8216; language, but according to the language of each <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And I contended with them, and cursed them, and <i>slapped</i> certain of them, and plucked off their <i>riah</i>, and made them swear by <i>Gloria</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>nanti</i> <i>parker</i> your <i>palone chavvies</i> unto their <i>homie chavvies</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>lell</i> their <i>palone chavvies</i> unto your <i>homie chavvies</i>, or for yourselves.
    </li>
    <li>Did not Solomon <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel <i>kertever</i> by these <i>fakements</i>? yet among many nations was there no <i>dowriest homie</i> like <i>her</i>, who was beloved of <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i>, and <i>Gloria</i> made <i>her</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> over all Israel: <i>any road up</i> even <i>her</i> did outlandish <i>palones</i> cause to <i>kertever</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Shall we then <i>aunt nell</i> unto you to do all this <i>dowry</i> <i>nana</i>, to transgress against our <i>Gloria</i> in marrying strange <i>palone affairs</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>una</i> of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Joiada, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Eliashib the high <i>godly homie</i>, was <i>homie chavvie</i> in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased <i>her</i> from me.
    </li>
    <li>Remember them, O my <i>Gloria</i>, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.
    </li>
    <li>Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the <i>godly homies</i> and the Levites, every <i>una</i> in <i>her</i> business;
    </li>
    <li>And for the wood <i>parkering</i>, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my <i>Gloria</i>, for <i>bona</i>.
