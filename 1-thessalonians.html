    <h1>1 Thessalonians</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Pauline</i>, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the <i>meshigener carsey</i> of the Thessalonians which is in <i>Gloria</i> the <i>Auntie</i> and in the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>: <i>gracie</i> be unto you, and peace, from <i>Gloria</i> our <i>Auntie</i>, and the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>We <i>parker</i> thanks to <i>Gloria</i> always for you all, <i>dishing the dirt on</i> you in our <i>meshigener mutterings</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Remembering <i>nanti</i> ceasing your <i>acting dickey</i> of faith, and <i>acting dickey</i> of love, and patience of hope in our <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, in the <i>vardaing</i> of <i>Gloria</i> and our <i>Auntie</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Knowing, <i>sisters</i> beloved, your election of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For our <i>gossip</i> <i>trolled</i> not unto you in <i>lav</i> only, but also in power, and in the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>, and in <i>dowry</i> assurance; as ye know what manner of <i>homies</i> we were among you for your sake.
    </li>
    <li>And ye became followers of us, and of the <i>Duchess</i>, having <i>lalled</i> the <i>lav</i> in <i>dowry</i> affliction, with joy of the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.
    </li>
    <li>For from you sounded out the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to <i>Gloria</i>-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to <i>cackle</i> any <i>fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to <i>Gloria</i> from idols to serve the living and true <i>Gloria</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And to wait for <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> from heaven, whom <i>she</i> raised from the <i>stiff</i>, even <i>Josie</i>, which <i>laued</i> us from the wrath to <i>troll</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>For yourselves, <i>sisters</i>, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:
    </li>
    <li>But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our <i>Gloria</i> to <i>cackle</i> unto you the <i>gossip</i> of <i>Gloria</i> with <i>dowry</i> contention.
    </li>
    <li>For our exhortation was not of deceit, <i>nishta</i> of <i>nishta sparkle</i>, <i>nishta</i> in guile:
    </li>
    <li>But as we were allowed of <i>Gloria</i> to be put in trust with the <i>gossip</i>, even so we <i>cackle</i>; not as pleasing <i>homies</i>, but <i>Gloria</i>, which trieth our <i>thumping cheats</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>nishta</i> at any time used we flattering <i>lavs</i>, as ye know, <i>nishta</i> a cloke of <i>ogling</i>; <i>Gloria</i> is <i>varda-ing fakement</i>:
    </li>
    <li><i>Nishta</i> of <i>homies</i> sought we <i>fabeness</i>, <i>nishta</i> of you, <i>nishta</i> yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her <i>chavvies</i>:
    </li>
    <li>So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the <i>gossip</i> of <i>Gloria</i> only, but also our own <i>nishta lucoddies</i>, because ye were dear unto us.
    </li>
    <li>For ye remember, <i>sisters</i>, our <i>acting dickey</i> and travail: for labouring <i>nochy</i> and <i>journo</i>, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we <i>cackled</i> unto you the <i>gossip</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Ye are witnesses, and <i>Gloria</i> also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:
    </li>
    <li>As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every <i>una</i> of you, as a <i>Auntie</i> doth <i>her</i> <i>chavvies</i>,
    </li>
    <li>That ye would <i>mince</i> <i>bona</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, who hath <i>screeched</i> you unto <i>her</i> kingdom and <i>fabeness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For this cause also thank we <i>Gloria</i> <i>nanti</i> ceasing, because, when ye <i>lalled</i> the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i> which ye <i>aunt nelled</i> of us, ye <i>lalled</i> it not as the <i>lav</i> of <i>homies</i>, but as it is <i>no flies</i>, the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.
    </li>
    <li>For ye, <i>sisters</i>, became followers of the <i>meshigener carseys</i> of <i>Gloria</i> which in Judaea are in <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i>: for ye also have suffered like <i>fakements</i> of your own countrymen, even as they have of the <i>kosher homies</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Who both <i>ferricadozad</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i>, and their own prophets, and have <i>chivvied</i> us; and they please not <i>Gloria</i>, and are contrary to all <i>homies</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Forbidding us to <i>cackle</i> to the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> that they might be saved, to fill up their <i>kertervers</i> alway: for the wrath is <i>troll</i> upon them to the uttermost.
    </li>
    <li>But we, <i>sisters</i>, being <i>lelled</i> from you for a short time in presence, not in <i>thumping cheat</i>, endeavoured the more <i>dowrily</i> to <i>varda</i> your <i>eke</i> with <i>dowry</i> <i>fancy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore we would have <i>troll</i> unto you, even I <i>Pauline</i>, once and again; but <i>Sadie</i> hindered us.
    </li>
    <li>For what is our hope, or joy, or <i>mudge</i> of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> at <i>her</i> <i>trolling</i>?
    </li>
    <li>For ye are our <i>fabeness</i> and joy.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it <i>bona</i> to be <i>dry</i> at Athens alone;
    </li>
    <li>And <i>laued</i> Timotheus, our <i>sister</i>, and minister of <i>Gloria</i>, and our fellowlabourer in the <i>gossip</i> of <i>Crystal</i>, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:
    </li>
    <li>That no <i>homie</i> should be <i>trolled</i> by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.
    </li>
    <li>For verily, when we were with you, we <i>cackled</i> you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it <i>trolled</i> to pass, and ye know.
    </li>
    <li>For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I <i>laued</i> to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our <i>acting dickey</i> be in vain.
    </li>
    <li>But now when Timotheus <i>trolled</i> from you unto us, and brought us <i>bona</i> tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have <i>bona</i> remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to <i>varda</i> us, as we also to <i>varda</i> you:
    </li>
    <li>Therefore, <i>sisters</i>, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:
    </li>
    <li>For now we live, if ye stand <i>nishta manjarry</i> in the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For what thanks can we render to <i>Gloria</i> again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our <i>Gloria</i>;
    </li>
    <li><i>Nochy</i> and <i>journo</i> praying exceedingly that we might <i>varda</i> your <i>eke</i>, and might <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i> that which is lacking in your faith?
    </li>
    <li>Now <i>Gloria</i> himself and our <i>Auntie</i>, and our <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, direct our way unto you.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> make you to increase and abound in love <i>una</i> toward another, and toward all <i>homies</i>, even as we do toward you:
    </li>
    <li>To the end <i>she</i> may stablish your <i>thumping cheats</i> unblameable in holiness before <i>Gloria</i>, even our <i>Auntie</i>, at the <i>trolling</i> of our <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> with all <i>her</i> saints.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Furthermore then we beseech you, <i>sisters</i>, and exhort you by the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i>, that as ye have <i>lalled</i> of us how ye ought to <i>mince</i> and to please <i>Gloria</i>, so ye would abound more and more.
    </li>
    <li>For ye know what <i>butch lavs</i> we <i>parkered</i> you by the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For this is the will of <i>Gloria</i>, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from <i>charvering</i>:
    </li>
    <li>That every <i>una</i> of you should know how to possess <i>her</i> <i>fakement</i> in sanctification and honour;
    </li>
    <li>Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> which know not <i>Gloria</i>:
    </li>
    <li>That no <i>homie</i> <i>troll</i> beyond and defraud <i>her</i> <i>sister</i> in any matter: because that the <i>Duchess</i> is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>Gloria</i> hath not <i>screeched</i> us unto <i>nishta sparkle</i>, but unto holiness.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> therefore that despiseth, despiseth not <i>homie</i>, but <i>Gloria</i>, who hath also <i>parkered</i> unto us <i>her</i> <i>fabulosa</i> <i>Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But as <i>reefing</i> brotherly love ye need not that I <i>screeve</i> unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of <i>Gloria</i> to love <i>una</i> another.
    </li>
    <li>And indeed ye do it toward all the <i>sisters</i> which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, <i>sisters</i>, that ye increase more and more;
    </li>
    <li>And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to <i>acting dickey</i> with your own <i>fambles</i>, as we commanded you;
    </li>
    <li>That ye may <i>mince</i> honestly toward them that are <i>nanti</i>, and that ye may have lack of <i>nishter</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But I would not have you to be ignorant, <i>sisters</i>, concerning them which are asleep, that ye <i>sharda</i> not, even as others which have no hope.
    </li>
    <li>For if we believe that <i>Josie</i> <i>carked it</i> and rose again, even so them also which <i>letty</i> in <i>Josie</i> will <i>Gloria</i> <i>parker</i> with <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For this we <i>cackle</i> unto you by the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, that we which are alive and remain unto the <i>trolling</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> shall not prevent them which are asleep.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>Duchess</i> himself shall <i>troll down</i> from heaven with a <i>screech</i>, with the <i>cackling fakement</i> of the archangel, and with the trump of <i>Gloria</i>: and the <i>stiff</i> in <i>Crystal</i> shall rise first:
    </li>
    <li>Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the <i>Duchess</i> in the air: and so shall we ever be with the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore comfort <i>una</i> another with these <i>lavs</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>But of the times and the seasons, <i>sisters</i>, ye have no need that I <i>screeve</i> unto you.
    </li>
    <li>For yourselves know perfectly that the <i>journo</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> so <i>trolleth</i> as a <i>sharpering homie</i> in the <i>nochy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For when they shall <i>cackle</i>, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction <i>trolleth</i> upon them, as travail upon a <i>palone</i> <i>up the duff</i>; and they shall not escape.
    </li>
    <li>But ye, <i>sisters</i>, are not in <i>munge</i>, that that <i>journo</i> should overtake you as a <i>sharpering homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Ye are all the <i>chavvies</i> of <i>sparkle</i>, and the <i>chavvies</i> of the <i>journo</i>: we are not of the <i>nochy</i>, <i>nishta</i> of <i>munge</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore let us not <i>letty</i>, as do others; but let us <i>varda</i> and be sober.
    </li>
    <li>For they that <i>letty</i> <i>letty</i> in the <i>nochy</i>; and they that be <i>daffy</i> are <i>daffy</i> in the <i>nochy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But let us, who are of the <i>journo</i>, be sober, putting on the <i>basque</i> of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>Gloria</i> hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Who <i>carked it</i> for us, that, whether we wake or <i>letty</i>, we should live together with <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify <i>una</i> another, even as also ye do.
    </li>
    <li>And we beseech you, <i>sisters</i>, to know them which <i>acting dickey</i> among you, and are over you in the <i>Duchess</i>, and admonish you;
    </li>
    <li>And to esteem them <i>dowry</i> highly in love for their <i>acting dickey</i>&#8216;s sake. And be at peace among yourselves.
    </li>
    <li>Now we exhort you, <i>sisters</i>, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the <i>nelly</i>, be patient toward all <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i> that none render <i>nana</i> for <i>nana</i> unto any <i>homie</i>; but ever <i>troll after</i> that which is <i>bona</i>, both among yourselves, and to all <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Rejoice evermore.
    </li>
    <li>Pray <i>nanti</i> ceasing.
    </li>
    <li>In every <i>fakement</i> <i>parker</i> thanks: for this is the will of <i>Gloria</i> in <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i> concerning you.
    </li>
    <li>Quench not the <i>Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Despise not prophesyings.
    </li>
    <li>Prove all <i>fakements</i>; hold <i>nishta manjarry</i> that which is <i>bona</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Abstain from all appearance of <i>nana</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowry</i> <i>Gloria</i> of peace <i>bonafy</i> you wholly; and I pray <i>Gloria</i> your whole <i>Fairy</i> and <i>nishta lucoddy</i> and <i>lucoddy</i> be preserved blameless unto the <i>trolling</i> of our <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Fabulous</i> is <i>she</i> that <i>screecheth</i> you, who also will do it.
    </li>
    <li><i>Sisters</i>, pray for us.
    </li>
    <li>Greet all the <i>sisters</i> with an <i>fabulosa</i> kiss.
    </li>
    <li>I charge you by the <i>Duchess</i> that this epistle be <i>varda the lavs</i> unto all the <i>fabulosa</i> <i>sisters</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>gracie</i> of our <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> be with you. <i>Larlou</i>.
