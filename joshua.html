    <h1>Joshua</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>Now after the <i>carking it</i> of <i>Maureen</i> the <i>serving homie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> it <i>trolled</i> to pass, that the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Joshua the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nun, <i>Maureen</i>&#8216; minister, <i>cackling</i>,
  </li>
  <li><i>Maureen</i> my <i>serving homie</i> is <i>stiff</i>; now therefore arise, <i>troll</i> over this Jordan, thou, and all this <i>homies and palones</i>, unto the land which I do <i>parker</i> to them, even to the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel.
  </li>
  <li>Every place that the sole of your <i>plate</i> shall <i>mince</i> upon, that have I <i>parkered</i> unto you, as I <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Maureen</i>.
  </li>
  <li>From the <i>nishta smoke</i> and this Lebanon even unto the <i>dowry</i> river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the <i>dowry</i> sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.
  </li>
  <li>There shall not any <i>homie</i> be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with <i>Maureen</i>, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, <i>nishta</i> forsake thee.
  </li>
  <li>Be <i>butch</i> and of a <i>bona</i> courage: for unto this <i>homies and palones</i> shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their <i>aunties</i> to <i>parker</i> them.
  </li>
  <li>Only be thou <i>butch</i> and <i>dowry</i> courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which <i>Maureen</i> my <i>serving homie</i> commanded thee: turn not from it to the <i>sweet martini</i> or to the <i>dry</i>, that thou mayest prosper withersoever thou <i>trollest</i>.
  </li>
  <li>This <i>glossy</i> of the law shall not <i>troll off</i> out of thy <i>screech</i>; but thou shalt meditate therein <i>journo</i> and <i>nochy</i>, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is <i>screeved</i> therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have <i>bona</i> success.
  </li>
  <li>Have not I commanded thee? Be <i>butch</i> and of a <i>bona</i> courage; be not afraid, <i>nishta</i> be thou dismayed: for the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> is with thee whithersoever thou <i>trollest</i>.
  </li>
  <li>Then Joshua commanded the <i>hilda handcuffs</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>cackling</i>,
  </li>
  <li>Pass through the host, and command the <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Prepare you victuals; for within <i>trey</i> days ye shall <i>troll over</i> this Jordan, to <i>troll</i> in to possess the land, which the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i> giveth you to possess it.
  </li>
  <li>And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, <i>cackled</i> Joshua, <i>cackling</i>,
  </li>
  <li>Remember the <i>lav</i> which <i>Maureen</i> the <i>serving homie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> commanded you, <i>cackling</i>, The <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>parkered</i> you <i>lettie</i>, and hath <i>parkered</i> you this land.
  </li>
  <li>Your <i>palone affairs</i>, your <i>bijou</i> ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which <i>Maureen</i> <i>parkered</i> you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your <i>sisters</i> armed, all the <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i> of valour, and help them;
  </li>
  <li>Until the <i>Duchess</i> have <i>parkered</i> your <i>sisters</i> <i>lettie</i>, as <i>she</i> hath <i>parkered</i> you, and they also have possessed the land which the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i> giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your <i>fakement</i>, and enjoy it, which <i>Maureen</i> the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s <i>serving homie</i> <i>parkered</i> you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.
  </li>
  <li>And they answered Joshua, <i>cackling</i>, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will <i>troll</i>.
  </li>
  <li>According as we <i>aunt nelled</i> unto <i>Maureen</i> in all <i>fakements</i>, so will we <i>aunt nell</i> unto thee: only the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> be with thee, as <i>she</i> was with <i>Maureen</i>.
  </li>
  <li>Whosoever <i>she</i> be that doth rebel against thy <i>butch lav</i>, and will not <i>aunt nell</i> unto thy <i>lavs</i> in all that thou commandest <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> shall be put to <i>carking it</i>: only be <i>butch</i> and of a <i>bona</i> courage.
  </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>And Joshua the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nun <i>laued</i> out of Shittim <i>dewey</i> <i>homies</i> to spy secretly, <i>cackling</i>, <i>troll</i> view the land, even Jericho. And they <i>trolled</i>, and <i>trolled</i> into an <i>charvering donna</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, named Rahab, and lodged there.
  </li>
  <li>And it was <i>cackled</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Jericho, <i>cackling</i>, <i>varda</i>, there <i>trolled</i> <i>homies</i> in hither to <i>nochy</i> of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel to search out the country.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Jericho <i>laued</i> unto Rahab, <i>cackling</i>, <i>parker</i> forth the <i>homies</i> that are <i>troll</i> to thee, which are entered into thine <i>lattie</i>: for they be <i>troll</i> to search out all the country.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>palone</i> <i>lelled</i> the <i>dewey</i> <i>homies</i>, and hid them, and <i>cackled</i> thus, There <i>trolled</i> <i>homies</i> unto me, but I wist not whence they were:
  </li>
  <li><i>Any road up</i> about the time of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the <i>homies</i> <i>trolled</i> out: whither the <i>homies</i> <i>trolled</i> I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.
  </li>
  <li>But she had brought them up to the roof of the <i>lattie</i>, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had <i>laued</i> in order upon the roof.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>homies</i> pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were <i>trolled</i> out, they shut the gate.
  </li>
  <li>And before they were <i>laued</i> down, she <i>trolled</i> up unto them upon the roof;
  </li>
  <li>And she <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>homies</i>, I know that the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>parkered</i> you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.
  </li>
  <li>For we have <i>aunt nelled</i> how the <i>Duchess</i> dried up the <i>aqua</i> of the Red sea for you, when ye <i>trolled</i> out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the <i>dewey</i> <i>dowriest homies</i> of the Amorites, that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly <i>battyfanged</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And as soon as we had <i>aunt nelled</i> these <i>fakements</i>, our <i>thumping cheats</i> did melt, <i>nishta</i> did there remain any more courage in any <i>homie</i>, because of you: for the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i>, <i>she</i> is <i>Gloria</i> in heaven above, and in earth beneath.
  </li>
  <li>Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the <i>Duchess</i>, since I have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto my <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, and <i>parker</i> me a true token:
  </li>
  <li>And that ye will save alive my <i>Auntie</i>, and my mother, and my <i>sisters</i>, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from <i>carking it</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>homies</i> answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>parkered</i> us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.
  </li>
  <li>Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her <i>lattie</i> was upon the town wall, and she <i>letted</i> upon the wall.
  </li>
  <li>And she <i>cackled</i> unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there <i>trey</i> days, until the pursuers be <i>trolled back</i>: and afterward may ye <i>troll</i> your way.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>homies</i> <i>cackled</i> unto her, We will be blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear.
  </li>
  <li><i>Varda</i>, when we <i>troll</i> into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt <i>parker</i> thy <i>Auntie</i>, and thy mother, and thy <i>sisters</i>, and all thy <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s household, home unto thee.
  </li>
  <li>And it shall be, that whosoever shall <i>troll out</i> of the doors of thy <i>lattie</i> into the street, <i>her</i> blood shall be upon <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>, and we will be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the <i>lattie</i>, <i>her</i> blood shall be on our <i>eke</i>, if any <i>famble</i> be upon <i>her</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.
  </li>
  <li>And she <i>cackled</i>, According unto your <i>lavs</i>, so be it. And she <i>laued</i> them away, and they <i>trolled off</i>: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.
  </li>
  <li>And they <i>trolled</i>, and <i>trolled</i> unto the mountain, and <i>letted</i> there <i>trey</i> days, until the pursuers were <i>trolled back</i>: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.
  </li>
  <li>So the <i>dewey</i> <i>homies</i> <i>trolled back</i>, and <i>trolled down</i> from the mountain, and passed over, and <i>trolled</i> to Joshua the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nun, and <i>cackled</i> <i>her</i> all <i>fakements</i> that befell them:
  </li>
  <li>And they <i>cackled</i> unto Joshua, Truly the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>laued</i> into our <i>fambles</i> all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us.
  </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and <i>trolled</i> to Jordan, <i>she</i> and all the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.
  </li>
  <li><i>Any road up</i> after <i>trey</i> days, that the <i>hilda handcuffs</i> <i>trolled</i> through the host;
  </li>
  <li>And they commanded the <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>cackling</i>, When ye <i>varda</i> the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the covenant of the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i>, and the <i>godly homies</i> the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and <i>troll</i> after it.
  </li>
  <li>Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about <i>dewey</i> <i>mille</i> cubits by measure: <i>troll</i> not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must <i>troll</i>: for ye have not passed this way heretofore.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>bonafy</i> yourselves: for to morrow the <i>Duchess</i> will do wonders among you.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>godly homies</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>lell</i> up the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the covenant, and <i>troll over</i> before the <i>homies and palones</i>. And they <i>lelled</i> up the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the covenant, and <i>trolled</i> before the <i>homies and palones</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Joshua, This <i>journo</i> will I begin to magnify thee in the <i>vardaing</i> of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with <i>Maureen</i>, so I will be with thee.
  </li>
  <li>And thou shalt command the <i>godly homies</i> that bear the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the covenant, <i>cackling</i>, When ye are <i>troll</i> to the brink of the <i>aqua</i> of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, <i>troll</i> hither, and <i>aunt nell</i> the <i>lavs</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua <i>cackled</i>, Hereby ye shall know that the living <i>Gloria</i> is among you, and that <i>she</i> will <i>nanti</i> fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.
  </li>
  <li><i>Varda</i>, the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the covenant of the <i>Duchess</i> of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan.
  </li>
  <li>Now therefore <i>lell</i> you <i>kenza</i> <i>homies</i> out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a <i>homie</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, as soon as the soles of the <i>plates</i> of the <i>godly homies</i> that bear the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, the <i>Duchess</i> of all the earth, shall <i>lettie</i> in the <i>aquas</i> of Jordan, that the <i>aquas</i> of Jordan shall be cut off from the <i>aquas</i> that <i>troll</i> down from above; and they shall stand upon an heap.
  </li>
  <li><i>Any road up</i>, when the <i>homies and palones</i> removed from their <i>trolling letties</i>, to <i>troll over</i> Jordan, and the <i>godly homies</i> bearing the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the covenant before the <i>homies and palones</i>;
  </li>
  <li>And as they that bare the <i>bijou arkette</i> were <i>troll</i> unto Jordan, and the <i>plates</i> of the <i>godly homies</i> that bare the <i>bijou arkette</i> were dipped in the brim of the <i>aqua</i>, (for Jordan overfloweth all <i>her</i> banks all the time of harvest,)
  </li>
  <li>That the <i>aquas</i> which <i>trolled</i> down from above stood and rose up upon an heap <i>dowry</i> <i>nishter ajax</i> the <i>smoke</i> Adam, that is beside Zaretan: and those that <i>trolled</i> down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the <i>homies and palones</i> passed over <i>sweet</i> against Jericho.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>godly homies</i> that bare the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the covenant of the <i>Duchess</i> stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the <i>homies and palones</i> were passed clean over Jordan.
  </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
  <ol>
  <li><i>Any road up</i>, when all the <i>homies and palones</i> were clean passed over Jordan, that the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Joshua, <i>cackling</i>,
  </li>
  <li><i>Lell</i> you <i>kenza</i> <i>homies</i> out of the <i>homies and palones</i>, out of every tribe a <i>homie</i>,
  </li>
  <li>And command ye them, <i>cackling</i>, <i>lell</i> you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the <i>godly homies</i>&#8216; <i>plates</i> stood firm, <i>kenza</i> stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this <i>nochy</i>.
  </li>
  <li>Then Joshua <i>screeched</i> the <i>kenza</i> <i>homies</i>, whom <i>she</i> had prepared of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, out of every tribe a <i>homie</i>:
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>troll over</i> before the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i> into the midst of Jordan, and <i>lell</i> you up every <i>homie</i> of you a stone upon <i>her</i> shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel:
  </li>
  <li>That this may be a sign among you, that when your <i>chavvies</i> ask their <i>aunties</i> in time to <i>troll</i>, <i>cackling</i>, What mean ye by these stones?
  </li>
  <li>Then ye shall answer them, That the <i>aquas</i> of Jordan were cut off before the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the covenant of the <i>Duchess</i>; when it passed over Jordan, the <i>aquas</i> of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel for ever.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and <i>lelled</i> up <i>kenza</i> stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, and <i>lelled</i> them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and <i>laued</i> them down there.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua set up <i>kenza</i> stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the <i>plates</i> of the <i>godly homies</i> which bare the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this <i>journo</i>.
  </li>
  <li>For the <i>godly homies</i> which bare the <i>bijou arkette</i> stood in the midst of Jordan, until everything was finished that the <i>Duchess</i> commanded Joshua to <i>cackle</i> unto the <i>homies and palones</i>, according to all that <i>Maureen</i> commanded Joshua: and the <i>homies and palones</i> hasted and passed over.
  </li>
  <li><i>Any road up</i>, when all the <i>homies and palones</i> were clean passed over, that the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> passed over, and the <i>godly homies</i>, in the presence of the <i>homies and palones</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Reuben, and the <i>chavvies</i> of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, as <i>Maureen</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them:
  </li>
  <li>About <i>quarter dacha</i> <i>mille</i> prepared for <i>barney</i> passed over before the <i>Duchess</i> unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.
  </li>
  <li>On that <i>journo</i> the <i>Duchess</i> magnified Joshua in the <i>vardaing</i> of all Israel; and they feared <i>her</i>, as they feared <i>Maureen</i>, all the days of <i>her</i> life.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Joshua, <i>cackling</i>,
  </li>
  <li>Command the <i>godly homies</i> that bear the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the testimony, that they <i>troll</i> up out of Jordan.
  </li>
  <li>Joshua therefore commanded the <i>godly homies</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>troll</i> ye up out of Jordan.
  </li>
  <li><i>Any road up</i>, when the <i>godly homies</i> that bare the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the covenant of the <i>Duchess</i> were <i>troll</i> up out of the midst of Jordan, and the soles of the <i>godly homies</i>&#8216; <i>plates</i> were lifted up unto the dry land, that the <i>aquas</i> of Jordan <i>trolled back</i> unto their place, and flowed over all <i>her</i> banks, as they did before.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>trolled</i> up out of Jordan on the <i>dachath</i> <i>journo</i> of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.
  </li>
  <li>And those <i>kenza</i> stones, which they <i>lelled</i> out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, <i>cackling</i>, When your <i>chavvies</i> shall ask their <i>aunties</i> in time to <i>troll</i>, <i>cackling</i>, What mean these stones?
  </li>
  <li>Then ye shall let your <i>chavvies</i> know, <i>cackling</i>, Israel <i>trolled</i> over this Jordan on dry land.
  </li>
  <li>For the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i> dried up the <i>aquas</i> of Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i> did to the Red sea, which <i>she</i> dried up from before us, until we were <i>trolled</i> over:
  </li>
  <li>That all the <i>homies and palones</i> of the earth might know the <i>famble</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, that it is <i>dowry butch</i>: that ye might fear the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i> for ever.
  </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
  <ol>
  <li><i>Any road up</i>, when all the <i>dowriest homies</i> of the Amorites, which were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the <i>dowriest homies</i> of the Canaanites, which were by the sea, <i>aunt nelled</i> that the <i>Duchess</i> had dried up the <i>aquas</i> of Jordan from before the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, until we were passed over, that their <i>thumping cheat</i> melted, <i>nishta</i> was there <i>Fairy</i> in them any more, because of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel.
  </li>
  <li>At that time the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Joshua, Make thee sharp <i>efinks</i>, and circumcise again the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel the second time.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua made <i>her</i> sharp <i>efinks</i>, and <i>roundhead</i> the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.
  </li>
  <li>And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the <i>homies and palones</i> that <i>trolled</i> out of Egypt, that were males, even all the <i>homies</i> of <i>barney</i>, <i>carked it</i> in the <i>nishta smoke</i> by the way, after they <i>trolled</i> out of Egypt.
  </li>
  <li>Now all the <i>homies and palones</i> that <i>trolled</i> out were <i>roundhead</i>: but all the <i>homies and palones</i> that were born in the <i>nishta smoke</i> by the way as they <i>trolled</i> forth out of Egypt, them they had not <i>roundhead</i>.
  </li>
  <li>For the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>minced</i> <i>quarter dacha</i> years in the <i>nishta smoke</i>, till all the <i>homies and palones</i> that were <i>homies</i> of <i>barney</i>, which <i>trolled</i> out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the <i>cackling fakement</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>: unto whom the <i>Duchess</i> sware that <i>she</i> would not shew them the land, which the <i>Duchess</i> sware unto their <i>aunties</i> that <i>she</i> would <i>parker</i> us, a land that floweth with <i>gin and tonic</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And their <i>chavvies</i>, whom <i>she</i> raised up in their stead, them Joshua <i>roundhead</i>: for they were <i>cavalier</i>, because they had not <i>roundhead</i> them by the way.
  </li>
  <li><i>Any road up</i>, when they had done circumcising all the <i>homies and palones</i>, that they <i>letted</i> in their places in the camp, till they were whole.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Joshua, This <i>journo</i> have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is <i>screeched</i> Gilgal unto this <i>journo</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the <i>trollover</i> on the fourteenth <i>journo</i> of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.
  </li>
  <li>And they did <i>jarry</i> of the <i>badge</i> corn of the land on the morrow after the <i>trollover</i>, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame <i>journo</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>pannan</i> ceased on the morrow after they had <i>jarried</i> of the <i>badge</i> corn of the land; <i>nishta</i> had the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>pannan</i> any more; but they did <i>jarry</i> of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
  </li>
  <li><i>Any road up</i>, when Joshua was by Jericho, that <i>she</i> lifted up <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i> and looked, and, <i>varda</i>, there stood a <i>homie</i> over against <i>her</i> with <i>her</i> <i>dowry efink</i> drawn in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>: and Joshua <i>trolled</i> unto <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?
  </li>
  <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Nay; but as captain of the host of the <i>Duchess</i> am I now <i>troll</i>. And Joshua fell on <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> to the earth, and did worship, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, What <i>cackleth</i> my <i>Duchess</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i>?
  </li>
  <li>And the captain of the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s host <i>cackled</i> unto Joshua, Loose thy <i>slingback</i> from off thy <i>plate</i>; for the place whereon thou standest is <i>fabulosa</i>. And Joshua did so.
  </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>Now Jericho was <i>hettily</i> shut up because of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel: none <i>trolled</i> out, and none <i>trolled</i> in.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Joshua, <i>varda</i>, I have <i>parkered</i> into thine <i>famble</i> Jericho, and the <i>dowriest homie</i> thereof, and the <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i> of valour.
  </li>
  <li>And ye shall compass the <i>smoke</i>, all ye <i>homies</i> of <i>barney</i>, and <i>troll</i> round about the <i>smoke</i> once. Thus shalt thou do <i>sey</i> days.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>setter</i> <i>godly homies</i> shall bear before the <i>bijou arkette</i> <i>setter</i> trumpets of rams&#8217; <i>colins</i>: and the <i>setterth</i> <i>journo</i> ye shall compass the <i>smoke</i> <i>setter</i> times, and the <i>godly homies</i> shall blow with the trumpets.
  </li>
  <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram&#8217;s <i>colin</i>, and when ye <i>aunt nell</i> the sound of the <i>tooting fakement</i>, all the <i>homies and palones</i> shall <i>screech</i> with a <i>dowry</i> <i>screech</i>; and the wall of the <i>smoke</i> shall fall down flat, and the <i>homies and palones</i> shall <i>troll up</i> up every <i>homie</i> <i>hettie</i> before <i>her</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nun <i>screeched</i> the <i>godly homies</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>lell</i> up the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the covenant, and let <i>setter</i> <i>godly homies</i> bear <i>setter</i> trumpets of rams&#8217; <i>colins</i> before the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>homies and palones</i>, Pass on, and compass the <i>smoke</i>, and let <i>her</i> that is armed pass on before the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
  </li>
  <li><i>Any road up</i>, when Joshua had <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>homies and palones</i>, that the <i>setter</i> <i>godly homies</i> bearing the <i>setter</i> trumpets of rams&#8217; <i>colins</i> passed on before the <i>Duchess</i>, and blew with the trumpets: and the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the covenant of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled after</i> them.
  </li>
  <li>And the armed <i>homies</i> <i>trolled</i> before the <i>godly homies</i> that blew with the trumpets, and the rereward <i>trolled</i> after the <i>bijou arkette</i>, the <i>godly homies</i> going on, and blowing with the trumpets.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua had commanded the <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>nanti</i> <i>screech</i>, <i>nishta</i> make any <i>screech</i> with your <i>cackling fakement</i>, <i>nishta</i> shall any <i>lav</i> proceed out of your <i>screech</i>, until the <i>journo</i> I bid you <i>screech</i>; then shall ye <i>screech</i>.
  </li>
  <li>So the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> compassed the <i>smoke</i>, going about it once: and they <i>trolled</i> into the camp, and lodged in the camp.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the <i>godly homies</i> <i>lelled</i> up the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>setter</i> <i>godly homies</i> bearing <i>setter</i> trumpets of rams&#8217; <i>colins</i> before the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed <i>homies</i> <i>trolled</i> before them; but the rereward <i>trolled</i> after the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, the <i>godly homies</i> going on, and blowing with the trumpets.
  </li>
  <li>And the second <i>journo</i> they compassed the <i>smoke</i> once, and <i>trolled back</i> into the camp: so they did <i>sey</i> days.
  </li>
  <li><i>Any road up</i> on the <i>setterth</i> <i>journo</i>, that they rose early about the dawning of the <i>journo</i>, and compassed the <i>smoke</i> after the same manner <i>setter</i> times: only on that <i>journo</i> they compassed the <i>smoke</i> <i>setter</i> times.
  </li>
  <li><i>Any road up</i> at the <i>setterth</i> time, when the <i>godly homies</i> blew with the trumpets, Joshua <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>screech</i>; for the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>parkered</i> you the <i>smoke</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>smoke</i> shall be accursed, even it, and all that are therein, to the <i>Duchess</i>: only Rahab the <i>charvering donna</i> shall live, she and all that are with her in the <i>lattie</i>, because she hid the messengers that we <i>laued</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed <i>fakement</i>, lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye <i>lell</i> of the accursed <i>fakement</i>, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.
  </li>
  <li>But all the silver, and <i>gelt</i>, and <i>fakements</i> of brass and iron, are consecrated unto the <i>Duchess</i>: they shall <i>troll</i> into the treasury of the <i>Duchess</i>.
  </li>
  <li>So the <i>homies and palones</i> shouted when the <i>godly homies</i> blew with the trumpets: <i>any road up</i>, when the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> the sound of the <i>tooting fakement</i>, and the <i>homies and palones</i> shouted with a <i>dowry</i> <i>screech</i>, that the wall fell down flat, so that the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>trolled</i> up into the <i>smoke</i>, every <i>homie</i> <i>hettie</i> before <i>her</i>, and they <i>lelled</i> the <i>smoke</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And they utterly <i>battyfanged</i> all that was in the <i>smoke</i>, both <i>homie</i> and <i>palone</i>, <i>bean</i> and <i>badge</i>, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the <i>dowry efink</i>.
  </li>
  <li>But Joshua had <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>dewey</i> <i>homies</i> that had <i>vardad</i> out the country, <i>troll</i> into the <i>charvering donna</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, and <i>parker</i> out thence the <i>palone</i>, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>bean coves</i> that were spies <i>trolled</i> in, and brought out Rahab, and her <i>Auntie</i>, and her mother, and her <i>sisters</i>, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and <i>dry</i> them <i>nanti</i> the camp of Israel.
  </li>
  <li>And they burnt the <i>smoke</i> with <i>binco fakement</i>, and all that was therein: only the silver, and the <i>gelt</i>, and the <i>fakements</i> of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua saved Rahab the <i>charvering donna</i> alive, and her <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s household, and all that she had; and she <i>letteth</i> in Israel even unto this <i>journo</i>; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua <i>laued</i> to spy out Jericho.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua adjured them at that time, <i>cackling</i>, Cursed be the <i>homie</i> before the <i>Duchess</i>, that riseth up and buildeth this <i>smoke</i> Jericho: <i>she</i> shall <i>lett</i> the foundation thereof in <i>her</i> firstborn, and in <i>her</i> youngest <i>homie chavvie</i> shall <i>she</i> set up the gates of it.
  </li>
  <li>So the <i>Duchess</i> was with Joshua; and <i>her</i> fame was noised throughout all the country.
  </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>But the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel committed a <i>caterver</i> in the accursed <i>fakement</i>: for Achan, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Carmi, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Zabdi, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, <i>lelled</i> of the accursed <i>fakement</i>: and the <i>wild</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> was kindled against the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua <i>laued</i> <i>homies</i> from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven, on the east of Bethel, and <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>cackling</i>, <i>troll</i> up and view the country. And the <i>homies</i> <i>trolled</i> up and viewed Ai.
  </li>
  <li>And they <i>trolled back to</i> Joshua, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Let not all the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>troll</i> up; but let about <i>dewey</i> or <i>trey</i> <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i> <i>troll</i> up and <i>slap</i> Ai; and make not all the <i>homies and palones</i> to <i>acting dickey</i> thither; for they are but <i>nishta dowry</i>.
  </li>
  <li>So there <i>trolled</i> up thither of the <i>homies and palones</i> about <i>trey</i> <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i>: and they fled before the <i>homies</i> of Ai.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>homies</i> of Ai <i>slapped</i> of them about <i>trey dacha</i> and <i>sey</i> <i>homies</i>: for they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and <i>slapped</i> them in the going down: wherefore the <i>thumping cheats</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i> melted, and became as <i>aqua</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua rent <i>her</i> <i>zhoosh</i>, and fell to the earth upon <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> before the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> until the eventide, <i>she</i> and the <i>fungi</i> of Israel, and put dust upon their <i>ekes</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua <i>cackled</i>, Alas, O <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>, wherefore hast thou at all brought this <i>homies and palones</i> over Jordan, to deliver us into the <i>famble</i> of the Amorites, to <i>battyfang</i> us? would to <i>Gloria</i> we had been content, and <i>letted</i> on the other side Jordan!
  </li>
  <li>O <i>Duchess</i>, what shall I <i>cackle</i>, when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies!
  </li>
  <li>For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall <i>aunt nell</i> of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy <i>dowry</i> name?
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy <i>eke</i>?
  </li>
  <li>Israel hath <i>kertervered</i>, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even <i>lelled</i> of the accursed <i>fakement</i>, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff.
  </li>
  <li>Therefore the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: <i>nishta</i> will I be with you any more, except ye <i>battyfang</i> the accursed from among you.
  </li>
  <li>Up, <i>bonafy</i> the <i>homies and palones</i>, and <i>cackle</i>, <i>bonafy</i> yourselves against to morrow: for thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, There is an accursed <i>fakement</i> in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye <i>lell</i> away the accursed <i>fakement</i> from among you.
  </li>
  <li>In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the <i>Duchess</i> <i>lelleth</i> shall <i>troll</i> according to the families thereof; and the family which the <i>Duchess</i> shall <i>lell</i> shall <i>troll</i> by households; and the household which the <i>Duchess</i> shall <i>lell</i> shall <i>troll</i> <i>homie</i> by <i>homie</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And it shall be, that <i>she</i> that is <i>lelled</i> with the accursed <i>fakement</i> shall be burnt with <i>binco fakement</i>, <i>she</i> and all that <i>she</i> hath: because <i>she</i> hath transgressed the covenant of the <i>Duchess</i>, and because <i>she</i> hath wrought folly in Israel.
  </li>
  <li>So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was <i>lelled</i>:
  </li>
  <li>And <i>she</i> brought the family of Judah; and <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> the family of the Zarhites: and <i>she</i> brought the family of the Zarhites <i>homie</i> by <i>homie</i>; and Zabdi was <i>lelled</i>:
  </li>
  <li>And <i>she</i> brought <i>her</i> household <i>homie</i> by <i>homie</i>; and Achan, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Carmi, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Zabdi, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was <i>lelled</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua <i>cackled</i> unto Achan, My <i>homie chavvie</i>, <i>parker</i>, I pray thee, <i>fabeness</i> to the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, and make confession unto <i>her</i>; and <i>cackle</i> me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.
  </li>
  <li>And Achan answered Joshua, and <i>cackled</i>, Indeed I have <i>kertervered</i> against the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:
  </li>
  <li>When I <i>vardad</i> among the spoils a goodly Babylonish <i>frock</i>, and <i>dewey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>medzers</i> of silver, and a wedge of <i>gelt</i> of <i>chinker dacha</i> <i>medzers</i> weight, then I <i>ogled</i> them, and <i>lelled</i> them; and, <i>varda</i>, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my <i>trolling lettie</i>, and the silver under it.
  </li>
  <li>So Joshua <i>laued</i> messengers, and they ran unto the <i>trolling lettie</i>; and, <i>varda</i>, it was hid in <i>her</i> <i>trolling lettie</i>, and the silver under it.
  </li>
  <li>And they <i>lelled</i> them out of the midst of the <i>trolling lettie</i>, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, and <i>laued</i> them out before the <i>Duchess</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua, and all Israel with <i>her</i>, <i>lelled</i> Achan the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Zerah, and the silver, and the <i>frock</i>, and the wedge of <i>gelt</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>palone chavvies</i>, and <i>her</i> oxen, and <i>her</i> asses, and <i>her</i> sheep, and <i>her</i> <i>trolling lettie</i>, and all that <i>she</i> had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua <i>cackled</i>, Why hast thou troubled us? the <i>Duchess</i> shall trouble thee this <i>journo</i>. And all Israel stoned <i>her</i> with stones, and burned them with <i>binco fakement</i>, after they had stoned them with stones.
  </li>
  <li>And they raised over <i>her</i> a <i>dowry</i> heap of stones unto this <i>journo</i>. So the <i>Duchess</i> turned from the fierceness of <i>her</i> <i>wild</i>. Wherefore the name of that place was <i>screeched</i>, The valley of Achor, unto this <i>journo</i>.
  </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Joshua, Fear not, <i>nishta</i> be thou dismayed: <i>lell</i> all the <i>homies and palones</i> of <i>barney</i> with thee, and arise, <i>troll</i> up to Ai: <i>varda</i>, I have <i>parkered</i> into thy <i>famble</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Ai, and <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>smoke</i>, and <i>her</i> land:
  </li>
  <li>And thou shalt do to Ai and her <i>dowriest homie</i> as thou didst unto Jericho and her <i>dowriest homie</i>: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye <i>lell</i> for a prey unto yourselves: <i>lett</i> thee an ambush for the <i>smoke</i> behind it.
  </li>
  <li>So Joshua arose, and all the <i>homies and palones</i> of <i>barney</i>, to <i>troll</i> up against Ai: and Joshua chose out <i>trey dacha</i> <i>mille</i> <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i> of valour, and <i>laued</i> them away by <i>nochy</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>she</i> commanded them, <i>cackling</i>, <i>varda</i>, ye shall lie in wait against the <i>smoke</i>, even behind the <i>smoke</i>: <i>troll not</i> <i>dowry</i> <i>nishter ajax</i> the <i>smoke</i>, but be ye all ready:
  </li>
  <li>And I, and all the <i>homies and palones</i> that are with me, will approach unto the <i>smoke</i>: and it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, when they <i>troll</i> out against us, as at the first, that we will <i>scarper</i> before them,
  </li>
  <li>(For they will <i>troll</i> out after us) till we have drawn them from the <i>smoke</i>; for they will <i>cackle</i>, They <i>scarper</i> before us, as at the first: therefore we will <i>scarper</i> before them.
  </li>
  <li>Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the <i>smoke</i>: for the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i> will deliver it into your <i>famble</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And it shall be, when ye have <i>lelled</i> the <i>smoke</i>, that ye shall set the <i>smoke</i> on <i>binco fakement</i>: according to the <i>butch lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> shall ye do. <i>Varda</i>, I have commanded you.
  </li>
  <li>Joshua therefore <i>laued</i> them forth: and they <i>trolled</i> to lie in ambush, and <i>letted</i> between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that <i>nochy</i> among the <i>homies and palones</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the <i>homies and palones</i>, and <i>trolled</i> up, <i>she</i> and the <i>fungi</i> of Israel, before the <i>homies and palones</i> to Ai.
  </li>
  <li>And all the <i>homies and palones</i>, even the <i>homies and palones</i> of <i>barney</i> that were with <i>her</i>, <i>trolled</i> up, and drew <i>ajax</i>, and <i>trolled</i> before the <i>smoke</i>, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> about <i>chinker</i> <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i>, and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the <i>smoke</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And when they had set the <i>homies and palones</i>, even all the host that was on the north of the <i>smoke</i>, and their liers in wait on the west of the <i>smoke</i>, Joshua <i>trolled</i> that <i>nochy</i> into the midst of the valley.
  </li>
  <li><i>Any road up</i>, when the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Ai <i>vardad</i> it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the <i>homies</i> of the <i>smoke</i> <i>trolled</i> out against Israel to battle, <i>she</i> and all <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, at a time appointed, before the plain; but <i>she</i> wist not that there were liers in ambush against <i>her</i> behind the <i>smoke</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the <i>nishta smoke</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And all the <i>homies and palones</i> that were in Ai were <i>screeched</i> together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the <i>smoke</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And there was not a <i>homie</i> <i>dry</i> in Ai or Bethel, that <i>trolled</i> not out after Israel: and they <i>dry</i> the <i>smoke</i> open, and pursued after Israel.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in thy <i>famble</i> toward Ai; for I will <i>parker</i> it into thine <i>famble</i>. And Joshua stretched out the spear that <i>she</i> had in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> toward the <i>smoke</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as <i>she</i> had stretched out <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>: and they entered into the <i>smoke</i>, and <i>lelled</i> it, and hasted and set the <i>smoke</i> on <i>binco fakement</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And when the <i>homies</i> of Ai looked behind them, they <i>vardad</i>, and, <i>varda</i>, the smoke of the <i>smoke</i> <i>trolled up</i> up to heaven, and they had no power to <i>scarper</i> this way or that way: and the <i>homies and palones</i> that fled to the <i>nishta smoke</i> turned back upon the pursuers.
  </li>
  <li>And when Joshua and all Israel <i>vardad</i> that the ambush had <i>lelled</i> the <i>smoke</i>, and that the smoke of the <i>smoke</i> <i>trolled up</i>, then they turned again, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> the <i>homies</i> of Ai.
  </li>
  <li>And the other issued out of the <i>smoke</i> against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they <i>slapped</i> them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Ai they <i>lelled</i> alive, and brought <i>her</i> to Joshua.
  </li>
  <li><i>Any road up</i>, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the <i>nishta smoke</i> wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the <i>dowry efink</i>, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites <i>trolled back</i> unto Ai, and <i>slapped</i> it with the edge of the <i>dowry efink</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And so it was, that all that fell that <i>journo</i>, both of <i>homies</i> and <i>palones</i>, were <i>kenza</i> <i>mille</i>, even all the <i>homies</i> of Ai.
  </li>
  <li>For Joshua drew not <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> back, wherewith <i>she</i> stretched out the spear, until <i>she</i> had utterly <i>battyfanged</i> all the inhabitants of Ai.
  </li>
  <li>Only the cattle and the spoil of that <i>smoke</i> Israel <i>lelled</i> for a prey unto themselves, according unto the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> which <i>she</i> commanded Joshua.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation unto this <i>journo</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Ai <i>she</i> hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should <i>lell</i> <i>her</i> carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the <i>smoke</i>, and raise thereon a <i>dowry</i> heap of stones, that remaineth unto this <i>journo</i>.
  </li>
  <li>Then Joshua built an <i>grovelling fakement</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel in mount Ebal,
  </li>
  <li>As <i>Maureen</i> the <i>serving homie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> commanded the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, as it is <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the law of <i>Maureen</i>, an <i>grovelling fakement</i> of whole stones, over which no <i>homie</i> hath lift up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt <i>parkerings</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>, and sacrificed peace <i>parkerings</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>she</i> <i>screeved</i> there upon the stones a copy of the law of <i>Maureen</i>, which <i>she</i> <i>screeved</i> in the presence of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel.
  </li>
  <li>And all Israel, and their <i>fungi</i>, and <i>hilda handcuffs</i>, and their <i>beaks</i>, stood on this side the <i>bijou arkette</i> and on that side before the <i>godly homies</i> the Levites, which bare the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the covenant of the <i>Duchess</i>, as well the stranger, as <i>she</i> that was born among them; half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as <i>Maureen</i> the <i>serving homie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> had commanded before, that they should bless the <i>homies and palones</i> of Israel.
  </li>
  <li>And afterward <i>she</i> <i>varda the lavs</i> all the <i>lavs</i> of the law, the <i>bona lavs</i> and cursings, according to all that is <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the law.
  </li>
  <li>There was not a <i>lav</i> of all that <i>Maureen</i> commanded, which Joshua <i>varda the lavs</i> not before all the <i>punters</i> of Israel, with the <i>palones</i>, and the <i>bijou</i> ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.

  <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
  <ol>
  <li><i>Any road up</i>, when all the <i>dowriest homies</i> which were on this side Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the <i>dowry</i> sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, <i>aunt nelled</i> thereof;
  </li>
  <li>That they gathered themselves together, to <i>palaver</i> with Joshua and with Israel, with <i>una</i> accord.
  </li>
  <li>And when the inhabitants of Gibeon <i>aunt nelled</i> what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai,
  </li>
  <li>They did <i>acting dickey</i> wilily, and <i>trolled</i> and made as if they had been ambassadors, and <i>lelled</i> <i>badge</i> sacks upon their asses, and <i>sherry</i> <i>schooners</i>, <i>badge</i>, and rent, and bound up;
  </li>
  <li>And <i>badge</i> <i>slingbacks</i> and clouted upon their <i>plates</i>, and <i>badge</i> <i>frocks</i> upon them; and all the <i>pannan</i> of their provision was dry and mouldy.
  </li>
  <li>And they <i>trolled</i> to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, and to the <i>homies</i> of Israel, We be <i>troll</i> from a far country: now therefore make ye a league with us.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>homies</i> of Israel <i>cackled</i> unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye <i>lett</i> among us; and how shall we make a league with you?
  </li>
  <li>And they <i>cackled</i> unto Joshua, We are thy <i>serving homies</i>. And Joshua <i>cackled</i> unto them, Who are ye? and from whence <i>troll</i> ye?
  </li>
  <li>And they <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, From a <i>dowry</i> far country thy <i>serving homies</i> are <i>troll</i> because of the name of the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i>: for we have <i>aunt nelled</i> the fame of <i>her</i>, and all that <i>she</i> did in Egypt,
  </li>
  <li>And all that <i>she</i> did to the <i>dewey</i> <i>dowriest homies</i> of the Amorites, that were beyond Jordan, to Sihon <i>dowriest homie</i> of Heshbon, and to Og <i>dowriest homie</i> of Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth.
  </li>
  <li>Wherefore our <i>fungi</i> and all the inhabitants of our country <i>cackled</i> to us, <i>cackling</i>, <i>lell</i> victuals with you for the journey, and <i>troll</i> to meet them, and <i>cackle</i> unto them, We are your <i>serving homies</i>: therefore now make ye a league with us.
  </li>
  <li>This our <i>pannan</i> we <i>lelled</i> hot for our provision out of our <i>latties</i> on the <i>journo</i> we <i>trolled</i> forth to <i>troll</i> unto you; but now, <i>varda</i>, it is dry, and it is mouldy:
  </li>
  <li>And these <i>schooners</i> of <i>sherry</i>, which we filled, were new; and, <i>varda</i>, they be rent: and these our <i>frocks</i> and our <i>slingbacks</i> are become <i>badge</i> by reason of the <i>dowry</i> long journey.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>homies</i> <i>lelled</i> of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the <i>screech</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the <i>princesses</i> of the <i>punters</i> sware unto them.
  </li>
  <li><i>Any road up</i> at the end of <i>trey</i> days after they had made a league with them, that they <i>aunt nelled</i> that they were their neighbours, and that they <i>letted</i> among them.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel journeyed, and <i>trolled</i> unto their <i>smokes</i> on the third <i>journo</i>. Now their <i>smokes</i> were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>slapped</i> them not, because the <i>princesses</i> of the <i>punters</i> had sworn unto them by the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel. And all the <i>punters</i> murmured against the <i>princesses</i>.
  </li>
  <li>But all the <i>princesses</i> <i>cackled</i> unto all the <i>punters</i>, We have sworn unto them by the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel: now therefore we may not <i>reef</i> them.
  </li>
  <li>This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>princesses</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of <i>aqua</i> unto all the <i>punters</i>; as the <i>princesses</i> had promised them.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua <i>screeched</i> for them, and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>cackling</i>, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, <i>cackling</i>, We are <i>dowry</i> <i>nishter ajax</i> you; when ye <i>lett</i> among us?
  </li>
  <li>Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of <i>aqua</i> for the <i>lattie</i> of my <i>Gloria</i>.

  <li>And they answered Joshua, and <i>cackled</i>, Because it was <i>mais oui</i> <i>cackled</i> thy <i>serving homies</i>, how that the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> commanded <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i> <i>Maureen</i> to <i>parker</i> you all the land, and to <i>battyfang</i> all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this <i>fakement</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And now, <i>varda</i>, we are in thine <i>famble</i>: as it seemeth <i>bona</i> and <i>sweet</i> unto thee to do unto us, do.
  </li>
  <li>And so did <i>she</i> unto them, and <i>laued</i> them out of the <i>famble</i> of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, that they <i>ferricadoozaed</i> them not.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua made them that <i>journo</i> hewers of wood and drawers of <i>aqua</i> for the <i>punters</i>, and for the <i>grovelling fakement</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, even unto this <i>journo</i>, in the place which <i>she</i> should choose.
  </li>

  <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>Now it <i>trolled</i> to pass, when Adonizedec <i>dowriest homie</i> of Jerusalem had <i>aunt nelled</i> how Joshua had <i>lelled</i> Ai, and had utterly <i>battyfanged</i> it; as <i>she</i> had done to Jericho and her <i>dowriest homie</i>, so <i>she</i> had done to Ai and her <i>dowriest homie</i>; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;
  </li>
  <li>That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a <i>dowry</i> <i>smoke</i>, as <i>una</i> of the royal <i>smokes</i>, and because it was <i>dowrier</i> than Ai, and all the <i>homies</i> thereof were <i>dowry butch</i>.
  </li>
  <li>Wherefore Adonizedec <i>dowriest homie</i> of Jerusalem, <i>laued</i> unto Hoham <i>dowriest homie</i> of Hebron, and unto Piram <i>dowriest homie</i> of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia <i>dowriest homie</i> of Lachish, and unto Debir <i>dowriest homie</i> of Eglon, <i>cackling</i>,
  </li>
  <li><i>Troll</i> up unto me, and help me, that we may <i>slap</i> Gibeon: for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel.
  </li>
  <li>Therefore the <i>chinker</i> <i>dowriest homies</i> of the Amorites, the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Jerusalem, the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Hebron, the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Jarmuth, the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Lachish, the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and <i>trolled</i> up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made <i>barney</i> against it.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>homies</i> of Gibeon <i>laued</i> unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, <i>cackling</i>, Slack not thy <i>famble</i> from thy <i>serving homies</i>; <i>troll</i> up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the <i>dowriest homies</i> of the Amorites that <i>lett</i> in the mountains are gathered together against us.
  </li>
  <li>So Joshua <i>trolled up</i> from Gilgal, <i>she</i>, and all the <i>homies and palones</i> of <i>barney</i> with <i>her</i>, and all the <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i> of valour.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have <i>laued</i> them into thine <i>famble</i>; there shall not a <i>homie</i> of them stand before thee.
  </li>
  <li>Joshua therefore <i>trolled</i> unto them suddenly, and <i>trolled</i> up from Gilgal all <i>nochy</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> discomfited them before Israel, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> them with a <i>dowry</i> slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up to Bethhoron, and <i>slapped</i> them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.
  </li>
  <li><i>Any road up</i>, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going down to Bethhoron, that the <i>Duchess</i> cast down <i>dowry</i> stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they <i>carked it</i>: they were more which <i>carked it</i> with hailstones than they whom the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>ferricadoozaed</i> with the <i>dowry efink</i>.
  </li>
  <li>Then <i>cackled</i> Joshua to the <i>Duchess</i> in the <i>journo</i> when the <i>Duchess</i> <i>laued</i> up the Amorites before the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.
  </li>
  <li>And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the <i>homies and palones</i> had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to <i>troll</i> down about a whole <i>journo</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And there was no <i>journo</i> like that before it or after it, that the <i>Duchess</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> unto the <i>cackling fakement</i> of a <i>homie</i>: for the <i>Duchess</i> <i>palavered</i> for Israel.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua <i>trolled back</i>, and all Israel with <i>her</i>, unto the camp to Gilgal.
  </li>
  <li>But these <i>chinker</i> <i>dowriest homies</i> fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.
  </li>
  <li>And it was <i>cackled</i> Joshua, <i>cackling</i>, The <i>chinker</i> <i>dowriest homies</i> are found hid in a cave at Makkedah.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua <i>cackled</i>, Roll <i>dowry</i> stones upon the <i>screech</i> of the cave, and set <i>homies</i> by it for to keep them:
  </li>
  <li>And stay ye not, but pursue after your enemies, and <i>slap</i> the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their <i>smokes</i>: for the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>laued</i> them into your <i>famble</i>.
  </li>
  <li><i>Any road up</i>, when Joshua and the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry</i> slaughter, till they were consumed, that the <i>lettie</i> which remained of them entered into fenced <i>smokes</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And all the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>trolled back to</i> the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none <i>trolled</i> <i>her</i> <i>polari</i> against any of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel.
  </li>
  <li>Then <i>cackled</i> Joshua, Open the <i>screech</i> of the cave, and <i>parker</i> out those <i>chinker</i> <i>dowriest homies</i> unto me out of the cave.
  </li>
  <li>And they did so, and brought forth those <i>chinker</i> <i>dowriest homies</i> unto <i>her</i> out of the cave, the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Jerusalem, the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Hebron, the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Jarmuth, the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Lachish, and the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Eglon.
  </li>
  <li><i>Any road up</i>, when they brought out those <i>dowriest homies</i> unto Joshua, that Joshua <i>screeched</i> for all the <i>homies</i> of Israel, and <i>cackled</i> unto the captains of the <i>homies</i> of <i>barney</i> which <i>trolled</i> with <i>her</i>, <i>troll</i> near, put your <i>plates</i> upon the necks of these <i>dowriest homies</i>. And they <i>trolled</i> near, and put their <i>plates</i> upon the necks of them.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua <i>cackled</i> unto them, Fear not, <i>nishta</i> be dismayed, be <i>butch</i> and of <i>bona</i> courage: for thus shall the <i>Duchess</i> do to all your enemies against whom ye <i>palaver</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And afterward Joshua <i>slapped</i> them, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> them, and hanged them on <i>chinker</i> trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the <i>bijou nochy</i>.
  </li>
  <li><i>Any road up</i> at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they <i>lelled</i> them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and <i>laued</i> <i>dowry</i> stones in the cave&#8217;s <i>screech</i>, which remain until this <i>dowry</i> <i>journo</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And that <i>journo</i> Joshua <i>lelled</i> Makkedah, and <i>slapped</i> it with the edge of the <i>dowry efink</i>, and the <i>dowriest homie</i> thereof <i>she</i> utterly <i>battyfanged</i>, them, and all the <i>nishta lucoddies</i> that were therein; <i>she</i> let none remain: and <i>she</i> did to the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Makkedah as <i>she</i> did unto the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Jericho.
  </li>
  <li>Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with <i>her</i>, unto Libnah, and <i>palavered</i> against Libnah:
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>laued</i> it also, and the <i>dowriest homie</i> thereof, into the <i>famble</i> of Israel; and <i>she</i> <i>slapped</i> it with the edge of the <i>dowry efink</i>, and all the <i>nishta lucoddies</i> that were therein; <i>she</i> let none remain in it; but did unto the <i>dowriest homie</i> thereof as <i>she</i> did unto the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Jericho.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with <i>her</i>, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and <i>palavered</i> against it:
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>laued</i> Lachish into the <i>famble</i> of Israel, which <i>lelled</i> it on the second <i>journo</i>, and <i>slapped</i> it with the edge of the <i>dowry efink</i>, and all the <i>nishta lucoddies</i> that were therein, according to all that <i>she</i> had done to Libnah.
  </li>
  <li>Then Horam <i>dowriest homie</i> of Gezer <i>trolled</i> up to help Lachish; and Joshua <i>slapped</i> <i>her</i> and <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, until <i>she</i> had <i>dry</i> <i>her</i> none remaining.
  </li>
  <li>And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with <i>her</i>; and they encamped against it, and <i>palavered</i> against it:
  </li>
  <li>And they <i>lelled</i> it on that <i>journo</i>, and <i>slapped</i> it with the edge of the <i>dowry efink</i>, and all the <i>nishta lucoddies</i> that were therein <i>she</i> utterly <i>battyfanged</i> that <i>journo</i>, according to all that <i>she</i> had done to Lachish.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua <i>trolled</i> up from Eglon, and all Israel with <i>her</i>, unto Hebron; and they <i>palavered</i> against it:
  </li>
  <li>And they <i>lelled</i> it, and <i>slapped</i> it with the edge of the <i>dowry efink</i>, and the <i>dowriest homie</i> thereof, and all the <i>smokes</i> thereof, and all the <i>nishta lucoddies</i> that were therein; <i>she</i> <i>dry</i> none remaining, according to all that <i>she</i> had done to Eglon; but <i>battyfanged</i> it utterly, and all the <i>nishta lucoddies</i> that were therein.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua <i>trolled back</i>, and all Israel with <i>her</i>, to Debir; and <i>palavered</i> against it:
  </li>
  <li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> it, and the <i>dowriest homie</i> thereof, and all the <i>smokes</i> thereof; and they <i>slapped</i> them with the edge of the <i>dowry efink</i>, and utterly <i>battyfanged</i> all the <i>nishta lucoddies</i> that were therein; <i>she</i> <i>dry</i> none remaining: as <i>she</i> had done to Hebron, so <i>she</i> did to Debir, and to the <i>dowriest homie</i> thereof; as <i>she</i> had done also to Libnah, and to her <i>dowriest homie</i>.
  </li>
  <li>So Joshua <i>slapped</i> all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their <i>dowriest homies</i>: <i>she</i> <i>dry</i> none remaining, but utterly <i>battyfanged</i> all that breathed, as the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel commanded.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua <i>slapped</i> them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.
  </li>
  <li>And all these <i>dowriest homies</i> and their land did Joshua <i>lell</i> at <i>una</i> time, because the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel <i>palavered</i> for Israel.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua <i>trolled back</i>, and all Israel with <i>her</i>, unto the camp to Gilgal.

  <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
  <ol>
  <li><i>Any road up</i>, when Jabin <i>dowriest homie</i> of Hazor had <i>aunt nelled</i> those <i>fakements</i>, that <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> to Jobab <i>dowriest homie</i> of Madon, and to the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Shimron, and to the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Achshaph,
  </li>
  <li>And to the <i>dowriest homies</i> that were on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west,
  </li>
  <li>And to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.
  </li>
  <li>And they <i>trolled</i> out, they and all their hosts with them, <i>dowry</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude, with horses and <i>rattling coves</i> <i>dowry</i> many.
  </li>
  <li>And when all these <i>dowriest homies</i> were met together, they <i>trolled</i> and pitched together at the <i>aquas</i> of Merom, to <i>palaver</i> against Israel.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all <i>ferricadoozed</i> before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their <i>rattling coves</i> with <i>binco fakement</i>.
  </li>
  <li>So Joshua <i>trolled</i>, and all the <i>homies and palones</i> of <i>barney</i> with <i>her</i>, against them by the <i>aquas</i> of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>laued</i> them into the <i>famble</i> of Israel, who <i>slapped</i> them, and chased them unto <i>dowry</i> Zidon, and unto Misrephothmaim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they <i>slapped</i> them, until they <i>dry</i> them none remaining.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua did unto them as the <i>Duchess</i> bade <i>her</i>: <i>she</i> houghed their horses, and burnt their <i>rattling coves</i> with <i>binco fakement</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua at that time turned back, and <i>lelled</i> Hazor, and <i>slapped</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> thereof with the <i>dowry efink</i>: for Hazor beforetime was the <i>eke</i> of all those kingdoms.
  </li>
  <li>And they <i>slapped</i> all the <i>nishta lucoddies</i> that were therein with the edge of the <i>dowry efink</i>, utterly destroying them: there was not any <i>dry</i> to breathe: and <i>she</i> burnt Hazor with <i>binco fakement</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And all the <i>smokes</i> of those <i>dowriest homies</i>, and all the <i>dowriest homies</i> of them, did Joshua <i>lell</i>, and <i>slapped</i> them with the edge of the <i>dowry efink</i>, and <i>she</i> utterly <i>battyfanged</i> them, as <i>Maureen</i> the <i>serving homie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> commanded.
  </li>
  <li>But as for the <i>smokes</i> that stood still in their <i>butchness</i>, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.
  </li>
  <li>And all the spoil of these <i>smokes</i>, and the cattle, the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>lelled</i> for a prey unto themselves; but every <i>homie</i> they <i>slapped</i> with the edge of the <i>dowry efink</i>, until they had <i>battyfanged</i> them, <i>nishta</i> <i>dry</i> they any to breathe.
  </li>
  <li>As the <i>Duchess</i> commanded <i>Maureen</i> <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i>, so did <i>Maureen</i> command Joshua, and so did Joshua; <i>she</i> <i>dry</i> <i>nishter</i> undone of all that the <i>Duchess</i> commanded <i>Maureen</i>.
  </li>
  <li>So Joshua <i>lelled</i> all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;
  </li>
  <li>Even from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their <i>dowriest homies</i> <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i>, and <i>slapped</i> them, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> them.
  </li>
  <li>Joshua made <i>barney</i> a long time with all those <i>dowriest homies</i>.
  </li>
  <li>There was not a <i>smoke</i> that made peace with the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other they <i>lelled</i> in battle.
  </li>
  <li>For it was of the <i>Duchess</i> to harden their <i>thumping cheats</i>, that they should <i>troll</i> against Israel in battle, that <i>she</i> might <i>battyfang</i> them utterly, and that they might have no favour, but that <i>she</i> might <i>battyfang</i> them, as the <i>Duchess</i> commanded <i>Maureen</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And at that time <i>trolled</i> Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua <i>battyfanged</i> them utterly with their <i>smokes</i>.
  </li>
  <li>There was none of the Anakims <i>dry</i> in the land of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.
  </li>
  <li>So Joshua <i>lelled</i> the whole land, according to all that the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Maureen</i>; and Joshua <i>parkered</i> it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from <i>barney</i>.

  <li>This is the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the <i>naffs</i>, and all Geshuri,

  <li>These are the countries which <i>Maureen</i> did distribute for inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan, by Jericho, eastward.

  <h2>Chapter 14</h2>

  <li>And these are the countries which the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the <i>godly homie</i>, and Joshua the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nun, and the <i>ekes</i> of the <i>aunties</i> of the tribes of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, distributed for inheritance to them.
  </li>
  <li>By lot was their inheritance, as the <i>Duchess</i> commanded by the <i>famble</i> of <i>Maureen</i>, for the <i>sey trey</i> tribes, and for the half tribe.
  </li>
  <li>For <i>Maureen</i> had <i>parkered</i> the inheritance of <i>dewey</i> tribes and an half tribe on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> none inheritance among them.
  </li>
  <li>For the <i>chavvies</i> of <i>Josephine</i> were <i>dewey</i> tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: therefore they <i>parkered</i> no part unto the Levites in the land, save <i>smokes</i> to <i>lett</i> in, with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance.
  </li>
  <li>As the <i>Duchess</i> commanded <i>Maureen</i>, so the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel did, and they <i>medzered</i> the land.
  </li>
  <li>Then the <i>chavvies</i> of Judah <i>trolled</i> unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jephunneh the Kenezite <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Thou knowest the <i>fakement</i> that the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Maureen</i> the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> concerning me and thee in Kadeshbarnea.
  </li>
  <li><i>Quarter dacha</i> years <i>badge</i> was I when <i>Maureen</i> the <i>serving homie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>laued</i> me from Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land; and I brought <i>her</i> <i>lav</i> again as it was in mine <i>thumping cheat</i>.
  </li>
  <li><i>Any road up</i> my <i>sisters</i> that <i>trolled</i> up with me made the <i>thumping cheat</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i> melt: but I wholly <i>trolled after</i> the <i>Duchess</i> my <i>Gloria</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>Maureen</i> sware on that <i>journo</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Surely the land whereon thy <i>plates</i> have <i>minced</i> shall be thine inheritance, and thy <i>chavvies</i>&#8216;s for ever, because thou hast wholly <i>trolled after</i> the <i>Duchess</i> my <i>Gloria</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And now, <i>varda</i>, the <i>Duchess</i> hath kept me alive, as <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, these <i>quarter dacha</i> and <i>chinker</i> years, even since the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> this <i>lav</i> unto <i>Maureen</i>, while the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel wandered in the <i>nishta smoke</i>: and now, lo, I am this <i>journo</i> fourscore and <i>chinker</i> years <i>badge</i>.
  </li>
  <li>As yet I am as <i>butch</i> this <i>journo</i> as I was in the <i>journo</i> that <i>Maureen</i> <i>laued</i> me: as my <i>butchness</i> was then, even so is my <i>butchness</i> now, for <i>barney</i>, both to <i>troll out</i>, and to <i>troll</i> in.
  </li>
  <li>Now therefore <i>parker</i> me this mountain, whereof the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> in that <i>journo</i>; for thou heardest in that <i>journo</i> how the Anakims were there, and that the <i>smokes</i> were <i>dowry</i> and fenced: if so be the <i>Duchess</i> will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua <i>fabed</i> <i>her</i>, and <i>parkered</i> unto Caleb the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance.

  <li>Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this <i>journo</i>, because that <i>she</i> wholly <i>trolled after</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel.
  </li>
  <li>And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba; which Arba was a <i>dowry</i> <i>homie</i> among the Anakims. And the land had <i>lettie</i> from <i>barney</i>.

  <h2>Chapter 15</h2>

  <li>This then was the lot of the tribe of the <i>chavvies</i> of Judah by their families; even to the border of Edom the <i>nishta smoke</i> of Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coast.
  </li>
  <li>And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from the bay that <i>varda-eth</i> southward:

  <li>And the west border was to the <i>dowry</i> sea, and the coast thereof. This is the coast of the <i>chavvies</i> of Judah round about according to their families.

  <li>So the <i>chavvies</i> of <i>Josephine</i>, Manasseh and Ephraim, <i>lelled</i> their inheritance.

  <li>And the border of the <i>chavvies</i> of Ephraim according to their families was thus: even the border of their inheritance on the east side was Atarothaddar, unto Bethhoron the upper;

  <li>And the border <i>trolled</i> out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side; and the border <i>trolled</i> about eastward unto Taanathshiloh, and <i>trolled by</i> it on the east to Janohah;

  <li>And it <i>trolled</i> down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and <i>trolled</i> to Jericho, and <i>trolled</i> out at Jordan.

  <li>The border <i>trolled</i> out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the <i>chavvies</i> of Ephraim by their families.

  <li>And the separate <i>smokes</i> for the <i>chavvies</i> of Ephraim were among the inheritance of the <i>chavvies</i> of Manasseh, all the <i>smokes</i> with their villages.

  <li>And they drave not out the Canaanites that <i>letted</i> in Gezer: but the Canaanites <i>lett</i> among the Ephraimites unto this <i>journo</i>, and serve under tribute.

  <h2>Chapter 17</h2>

  <li>There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for <i>she</i> was the firstborn of <i>Josephine</i>; to wit, for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the <i>Auntie</i> of Gilead: because <i>she</i> was a <i>homie</i> of <i>barney</i>, therefore <i>she</i> had Gilead and Bashan.
  </li>
  <li>There was also a lot for the <i>lettie</i> of the <i>chavvies</i> of Manasseh by their families; for the <i>chavvies</i> of Abiezer, and for the <i>chavvies</i> of Helek, and for the <i>chavvies</i> of Asriel, and for the <i>chavvies</i> of Shechem, and for the <i>chavvies</i> of Hepher, and for the <i>chavvies</i> of Shemida: these were the <i>omee</i> <i>chavvies</i> of Manasseh the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>Josephine</i> by their families.

  <li>But Zelophehad, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Hepher, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Gilead, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Machir, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Manasseh, had no <i>homie chavvies</i>, but <i>palone chavvies</i>: and these are the names of <i>her</i> <i>palone chavvies</i>, Mahlah, and <i>Norah</i>, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
  </li>
  <li>And they <i>trolled</i> near before Eleazar the <i>godly homie</i>, and before Joshua the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nun, and before the <i>princesses</i>, <i>cackling</i>, The <i>Duchess</i> commanded <i>Maureen</i> to <i>parker</i> us an inheritance among our <i>sisters</i>. Therefore according to the <i>butch lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> them an inheritance among the <i>sisters</i> of their <i>Auntie</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And there fell <i>dacha</i> portions to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side Jordan;
  </li>
  <li>Because the <i>palone chavvies</i> of Manasseh had an inheritance among <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>: and the <i>lettie</i> of Manasseh&#8217;s <i>homie chavvies</i> had the land of Gilead.
  </li>
  <li>And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that <i>lettieth</i> before Shechem; and the border <i>trolled</i> along on the <i>sweet martini</i> unto the inhabitants of Entappuah.
  </li>
  <li>Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the <i>chavvies</i> of Ephraim;
  </li>
  <li>And the coast <i>trolled down</i> unto the river Kanah, southward of the river: these <i>smokes</i> of Ephraim are among the <i>smokes</i> of Manasseh: the coast of Manasseh also was on the north side of the river, and the outgoings of it were at the sea:
  </li>
  <li>Southward it was Ephraim&#8217;s, and northward it was Manasseh&#8217;s, and the sea is <i>her</i> border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in Issachar on the east.

  <li>And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, even <i>trey</i> countries.
  </li>
  <li>Yet the <i>chavvies</i> of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those <i>smokes</i>; but the Canaanites would <i>lett</i> in that land.

  <li>Yet it <i>trolled</i> to pass, when the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel were waxen <i>butch</i>, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not utterly drive them out.

  <li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of <i>Josephine</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Joshua, <i>cackling</i>, Why hast thou <i>parkered</i> me but <i>una</i> lot and <i>una</i> portion to inherit, <i>vardaing</i> I am a <i>dowry</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, forasmuch as the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>fabed</i> me hitherto?
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua answered them, If thou be a <i>dowry</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, then get thee up to the wood country, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the <i>big butch homies</i>, if mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of <i>Josephine</i> <i>cackled</i>, The hill is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that <i>lett</i> in the land of the valley have <i>rattling coves</i> of iron, both they who are of Bethshean and her towns, and they who are of the valley of Jezreel.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Josephine</i>, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, <i>cackling</i>, Thou art a <i>dowry</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, and hast <i>dowry</i> power: <i>nishta</i> have <i>una</i> lot only:
  </li>
  <li>But the mountain shall be thine; for it is a wood, and thou shalt cut it down: and the outgoings of it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron <i>rattling coves</i>, and though they be <i>butch</i>.

  <li><i>Parker</i> out from among you <i>trey</i> <i>homies</i> for each tribe: and I will <i>lau</i> them, and they shall rise, and <i>troll</i> through the land, and describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they shall <i>troll</i> again to me.

  <li>Ye shall therefore describe the land into <i>setter</i> parts, and <i>parker</i> the description hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i>.

  <li>And the lot of the tribe of the <i>chavvies</i> of Benjamin <i>trolled</i> up according to their families: and the coast of their lot <i>trolled</i> forth between the <i>chavvies</i> of Judah and the <i>chavvies</i> of <i>Josephine</i>.

  <li>And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the border <i>trolled</i> up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and <i>trolled</i> up through the mountains westward; and the goings out thereof were at the <i>nishta smoke</i> of Bethaven.

  <li>And the border <i>trolled</i> over from thence toward Luz, to the side of Luz, which is Bethel, southward; and the border <i>trolled down</i> to Atarothadar, near the hill that <i>lettieth</i> on the south side of the nether Bethhoron.

  <li>And the border was drawn thence, and compassed the corner of the sea southward, from the hill that <i>lettieth</i> before Bethhoron southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjathbaal, which is Kirjathjearim, a <i>smoke</i> of the <i>chavvies</i> of Judah: this was the west quarter.

  <li>Therefore <i>cackled</i> we, that it shall be, when they should so <i>cackle</i> to us or to our <i>chavvies</i> in time to <i>troll</i>, that we may <i>cackle</i> again, <i>varda</i> the pattern of the <i>grovelling fakement</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, which our <i>aunties</i> made, not for burnt <i>parkerings</i>, <i>nishta</i> for <i>parkers</i>; but it is a <i>varda-ing fakement</i> between us and you.
  </li>
  <li><i>Gloria</i> forbid that we should rebel against the <i>Duchess</i>, and turn this <i>journo</i> from following the <i>Duchess</i>, to build an <i>grovelling fakement</i> for burnt <i>parkerings</i>, for <i>carnish</i> <i>parkerings</i>, or for <i>parkers</i>, beside the <i>grovelling fakement</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i> that is before <i>her</i> <i>bijou tabernaclette</i>.

  <li>And when Phinehas the <i>godly homie</i>, and the <i>princesses</i> of the <i>punters</i> and <i>ekes</i> of the <i>milles</i> of Israel which were with <i>her</i>, <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>lavs</i> that the <i>chavvies</i> of Reuben and the <i>chavvies</i> of Gad and the <i>chavvies</i> of Manasseh <i>cackled</i>, it pleased them.
  </li>
  <li>And Phinehas the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Eleazar the <i>godly homie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>chavvies</i> of Reuben, and to the <i>chavvies</i> of Gad, and to the <i>chavvies</i> of Manasseh, This <i>journo</i> we perceive that the <i>Duchess</i> is among us, because ye have not committed this <i>caterver</i> against the <i>Duchess</i>: now ye have <i>laued</i> the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel out of the <i>famble</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And Phinehas the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Eleazar the <i>godly homie</i>, and the <i>princesses</i>, <i>trolled back</i> from the <i>chavvies</i> of Reuben, and from the <i>chavvies</i> of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, and brought them <i>lav</i> again.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>fakement</i> pleased the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel; and the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>fabed</i> <i>Gloria</i>, and did not intend to <i>troll</i> up against them in battle, to <i>battyfang</i> the land wherein the <i>chavvies</i> of Reuben and Gad <i>letted</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Reuben and the <i>chavvies</i> of Gad <i>screeched</i> the <i>grovelling fakement</i> Ed: for it shall be a <i>varda-ing fakement</i> between us that the <i>Duchess</i> is <i>Gloria</i>.

  <li><i>Any road up</i> a long time after that the <i>Duchess</i> had <i>parkered</i> <i>lettie</i> unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua waxed <i>badge</i> and stricken in age.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua <i>screeched</i> for all Israel, and for their <i>fungi</i>, and for their <i>ekes</i>, and for their <i>beaks</i>, and for their <i>hilda handcuffs</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto them, I am <i>badge</i> and stricken in age:
  </li>
  <li>And ye have <i>vardad</i> all that the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i> hath done unto all these nations because of you; for the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i> is <i>she</i> that hath <i>palavered</i> for you.
  </li>
  <li><i>Varda</i>, I have <i>medzered</i> unto you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the <i>dowry</i> sea westward.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i>, <i>she</i> shall expel them from before you, and drive them from out of your <i>vardaing</i>; and ye shall possess their land, as the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i> hath promised unto you.
  </li>
  <li>Be ye therefore <i>dowry</i> courageous to keep and to do all that is <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the law of <i>Maureen</i>, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the <i>sweet martini</i> or to the <i>dry</i>;
  </li>
  <li>That ye <i>troll</i> not among these nations, these that remain among you; <i>nishta</i> make mention of the name of their gods, <i>nishta</i> cause to swear by them, <i>nishta</i> serve them, <i>nishta</i> bow yourselves unto them:
  </li>
  <li>But cleave unto the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i>, as ye have done unto this <i>journo</i>.
  </li>
  <li>For the <i>Duchess</i> hath driven out from before you <i>dowry</i> nations and <i>butch</i>: but as for you, no <i>homie</i> hath been able to stand before you unto this <i>journo</i>.
  </li>
  <li><i>Una</i> <i>homie</i> of you shall chase a <i>mille</i>: for the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i>, <i>she</i> it is that fighteth for you, as <i>she</i> hath promised you.
  </li>
  <li><i>Lell</i> <i>bona</i> heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i>.
  </li>
  <li>Else if ye do in any wise <i>troll</i> back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and <i>troll</i> in unto them, and they to you:
  </li>
  <li>Know for a certainty that the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i> will <i>nishta</i> drive out any of these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your <i>ogles</i>, until ye perish from off this <i>bona</i> land which the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>parkered</i> you.
  </li>
  <li>And, <i>varda</i>, this <i>journo</i> I am going the way of all the earth: and ye know in all your <i>thumping cheats</i> and in all your <i>nishta lucoddies</i>, that not <i>una</i> <i>fakement</i> hath failed of all the <i>bona</i> <i>fakements</i> which the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i> concerning you; all are <i>troll</i> to pass unto you, and not <i>una</i> <i>fakement</i> hath failed thereof.
  </li>
  <li>Therefore it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, that as all <i>bona</i> <i>fakements</i> are <i>troll</i> upon you, which the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i> promised you; so shall the <i>Duchess</i> <i>parker</i> upon you all <i>nana</i> <i>fakements</i>, until <i>she</i> have <i>battyfanged</i> you from off this <i>bona</i> land which the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>parkered</i> you.
  </li>
  <li>When ye have transgressed the covenant of the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i>, which <i>she</i> commanded you, and have <i>trolled</i> and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the <i>wild</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the <i>bona</i> land which <i>she</i> hath <i>parkered</i> unto you.

  <h2>Chapter 24</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and <i>screeched</i> for the <i>fungi</i> of Israel, and for their <i>ekes</i>, and for their <i>beaks</i>, and for their <i>hilda handcuffs</i>; and they presented themselves before <i>Gloria</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua <i>cackled</i> unto all the <i>homies and palones</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, Your <i>aunties</i> <i>letted</i> on the other side of the <i>dowry aqua</i> in <i>badge</i> time, even Terah, the <i>Auntie</i> of Abraham, and the <i>Auntie</i> of Nachor: and they served other gods.
  </li>
  <li>And I <i>lelled</i> your <i>Auntie</i> Abraham from the other side of the <i>dowry aqua</i>, and led <i>her</i> throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied <i>her</i> <i>maria</i>, and <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> Isaac.
  </li>
  <li>And I <i>parkered</i> unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I <i>parkered</i> unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and <i>her</i> <i>chavvies</i> <i>trolled</i> down into Egypt.
  </li>
  <li>I <i>laued</i> <i>Maureen</i> also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.
  </li>
  <li>And I brought your <i>aunties</i> out of Egypt: and ye <i>trolled</i> unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your <i>aunties</i> with <i>rattling coves</i> and horsemen unto the Red sea.
  </li>
  <li>And when they <i>screeched</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>she</i> put <i>munge</i> between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your <i>ogles</i> have <i>vardad</i> what I have done in Egypt: and ye <i>letted</i> in the <i>nishta smoke</i> a long season.
  </li>
  <li>And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which <i>letted</i> on the other side Jordan; and they <i>palavered</i> with you: and I <i>parkered</i> them into your <i>famble</i>, that ye might possess their land; and I <i>battyfanged</i> them from before you.
  </li>
  <li>Then Balak the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Zippor, <i>dowriest homie</i> of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and <i>laued</i> and <i>screeched</i> Balaam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Beor to curse you:
  </li>
  <li>But I would not <i>aunt nell</i> unto Balaam; therefore <i>she</i> <i>fabed</i> you still: so I <i>laued</i> you out of <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And you <i>trolled</i> over Jordan, and <i>trolled</i> unto Jericho: and the <i>homies</i> of Jericho <i>palavered</i> against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I <i>laued</i> them into your <i>famble</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And I <i>laued</i> the hornet before you, which drave them out from before you, even the <i>dewey</i> <i>dowriest homies</i> of the Amorites; but not with thy <i>dowry efink</i>, <i>nishta</i> with thy bow.
  </li>
  <li>And I have <i>parkered</i> you a land for which ye did not <i>acting dickey</i>, and <i>smokes</i> which ye built not, and ye <i>lett</i> in them; of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye <i>jarry</i>.
  </li>
  <li>Now therefore fear the <i>Duchess</i>, and serve <i>her</i> in sincerity and <i>no flies</i>: and put away the gods which your <i>aunties</i> served on the other side of the <i>dowry aqua</i>, and in Egypt; and serve ye the <i>Duchess</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And if it seem <i>nana</i> unto you to serve the <i>Duchess</i>, choose you this <i>journo</i> whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your <i>aunties</i> served that were on the other side of the <i>dowry aqua</i>, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye <i>lett</i>: but as for me and my <i>lattie</i>, we will serve the <i>Duchess</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>homies and palones</i> answered and <i>cackled</i>, <i>Gloria</i> forbid that we should forsake the <i>Duchess</i>, to serve other gods;
  </li>
  <li>For the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i>, <i>she</i> it is that brought us up and our <i>aunties</i> out of the land of Egypt, from the <i>lattie</i> of bondage, and which did those <i>dowry</i> signs in our <i>vardaing</i>, and preserved us in all the way wherein we <i>trolled</i>, and among all the <i>homies and palones</i> through whom we passed:
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> drave out from before us all the <i>homies and palones</i>, even the Amorites which <i>letted</i> in the land: therefore will we also serve the <i>Duchess</i>; for <i>she</i> is our <i>Gloria</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>homies and palones</i>, Ye cannot serve the <i>Duchess</i>: for <i>she</i> is an <i>fabulosa</i> <i>Gloria</i>; <i>she</i> is a jealous <i>Gloria</i>; <i>she</i> will not forgive your transgressions <i>nishta</i> your <i>kertervers</i>.
  </li>
  <li>If ye forsake the <i>Duchess</i>, and serve strange gods, then <i>she</i> will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that <i>she</i> hath done you <i>bona</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the <i>Duchess</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>homies and palones</i>, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the <i>Duchess</i>, to serve <i>her</i>. And they <i>cackled</i>, We are witnesses.
  </li>
  <li>Now therefore put away, <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i>, the strange gods which are among you, and incline your <i>thumping cheat</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Joshua, The <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i> will we serve, and <i>her</i> <i>cackling fakement</i> will we obey.
  </li>
  <li>So Joshua made a covenant with the <i>homies and palones</i> that <i>journo</i>, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua <i>screeved</i> these <i>lavs</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the law of <i>Gloria</i>, and <i>lelled</i> a <i>dowry</i> stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the <i>Duchess</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And Joshua <i>cackled</i> unto all the <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>varda</i>, this stone shall be a <i>varda-ing fakement</i> unto us; for it hath <i>aunt nelled</i> all the <i>lavs</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> which <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto us: it shall be therefore a <i>varda-ing fakement</i> unto you, lest ye deny your <i>Gloria</i>.
  </li>
  <li>So Joshua let the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>troll off</i>, every <i>homie</i> unto <i>her</i> inheritance.
  </li>
  <li><i>Any road up</i> after these <i>fakements</i>, that Joshua the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nun, the <i>serving homie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>carked it</i>, being an <i>chenter</i> and <i>dacha</i> years <i>badge</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And they buried <i>her</i> in the border of <i>her</i> inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash.
  </li>
  <li>And Israel served the <i>Duchess</i> all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the <i>fungi</i> that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the works of the <i>Duchess</i>, that <i>she</i> had done for Israel.
  </li>
  <li>And the bones of <i>Josephine</i>, which the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Hamor the <i>Auntie</i> of Shechem for an <i>chenter</i> pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the <i>chavvies</i> of <i>Josephine</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And Eleazar the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Aaron <i>carked it</i>; and they buried <i>her</i> in a hill that pertained to Phinehas <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>, which was <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> in mount Ephraim.
