The Polari Bible is a translation of the King James Bible (otherwise known as the Authorised Version) into Polari, which was a language of sorts used predominantly by gay men in the United Kindgom in the early to mid twentieth-century. It was prepared by the [Manchester House of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence](https://www.themanchestersisters.org/). This is the most recent edition (the seventh, produced in 2014) with slight revisions. It is accompanied by an introduction and a lexicon of Polari words and phrases used in the translation.
