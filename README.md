The Polari Bible is a translation of the Jewish and Christian scriptures into Polari, a language of sorts used predominantly by gay men in the United Kindgom in the early to mid twentieth-century. It is based on the Authorised Version of the Bible (otherwise known as the King James Bible) and was prepared by the [Manchester House of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence](https://www.themanchestersisters.org/). This is the most recent edition - the seventh - with slight revisions. It is accompanied by an introduction and a lexicon of Polari words and phrases used in the translation.
