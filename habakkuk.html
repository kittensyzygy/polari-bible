    <h1>Habakkuk</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did <i>varda</i>.
    </li>
    <li>O <i>Duchess</i>, how long shall I <i>screech</i>, and thou wilt not <i>aunt nell</i>! even <i>screech</i> out unto thee of <i>slapping</i>, and thou wilt not save!
    </li>
    <li>Why dost thou shew me <i>codness</i>, and cause me to <i>varda</i> grievance? for spoiling and <i>slapping</i> are before me: and there are that raise up strife and contention.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never <i>troll forth</i>: for the <i>naff</i> doth compass about the <i>bona</i>; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i> ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvelously: for I will <i>acting dickey</i> a <i>acting dickey</i> in your days which ye will not believe, though it be <i>cackled</i> you.
    </li>
    <li>For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall <i>mince butchly</i> through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces that are not their&#8217;s.
    </li>
    <li>They are <i>nanna</i> and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.
    </li>
    <li>Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the <i>bijou nochy</i> wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall <i>troll</i> from far; they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to <i>jarry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>They shall <i>troll</i> all for <i>slapping</i>: their <i>ekes</i> shall <i>bevvy</i> up as the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.
    </li>
    <li>And they shall scoff at the <i>dowriest homies</i>, and the <i>princesses</i> shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every <i>butch</i> hold; for they shall heap dust, and <i>lell</i> it.
    </li>
    <li>Then shall <i>her</i> mind change, and <i>she</i> shall <i>troll over</i>, and offend, imputing this <i>her</i> power unto <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Art thou not from everlasting, O <i>Duchess</i> my <i>Gloria</i>, mine <i>fabulosa</i> <i>una</i>? we shall not <i>cark it</i>. O <i>Duchess</i>, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O <i>dowry butch</i> <i>Gloria</i>, thou hast established them for correction.
    </li>
    <li>Thou art of purer <i>ogles</i> than to <i>varda</i> <i>nana</i>, and canst not <i>varda</i> on <i>codness</i>: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy <i>polari</i> when the <i>naff</i> devoureth the <i>homie</i> that is more <i>bona</i> than <i>she</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And makest <i>homies</i> as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping <i>fakements</i>, that have no ruler over them?
    </li>
    <li>They <i>lell</i> up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore they <i>parker</i> unto their net, and burn <i>smelly</i> unto their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their <i>carnish</i> plenteous.
    </li>
    <li>Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to <i>ferricadooza</i> the nations?
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>I will stand upon my <i>varda</i>, and set me upon the tower, and will <i>varda</i> to <i>varda</i> what <i>she</i> will <i>cackle</i> unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> answered me, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>screeve</i> the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that <i>she</i> may run that <i>vardaeth the lavs</i> it.
    </li>
    <li>For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall <i>cackle</i>, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely <i>troll</i>, it will not tarry.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, <i>her</i> <i>nishta lucoddy</i> which is lifted up is not upright in <i>her</i>: but the just shall live by <i>her</i> faith.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> also, because <i>she</i> transgresseth by <i>sherry</i>, <i>she</i> is a proud <i>homie</i>, <i>nishta</i> keepeth at home, who enlargeth <i>her</i> <i>fancy</i> as hell, and is as <i>carking it</i>, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto <i>her</i> all nations, and heapeth unto <i>her</i> all <i>homies and palones</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Shall not all these <i>lell</i> up a parable against <i>her</i>, and a taunting proverb against <i>her</i>, and <i>cackle</i>, Woe to <i>her</i> that increaseth that which is not <i>her</i>! how long? and to <i>her</i> that ladeth himself with thick clay!
    </li>
    <li>Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them?
    </li>
    <li>Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the <i>homies and palones</i> shall spoil thee; because of <i>homies</i>&#8216;s blood, and for the <i>slapping</i> of the land, of the <i>smoke</i>, and of all that <i>lett</i> therein.
    </li>
    <li>Woe to <i>her</i> that <i>ogleth</i> an <i>nana</i> <i>ogling</i> to <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>, that <i>she</i> may set <i>her</i> nest on high, that <i>she</i> may be <i>laued</i> from the power of <i>nana</i>!
    </li>
    <li>Thou hast consulted <i>scharda</i> to thy <i>lattie</i> by cutting off many <i>homies and palones</i>, and hast <i>kertervered</i> against thy <i>nishta lucoddy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For the stone shall <i>screech</i> out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.
    </li>
    <li>Woe to <i>her</i> that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a <i>smoke</i> by <i>codness</i>!
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, is it not of the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts that the <i>homies and palones</i> shall <i>acting dickey</i> in the <i>dowry</i> <i>binco fakement</i>, and the <i>homies and palones</i> shall <i>a stretcher case</i> themselves for <i>dowry</i> <i>spangly</i>?
    </li>
    <li>For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the <i>fabeness</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, as the <i>aquas</i> cover the sea.
    </li>
    <li>Woe unto <i>her</i> that giveth <i>her</i> <i>homie ajax</i> <i>buvare</i>, that puttest thy <i>schooner</i> to <i>her</i>, and makest <i>her</i> <i>daffy</i> also, that thou mayest <i>varda</i> on their <i>nanti zhoosh</i>!
    </li>
    <li>Thou art filled with <i>scharda</i> for <i>fabeness</i>: <i>buvare</i> thou also, and let thy <i>chaud&#8217;s mudge</i> be uncovered: the cup of the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s <i>sweet martini</i> shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing shall be on thy <i>fabeness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>slapping</i> of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of beasts, which made them afraid, because of <i>homies</i>&#8216;s blood, and for the <i>slapping</i> of the land, of the <i>smoke</i>, and of all that <i>lett</i> therein.
    </li>
    <li>What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of <i>her</i> <i>acting dickey</i> trusteth therein, to make <i>nanti polari</i> idols?
    </li>
    <li>Woe unto <i>her</i> that <i>cackleth</i> to the wood, Awake; to the <i>nanti polari</i> stone, Arise, it shall teach! <i>varda</i>, it is <i>laued</i> over with <i>gelt</i> and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>Duchess</i> is in <i>her</i> <i>fabulosa</i> <i>holy carsey</i>: let all the earth keep <i>nishta cackle</i> before <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>A <i>meshigener muttering</i> of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.
    </li>
    <li>O <i>Duchess</i>, I have <i>aunt nelled</i> thy <i>cackle</i>, and was afraid: O <i>Duchess</i>, revive thy <i>acting dickey</i> in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.
    </li>
    <li><i>Gloria</i> <i>trolled</i> from Teman, and the <i>fabulosa</i> <i>una</i> from mount Paran. Selah. <i>Her</i> <i>fabeness</i> covered the heavens, and the earth was full of <i>her</i> praise.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>her</i> brightness was as the <i>sparkle</i>; <i>she</i> had <i>colins</i> <i>trolling</i> out of <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>: and there was the hiding of <i>her</i> power.
    </li>
    <li>Before <i>her</i> <i>trolled</i> the <i>bad style</i>, and burning coals <i>trolled</i> forth at <i>her</i> <i>plates</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> stood, and measured the earth: <i>she</i> beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: <i>her</i> ways are everlasting.
    </li>
    <li>I <i>vardad</i> the <i>trolling letties</i> of Cushan in affliction: and the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.
    </li>
    <li>Was the <i>Duchess</i> displeased against the rivers? was thine <i>wild</i> against the rivers? was thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses and thy <i>rattling coves</i> of salvation?
    </li>
    <li>Thy bow was made quite <i>nanti zhoosh</i>, according to the oaths of the tribes, even thy <i>lav</i>. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.
    </li>
    <li>The mountains <i>vardad</i> thee, and they trembled: the overflowing of the <i>aqua</i> <i>trolled by</i>: the deep uttered <i>her</i> <i>cackling fakement</i>, and lifted up <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i> on high.
    </li>
    <li>The sun and moon stood still in their habitation: at the <i>sparkle</i> of thine arrows they <i>trolled</i>, and at the shining of thy glittering spear.
    </li>
    <li>Thou didst <i>mince butchly</i> through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen in <i>wild</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy <i>homies and palones</i>, even for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the <i>eke</i> out of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>naff</i>, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.
    </li>
    <li>Thou didst strike through with <i>her</i> staves the <i>eke</i> of <i>her</i> villages: they <i>trolled</i> out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing was as to devour the <i>nanti dinarly</i> secretly.
    </li>
    <li>Thou didst <i>mince</i> through the sea with thine horses, through the heap of <i>dowry</i> <i>aquas</i>.
    </li>
    <li>When I <i>aunt nelled</i>, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the <i>cackling fakement</i>: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might <i>lettie</i> in the <i>journo</i> of trouble: when <i>she</i> <i>trolleth</i> up unto the <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>she</i> will invade them with <i>her</i> troops.
    </li>
    <li>Although the fig tree shall not blossom, <i>nishta</i> shall fruit be in the vines; the <i>acting dickey</i> of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no <i>carnish</i>; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls:
    </li>
    <li>Yet I will rejoice in the <i>Duchess</i>, I will joy in the <i>Gloria</i> of my salvation.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> is my <i>butchness</i>, and <i>she</i> will make my <i>plates</i> like hinds&#8217; <i>plates</i>, and <i>she</i> will make me to <i>mince</i> upon mine high places. To the <i>dowriest</i> singer on my stringed instruments.
