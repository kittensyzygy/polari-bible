    <h1>Ephesians</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Pauline</i>, an apostle of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> by the will of <i>Gloria</i>, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the <i>fabulous</i> in <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i>:
    </li>
    <li><i>Gracie</i> be to you, and peace, from <i>Gloria</i> our <i>Auntie</i>, and from the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Fabed</i> be the <i>Gloria</i> and <i>Auntie</i> of our <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, who hath <i>fabed</i> us with all spiritual <i>bona lavs</i> in heavenly places in <i>Crystal</i>:
    </li>
    <li>According as <i>she</i> hath chosen us in <i>her</i> before the foundation of the world, that we should be <i>fabulosa</i> and <i>nanti</i> blame before <i>her</i> in love:
    </li>
    <li>Having predestinated us unto the adoption of <i>chavvies</i> by <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> to himself, according to the <i>bona</i> pleasure of <i>her</i> will,
    </li>
    <li>To the praise of the <i>fabeness</i> of <i>her</i> <i>gracie</i>, wherein <i>she</i> hath made us accepted in the beloved.
    </li>
    <li>In whom we have redemption through <i>her</i> blood, the forgiveness of <i>kertervers</i>, according to the riches of <i>her</i> <i>gracie</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Wherein <i>she</i> hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;
    </li>
    <li>Having made known unto us the mystery of <i>her</i> will, according to <i>her</i> <i>bona</i> pleasure which <i>she</i> hath purposed in himself:
    </li>
    <li>That in the dispensation of the fulness of times <i>she</i> might gather together in <i>una</i> all <i>fakements</i> in <i>Crystal</i>, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in <i>her</i>:
    </li>
    <li>In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of <i>her</i> who worketh all <i>fakements</i> after the counsel of <i>her</i> own will:
    </li>
    <li>That we should be to the praise of <i>her</i> <i>fabeness</i>, who first trusted in <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>In whom ye also trusted, after that ye <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>lav</i> of truth, the <i>gossip</i> of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that <i>fabulosa</i> <i>Fairy</i> of promise,
    </li>
    <li>Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased <i>fakement</i>, unto the praise of <i>her</i> <i>fabeness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore I also, after I <i>aunt nelled</i> of your faith in the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i>, and love unto all the saints,
    </li>
    <li>Cease not to <i>parker</i> thanks for you, <i>dishing the dirt on</i> you in my <i>meshigener mutterings</i>;
    </li>
    <li>That the <i>Gloria</i> of our <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, the <i>Auntie</i> of <i>fabeness</i>, may <i>parker</i> unto you the <i>Fairy</i> of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of <i>her</i>:
    </li>
    <li>The <i>ogles</i> of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of <i>her</i> calling, and what the riches of the <i>fabeness</i> of <i>her</i> inheritance in the saints,
    </li>
    <li>And what is the exceeding <i>dowriness</i> of <i>her</i> power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of <i>her</i> <i>dowry butch</i> power,
    </li>
    <li>Which <i>she</i> wrought in <i>Crystal</i>, when <i>she</i> raised <i>her</i> from the <i>stiff</i>, and set <i>her</i> at <i>her</i> own <i>sweet martini</i> in the heavenly places,
    </li>
    <li>Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to <i>troll</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And hath put all <i>fakements</i> under <i>her</i> <i>plates</i>, and <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> to be the <i>eke</i> over all <i>fakements</i> to the <i>meshigener carsey</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Which is <i>her</i> <i>lucoddy</i>, the fulness of <i>her</i> that filleth all in all.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And you hath <i>she</i> quickened, who were <i>stiff</i> in <i>catervers</i> and <i>kertervers</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Wherein in time past ye <i>minced</i> according to the course of this world, according to the <i>princess</i> of the power of the air, the <i>Fairy</i> that now worketh in the <i>chavvies</i> of disobedience:
    </li>
    <li>Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the <i>chavvies</i> of wrath, even as others.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>Gloria</i>, who is rich in mercy, for <i>her</i> <i>dowry</i> love wherewith <i>she</i> loved us,
    </li>
    <li>Even when we were <i>stiff</i> in <i>kertervers</i>, hath quickened us together with <i>Crystal</i>, (by <i>gracie</i> ye are saved;)
    </li>
    <li>And hath raised us up together, and made us <i>lett</i> together in heavenly places in <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>That in the ages to <i>troll</i> <i>she</i> might shew the exceeding riches of <i>her</i> <i>gracie</i> in <i>her</i> kindness toward us through <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For by <i>gracie</i> are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of <i>Gloria</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Not of works, lest any <i>homie</i> should boast.
    </li>
    <li>For we are <i>her</i> workmanship, created in <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i> unto <i>bona</i> works, which <i>Gloria</i> hath before ordained that we should <i>mince</i> in them.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past <i>nishta kosher homies</i> in the flesh, who are <i>screeched</i> Uncircumcision by that which is <i>screeched</i> the Circumcision in the flesh made by <i>fambles</i>;
    </li>
    <li>That at that time ye were <i>nanti</i> <i>Crystal</i>, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and <i>nanti</i> <i>Gloria</i> in the world:
    </li>
    <li>But now in <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i> ye who sometimes were far off are made <i>ajax</i> by the blood of <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> is our peace, who hath made both <i>una</i>, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us;
    </li>
    <li>Having abolished in <i>her</i> flesh the enmity, even the law of <i>butch lavs</i> contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain <i>una</i> new <i>homie</i>, so making peace;
    </li>
    <li>And that <i>she</i> might reconcile both unto <i>Gloria</i> in <i>una</i> <i>lucoddy</i> by the cross, having <i>ferricadoozed</i> the enmity thereby:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>trolled</i> and <i>cackled</i> peace to you which were <i>nishta ajax</i> off, and to them that were <i>ajax</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For through <i>her</i> we both have access by <i>una</i> <i>Fairy</i> unto the <i>Auntie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now therefore ye are <i>nishta</i> strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of <i>Gloria</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> himself being the <i>dowriest</i> corner stone;
    </li>
    <li>In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an <i>fabulosa</i> <i>holy carsey</i> in the <i>Duchess</i>:
    </li>
    <li>In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of <i>Gloria</i> through the <i>Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>For this cause I <i>Pauline</i>, the prisoner of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> for you <i>nishta kosher homies</i>,
    </li>
    <li>If ye have <i>aunt nelled</i> of the dispensation of the <i>gracie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> which is <i>parkered</i> me to you-ward:
    </li>
    <li>How that by revelation <i>she</i> made known unto me the mystery; (as I <i>screeved</i> afore in <i>nishta dowry</i> <i>lavs</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Whereby, when ye <i>varda the lavs</i>, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of <i>Crystal</i>)
    </li>
    <li>Which in other ages was not made known unto the <i>homie chavvies</i> of <i>homies</i>, as it is now revealed unto <i>her</i> <i>fabulosa</i> apostles and prophets by the <i>Fairy</i>;
    </li>
    <li>That the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> should be fellowheirs, and of the same <i>lucoddy</i>, and partakers of <i>her</i> promise in <i>Crystal</i> by the <i>gossip</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the <i>gracie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>parkered</i> unto me by the effectual working of <i>her</i> power.
    </li>
    <li>Unto me, who am <i>nanti dowry</i> than the <i>nanti dowriest</i> of all saints, is this <i>gracie</i> <i>parkered</i>, that I should <i>cackle</i> among the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> the unsearchable riches of <i>Crystal</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And to make all <i>homies</i> <i>varda</i> what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in <i>Gloria</i>, who created all <i>fakements</i> by <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>:
    </li>
    <li>To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the <i>meshigener carsey</i> the manifold wisdom of <i>Gloria</i>,
    </li>
    <li>According to the eternal purpose which <i>she</i> purposed in <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i> our <i>Duchess</i>:
    </li>
    <li>In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore I <i>fancy</i> that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your <i>fabeness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For this cause I bow my knees unto the <i>Auntie</i> of our <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,
    </li>
    <li>That <i>she</i> would grant you, according to the riches of <i>her</i> <i>fabeness</i>, to be strengthened with might by <i>her</i> <i>Fairy</i> in the inner <i>homie</i>;
    </li>
    <li>That <i>Crystal</i> may <i>lett</i> in your <i>thumping cheats</i> by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,
    </li>
    <li>May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;
    </li>
    <li>And to know the love of <i>Crystal</i>, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now unto <i>her</i> that is able to do exceeding <i>dowrily</i> above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,
    </li>
    <li>Unto <i>her</i> be <i>fabeness</i> in the <i>meshigener carsey</i> by <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i> throughout all ages, world <i>nanti</i> end. <i>Larlou</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>I therefore, the prisoner of the <i>Duchess</i>, beseech you that ye <i>mince</i> <i>bona</i> of the vocation wherewith ye are <i>screeched</i>,
    </li>
    <li>With all lowliness and <i>campness</i>, with longsuffering, forbearing <i>una</i> another in love;
    </li>
    <li>Endeavouring to keep the unity of the <i>Fairy</i> in the bond of peace.
    </li>
    <li>There is <i>una</i> <i>lucoddy</i>, and <i>una</i> <i>Fairy</i>, even as ye are <i>screeched</i> in <i>una</i> hope of your calling;
    </li>
    <li><i>Una</i> <i>Duchess</i>, <i>una</i> faith, <i>una</i> baptism,
    </li>
    <li><i>Una</i> <i>Gloria</i> and <i>Auntie</i> of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.
    </li>
    <li>But unto every <i>una</i> of us is <i>parkered</i> <i>gracie</i> according to the measure of the gift of <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i>, When <i>she</i> <i>trolled up</i> up on high, <i>she</i> led captivity captive, and <i>parkered</i> gifts unto <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>(Now that <i>she</i> <i>trolled up</i>, what is it but that <i>she</i> also <i>trolled down</i> first into the lower parts of the earth?
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> that <i>trolled down</i> is the same also that <i>trolled up</i> up far above all heavens, that <i>she</i> might fill all <i>fakements</i>. )
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;
    </li>
    <li>For the perfecting of the saints, for the <i>acting dickey</i> of the ministry, for the edifying of the <i>lucoddy</i> of <i>Crystal</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Till we all <i>troll</i> in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, unto a <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i> <i>homie</i>, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of <i>Crystal</i>:
    </li>
    <li>That we henceforth be <i>nishta</i> <i>chavvies</i>, tossed to and fro, and <i>lelled</i> about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of <i>homies</i>, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to <i>mogue</i>;
    </li>
    <li>But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into <i>her</i> in all <i>fakements</i>, which is the <i>eke</i>, even <i>Crystal</i>:
    </li>
    <li>From whom the whole <i>lucoddy</i> fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the <i>lucoddy</i> unto the edifying of itself in love.
    </li>
    <li>This I <i>cackle</i> therefore, and testify in the <i>Duchess</i>, that ye henceforth <i>mince</i> not as other <i>nishta kosher homies</i> <i>mince</i>, in the <i>spangly</i> of their mind,
    </li>
    <li>Having the understanding <i>munged</i>, being alienated from the life of <i>Gloria</i> through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their <i>thumping cheat</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Who being past feeling have <i>parkered</i> themselves over unto lasciviousness, to <i>acting dickey</i> all <i>nishta sparkle</i> with greediness.
    </li>
    <li>But ye have not so learned <i>Crystal</i>;
    </li>
    <li>If so be that ye have <i>aunt nelled</i> <i>her</i>, and have been taught by <i>her</i>, as the truth is in <i>Josie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>That ye put off concerning the former conversation the <i>badge cove</i>, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;
    </li>
    <li>And be renewed in the <i>Fairy</i> of your mind;
    </li>
    <li>And that ye put on the new <i>homie</i>, which after <i>Gloria</i> is created in <i>bonaness</i> and true holiness.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore putting away lying, <i>cackle</i> every <i>homie</i> truth with <i>her</i> <i>homie ajax</i>: for we are members <i>una</i> of another.
    </li>
    <li>Be ye angry, and <i>kertever</i> not: let not the sun <i>troll</i> down upon your wrath:
    </li>
    <li><i>Nishta</i> <i>parker</i> place to the devil.
    </li>
    <li>Let <i>her</i> that <i>sharpered</i> <i>sharper</i> <i>nishta</i>: but rather let <i>her</i> <i>acting dickey</i>, working with <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i> the <i>fakement</i> which is <i>bona</i>, that <i>she</i> may have to <i>parker</i> to <i>her</i> that needeth.
    </li>
    <li>Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your <i>screech</i>, but that which is <i>bona</i> to the use of edifying, that it may minister <i>gracie</i> unto the hearers.
    </li>
    <li>And grieve not the <i>fabulosa</i> <i>Fairy</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, whereby ye are sealed unto the <i>journo</i> of redemption.
    </li>
    <li>Let all bitterness, and wrath, and <i>wild</i>, and clamour, and <i>nana</i> speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:
    </li>
    <li>And be ye kind <i>una</i> to another, tenderhearted, forgiving <i>una</i> another, even as <i>Gloria</i> for <i>Crystal</i>&#8216;s sake hath forgiven you.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Be ye therefore followers of <i>Gloria</i>, as dear <i>chavvies</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And <i>mince</i> in love, as <i>Crystal</i> also hath loved us, and hath <i>parkered</i> himself for us an <i>parkering</i> and a <i>parker</i> to <i>Gloria</i> for a sweetsmelling savour.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>charvering</i>, and all <i>nishta sparkle</i>, or <i>ogling</i>, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;
    </li>
    <li><i>Nishta</i> filthiness, <i>nishta</i> <i>dizzy</i> talking, <i>nishta</i> jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.
    </li>
    <li>For this ye know, that no whoremonger, <i>nishta</i> <i>nanti sparkle</i> person, <i>nishta</i> covetous <i>homie</i>, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of <i>Crystal</i> and of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Let no <i>homie</i> <i>mogue</i> you with vain <i>lavs</i>: for because of these <i>fakements</i> <i>trolleth</i> the wrath of <i>Gloria</i> upon the <i>chavvies</i> of disobedience.
    </li>
    <li>Be not ye therefore partakers with them.
    </li>
    <li>For ye were sometimes <i>munge</i>, but now are ye <i>sparkle</i> in the <i>Duchess</i>: <i>mince</i> as <i>chavvies</i> of <i>sparkle</i>:
    </li>
    <li>(For the fruit of the <i>Fairy</i> is in all goodness and <i>bonaness</i> and truth;)
    </li>
    <li>Proving what is acceptable unto the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of <i>munge</i>, but rather reprove them.
    </li>
    <li>For it is a <i>scharda</i> even to <i>cackle</i> of those <i>fakements</i> which are done of them in secret.
    </li>
    <li>But all <i>fakements</i> that are reproved are made manifest by the <i>sparkle</i>: for whatsoever doth make manifest is <i>sparkle</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i>, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the <i>stiff</i>, and <i>Crystal</i> shall <i>parker</i> thee <i>sparkle</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i> then that ye <i>mince</i> circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,
    </li>
    <li>Redeeming the time, because the days are <i>nana</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the <i>Duchess</i> is.
    </li>
    <li>And be not <i>bevvied</i> with <i>sherry</i>, wherein is excess; but be filled with the <i>Fairy</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual <i>chants</i>, singing and making melody in your <i>thumping cheat</i> to the <i>Duchess</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Giving thanks always for all <i>fakements</i> unto <i>Gloria</i> and the <i>Auntie</i> in the name of our <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Submitting yourselves <i>una</i> to another in the fear of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Palone affairs</i>, submit yourselves unto your own <i>homie affairs</i>, as unto the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>homie affair</i> is the <i>eke</i> of the <i>palone affair</i>, even as <i>Crystal</i> is the <i>eke</i> of the <i>meshigener carsey</i>: and <i>she</i> is the saviour of the <i>lucoddy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore as the <i>meshigener carsey</i> is subject unto <i>Crystal</i>, so let the <i>palone affairs</i> be to their own <i>homie affairs</i> in every <i>fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Homie affairs</i>, love your <i>palone affairs</i>, even as <i>Crystal</i> also loved the <i>meshigener carsey</i>, and <i>parkered</i> himself for it;
    </li>
    <li>That <i>she</i> might <i>bonafy</i> and cleanse it with the washing of <i>aqua</i> by the <i>lav</i>,
    </li>
    <li>That <i>she</i> might present it to himself a <i>fabe</i> <i>meshigener carsey</i>, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such <i>fakement</i>; but that it should be <i>fabulosa</i> and <i>nanti</i> blemish.
    </li>
    <li>So ought <i>homies</i> to love their <i>palone affairs</i> as their own bodies. <i>She</i> that loveth <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i> loveth himself.
    </li>
    <li>For no <i>homie</i> ever yet hated <i>her</i> own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the <i>Duchess</i> the <i>meshigener carsey</i>:
    </li>
    <li>For we are members of <i>her</i> <i>lucoddy</i>, of <i>her</i> flesh, and of <i>her</i> bones.
    </li>
    <li>For this cause shall a <i>homie</i> leave <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> and mother, and shall be joined unto <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>, and they <i>dewey</i> shall be <i>una</i> flesh.
    </li>
    <li>This is a <i>dowry</i> mystery: but I <i>cackle</i> concerning <i>Crystal</i> and the <i>meshigener carsey</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> let every <i>una</i> of you in particular so love <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i> even as himself; and the <i>palone affair</i> <i>varda</i> that she reverence her <i>homie affair</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Chavvies</i>, obey your parents in the <i>Duchess</i>: for this is <i>sweet</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Honour thy <i>Auntie</i> and mother; which is the first <i>butch lav</i> with promise;
    </li>
    <li>That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.
    </li>
    <li>And, ye <i>aunties</i>, provoke not your <i>chavvies</i> to wrath: but <i>parker</i> them up in the nurture and admonition of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Serving homies</i>, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your <i>thumping cheat</i>, as unto <i>Crystal</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the <i>serving homies</i> of <i>Crystal</i>, doing the will of <i>Gloria</i> from the <i>thumping cheat</i>;
    </li>
    <li>With <i>bona</i> will doing service, as to the <i>Duchess</i>, and not to <i>homies</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Knowing that whatsoever <i>bona</i> <i>fakement</i> any <i>homie</i> doeth, the same shall <i>she</i> <i>lall</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, whether <i>she</i> be bond or free.
    </li>
    <li>And, ye masters, do the same <i>fakements</i> unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; <i>nishta</i> is there respect of persons with <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Finally, my <i>sisters</i>, be <i>butch</i> in the <i>Duchess</i>, and in the power of <i>her</i> might.
    </li>
    <li>Put on the whole armour of <i>Gloria</i>, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
    </li>
    <li>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the <i>munge</i> of this world, against spiritual <i>naffness</i> in high places.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore <i>lell</i> unto you the whole armour of <i>Gloria</i>, that ye may be able to withstand in the <i>nana</i> <i>journo</i>, and having done all, to stand.
    </li>
    <li>Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the <i>basque</i> of <i>bonaness</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And your <i>plates</i> shod with the preparation of the <i>gossip</i> of peace;
    </li>
    <li>Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the <i>naff</i>.
    </li>
