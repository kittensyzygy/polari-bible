    <h1>Hebrews</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <ol>
  <li><i>Gloria</i>, who at sundry times and in divers manners <i>cackled</i> in time past unto the <i>aunties</i> by the prophets,
  </li>
  <li>Hath in these last days <i>cackled</i> unto us by <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>, whom <i>she</i> hath appointed heir of all <i>fakements</i>, by whom also <i>she</i> made the worlds;
  </li>
  <li>Who being the brightness of <i>her</i> <i>fabeness</i>, and the express image of <i>her</i> person, and upholding all <i>fakements</i> by the <i>lav</i> of <i>her</i> power, when <i>she</i> had by himself purged our <i>kertervers</i>, sat down on the <i>sweet martini</i> of the <i>fabularity</i> on high:
  </li>
  <li>Being made so <i>dowry</i> <i>benar</i> than the <i>fairies</i>, as <i>she</i> hath by inheritance obtained a more <i>fantabulosa</i> name than they.
  </li>
  <li>For unto which of the <i>fairies</i> <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i> at any time, Thou art my <i>homie chavvie</i>, this <i>journo</i> have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to <i>her</i> a <i>Auntie</i>, and <i>she</i> shall be to me a <i>homie chavvie</i>?
  </li>
  <li>And again, when <i>she</i> <i>parkereth</i> in the firstbegotten into the world, <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i>, And let all the <i>fairies</i> of <i>Gloria</i> worship <i>her</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And of the <i>fairies</i> <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i>, Who maketh <i>her</i> <i>fairies</i> <i>fairies</i>, and <i>her</i> ministers a flame of <i>binco fakement</i>.
  </li>
  <li>But unto the <i>homie chavvie</i> <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i>, Thy throne, O <i>Gloria</i>, is for ever and ever: a <i>choad</i> of <i>bonaness</i> is the <i>choad</i> of thy kingdom.
  </li>
  <li>Thou hast loved <i>bonaness</i>, and hated <i>codness</i>; therefore <i>Gloria</i>, even thy <i>Gloria</i>, hath anointed thee with the <i>lube</i> of gladness above thy fellows.
  </li>
  <li>And, Thou, <i>Duchess</i>, in the beginning hast <i>laued</i> the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine <i>fambles</i>:
  </li>
  <li>They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax <i>badge</i> as doth a <i>frock</i>;
  </li>
  <li>And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.
  </li>
  <li>But to which of the <i>fairies</i> <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i> at any time, <i>lett</i> on my <i>sweet martini</i>, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?
  </li>
  <li>Are they not all ministering <i>fairies</i>, <i>laued</i> forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?
  </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>Therefore we ought to <i>parker</i> the more earnest heed to the <i>fakements</i> which we have <i>aunt nelled</i>, lest at any time we should let them slip.
  </li>
  <li>For if the <i>lav</i> <i>cackled</i> by <i>fairies</i> was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience <i>lalled</i> a just recompence of <i>parkering</i>;
  </li>
  <li>How shall we escape, if we neglect so <i>dowry</i> salvation; which at the first began to be <i>cackled</i> by the <i>Duchess</i>, and was confirmed unto us by them that <i>aunt nelled</i> <i>her</i>;
  </li>
  <li><i>Gloria</i> also bearing them <i>varda-ing fakement</i>, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>, according to <i>her</i> own will?
  </li>
  <li>For unto the <i>fairies</i> hath <i>she</i> not put in subjection the world to <i>troll</i>, whereof we <i>cackle</i>.
  </li>
  <li>But <i>una</i> in a certain place testified, <i>cackling</i>, What is <i>homie</i>, that thou art mindful of <i>her</i>? or the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> that thou visitest <i>her</i>?
  </li>
  <li>Thou madest <i>her</i> a <i>bijou</i> lower than the <i>fairies</i>; thou crownedst <i>her</i> with <i>fabeness</i> and honour, and didst set <i>her</i> over the works of thy <i>fambles</i>:
  </li>
  <li>Thou hast put all <i>fakements</i> in subjection under <i>her</i> <i>plates</i>. For in that <i>she</i> put all in subjection under <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> <i>dry</i> <i>nishter</i> that is not put under <i>her</i>. But now we <i>varda</i> not yet all <i>fakements</i> put under <i>her</i>.
  </li>
  <li>But we <i>varda</i> <i>Josie</i>, who was made a <i>bijou</i> lower than the <i>fairies</i> for the suffering of <i>carking it</i>, crowned with <i>fabeness</i> and honour; that <i>she</i> by the <i>gracie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> should taste <i>carking it</i> for every <i>homie</i>.
  </li>
  <li>For it became <i>her</i>, for whom are all <i>fakements</i>, and by whom are all <i>fakements</i>, in bringing many <i>homie chavvies</i> unto <i>fabeness</i>, to make the captain of their salvation <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i> through sufferings.
  </li>
  <li>For both <i>she</i> that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of <i>una</i>: for which cause <i>she</i> is not ashamed to <i>screech</i> them <i>sisters</i>,
  </li>
  <li><i>Cackling</i>, I will <i>screech</i> thy name unto my <i>sisters</i>, in the midst of the <i>meshigener carsey</i> will I sing praise unto thee.
  </li>
  <li>And again, I will put my trust in <i>her</i>. And again, <i>varda</i> I and the <i>chavvies</i> which <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>parkered</i> me.
  </li>
  <li>Forasmuch then as the <i>chavvies</i> are partakers of flesh and blood, <i>she</i> also himself likewise <i>lelled</i> part of the same; that through <i>carking it</i> <i>she</i> might <i>battyfang</i> <i>her</i> that had the power of <i>carking it</i>, that is, the devil;
  </li>
  <li>And deliver them who through fear of <i>carking it</i> were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
  </li>
  <li>For verily <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> not on <i>her</i> the nature of <i>fairies</i>; but <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> on <i>her</i> the <i>maria</i> of Abraham.
  </li>
  <li>Wherefore in all <i>fakements</i> it behoved <i>her</i> to be made like unto <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, that <i>she</i> might be a merciful and <i>fabulous</i> high <i>godly homie</i> in <i>fakements</i> pertaining to <i>Gloria</i>, to make reconciliation for the <i>kertervers</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i>.
  </li>
  <li>For in that <i>she</i> himself hath suffered being tempted, <i>she</i> is able to succour them that are tempted.
  </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>Wherefore, <i>fabulosa</i> <i>sisters</i>, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High <i>godly homie</i> of our profession, <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i>;
  </li>
  <li>Who was <i>fabulous</i> to <i>her</i> that appointed <i>her</i>, as also <i>Maureen</i> was <i>fabulous</i> in all <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>.
  </li>
  <li>For this <i>homie</i> was counted <i>bona</i> of more <i>fabeness</i> than <i>Maureen</i>, inasmuch as <i>she</i> who hath builded the <i>lattie</i> hath more honour than the <i>lattie</i>.
  </li>
  <li>For every <i>lattie</i> is builded by some <i>homie</i>; but <i>she</i> that built all <i>fakements</i> is <i>Gloria</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>Maureen</i> verily was <i>fabulous</i> in all <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>, as a <i>serving homie</i>, for a testimony of those <i>fakements</i> which were to be <i>cackled</i> after;
  </li>
  <li>But <i>Crystal</i> as a <i>homie chavvie</i> over <i>her</i> own <i>lattie</i>; whose <i>lattie</i> are we, if we hold <i>nishta manjarry</i> the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.
  </li>
  <li>Wherefore (as the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i> <i>cackleth</i>, To <i>journo</i> if ye will <i>aunt nell</i> <i>her</i> <i>cackling fakement</i>,
  </li>
  <li>Harden not your <i>thumping cheats</i>, as in the provocation, in the <i>journo</i> of temptation in the <i>nishta smoke</i>:
  </li>
  <li>When your <i>aunties</i> tempted me, proved me, and <i>vardad</i> my works <i>quarter dacha</i> years.
  </li>
  <li>Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and <i>cackled</i>, They do alway err in their <i>thumping cheat</i>; and they have not known my ways.
  </li>
  <li>So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my <i>lettie</i>. )
  </li>
  <li><i>Lell</i> heed, <i>sisters</i>, lest there be in any of you an <i>nana</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> of unbelief, in departing from the living <i>Gloria</i>.
  </li>
  <li>But exhort <i>una</i> another daily, while it is <i>screeched</i> To <i>journo</i>; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of <i>kertever</i>.
  </li>
  <li>For we are made partakers of <i>Crystal</i>, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;
  </li>
  <li>While it is <i>cackled</i>, To <i>journo</i> if ye will <i>aunt nell</i> <i>her</i> <i>cackling fakement</i>, harden not your <i>thumping cheats</i>, as in the provocation.
  </li>
  <li>For some, when they had <i>aunt nelled</i>, did provoke: howbeit not all that <i>trolled</i> out of Egypt by <i>Maureen</i>.
  </li>
  <li>But with whom was <i>she</i> grieved <i>quarter dacha</i> years? was it not with them that had <i>kertervered</i>, whose carcases fell in the <i>nishta smoke</i>?
  </li>
  <li>And to whom sware <i>she</i> that they should not enter into <i>her</i> <i>lettie</i>, but to them that believed not?
  </li>
  <li>So we <i>varda</i> that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
  </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being <i>dry</i> us of entering into <i>her</i> <i>lettie</i>, any of you should seem to <i>troll</i> short of it.
  </li>
  <li>For unto us was the <i>gossip</i> <i>cackled</i>, as well as unto them: but the <i>lav</i> <i>cackled</i> did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that <i>aunt nelled</i> it.
  </li>
  <li>For we which have believed do enter into <i>lettie</i>, as <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my <i>lettie</i>: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.
  </li>
  <li>For <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> in a certain place of the <i>setterth</i> <i>journo</i> on this wise, And <i>Gloria</i> did <i>lettie</i> the <i>setterth</i> <i>journo</i> from all <i>her</i> works.
  </li>
  <li>And in this place again, If they shall enter into my <i>lettie</i>.
  </li>
  <li><i>Vardaing</i> therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first <i>cackled</i> entered not in because of unbelief:
  </li>
  <li>Again, <i>she</i> limiteth a certain <i>journo</i>, <i>cackling</i> in <i>Davina</i>, To <i>journo</i>, after so long a time; as it is <i>cackled</i>, To <i>journo</i> if ye will <i>aunt nell</i> <i>her</i> <i>cackling fakement</i>, harden not your <i>thumping cheats</i>.
  </li>
  <li>For if <i>Josie</i> had <i>parkered</i> them <i>lettie</i>, then would <i>she</i> not afterward have <i>cackled</i> of another <i>journo</i>.
  </li>
  <li>There remaineth therefore a <i>lettie</i> to the <i>homies and palones</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
  </li>
  <li>For <i>she</i> that is entered into <i>her</i> <i>lettie</i>, <i>she</i> also hath ceased from <i>her</i> own works, as <i>Gloria</i> did from <i>her</i>.
  </li>
  <li>Let us <i>acting dickey</i> therefore to enter into that <i>lettie</i>, lest any <i>homie</i> fall after the same example of unbelief.
  </li>
  <li>For the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i> is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged <i>dowry efink</i>, piercing even to the dividing asunder of <i>nishta lucoddy</i> and <i>Fairy</i>, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the <i>thumping cheat</i>.
  </li>
  <li><i>Nishta</i> is there any creature that is not manifest in <i>her</i> <i>vardaing</i>: but all <i>fakements</i> are <i>nanti zhoosh</i> and opened unto the <i>ogles</i> of <i>her</i> with whom we have to do.
  </li>
  <li><i>Vardaing</i> then that we have a <i>dowry</i> high <i>godly homie</i>, that is passed into the heavens, <i>Josie</i> the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, let us hold <i>nishta manjarry</i> our profession.
  </li>
  <li>For we have not an high <i>godly homie</i> which cannot be <i>reefed</i> with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet <i>nanti</i> <i>kertever</i>.
  </li>
  <li>Let us therefore <i>troll</i> boldly unto the throne of <i>gracie</i>, that we may obtain mercy, and find <i>gracie</i> to help in time of need.
  </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>For every high <i>godly homie</i> <i>lelled</i> from among <i>homies</i> is ordained for <i>homies</i> in <i>fakements</i> pertaining to <i>Gloria</i>, that <i>she</i> may offer both gifts and <i>parkers</i> for <i>kertervers</i>:
  </li>
  <li>Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that <i>she</i> himself also is compassed with infirmity.
  </li>
  <li>And by reason hereof <i>she</i> ought, as for the <i>homies and palones</i>, so also for himself, to offer for <i>kertervers</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And no <i>homie</i> <i>lelleth</i> this honour unto himself, but <i>she</i> that is <i>screeched</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, as was Aaron.
  </li>
  <li>So also <i>Crystal</i> glorified not himself to be made an high <i>godly homie</i>; but <i>she</i> that <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Thou art my <i>homie chavvie</i>, to <i>journo</i> have I begotten thee.
  </li>
  <li>As <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i> also in another place, Thou art a <i>godly homie</i> for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
  </li>
  <li>Who in the days of <i>her</i> flesh, when <i>she</i> had offered up <i>meshigener mutterings</i> and supplications with <i>butch</i> <i>screeching</i> and tears unto <i>her</i> that was able to save <i>her</i> from <i>carking it</i>, and was <i>aunt nelled</i> in that <i>she</i> feared;
  </li>
  <li>Though <i>she</i> were a <i>homie chavvie</i>, yet learned <i>she</i> obedience by the <i>fakements</i> which <i>she</i> suffered;
  </li>
  <li>And being made <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i>, <i>she</i> became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey <i>her</i>;
  </li>
  <li><i>Screeched</i> of <i>Gloria</i> an high <i>godly homie</i> after the order of Melchisedec.
  </li>
  <li>Of whom we have many <i>fakements</i> to <i>cackle</i>, and hard to be uttered, <i>vardaing</i> ye are dull of hearing.
  </li>
  <li>For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that <i>una</i> teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of <i>Gloria</i>; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of <i>butch</i> <i>carnish</i>.
  </li>
  <li>For every <i>una</i> that useth milk is unskilful in the <i>lav</i> of <i>bonaness</i>: for <i>she</i> is a <i>chavvy</i>.
  </li>
  <li>But <i>butch</i> <i>carnish</i> belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both <i>bona</i> and <i>nana</i>.
  </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of <i>Crystal</i>, let us <i>troll</i> on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from <i>stiff</i> works, and of faith toward <i>Gloria</i>,
  </li>
  <li>Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of <i>fambles</i>, and of resurrection of the <i>stiff</i>, and of eternal judgment.
  </li>
  <li>And this will we do, if <i>Gloria</i> permit.
  </li>
  <li>For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>,
  </li>
  <li>And have tasted the <i>bona</i> <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and the powers of the world to <i>troll</i>,
  </li>
  <li>If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; <i>vardaing</i> they crucify to themselves the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> afresh, and put <i>her</i> to an open <i>scharda</i>.
  </li>
  <li>For the earth which <i>buvareth</i> in the rain that <i>trolleth</i> oft upon it, and <i>parkereth</i> forth herbs meet for them by whom it is <i>zhooshed</i>, receiveth <i>bona lav</i> from <i>Gloria</i>:
  </li>
  <li>But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is <i>ajax</i> unto cursing; whose end is to be burned.
  </li>
  <li>But, beloved, we are persuaded <i>benar</i> <i>fakements</i> of you, and <i>fakements</i> that accompany salvation, though we thus <i>cackle</i>.
  </li>
  <li>For <i>Gloria</i> is not unrighteous to forget your <i>acting dickey</i> and <i>acting dickey</i> of love, which ye have shewed toward <i>her</i> name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.
  </li>
  <li>And we <i>fancy</i> that every <i>una</i> of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:
  </li>
  <li>That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
  </li>
  <li>For when <i>Gloria</i> made promise to Abraham, because <i>she</i> could swear by no <i>dowrier</i>, <i>she</i> sware by himself,
  </li>
  <li><i>Cackling</i>, Surely <i>bona lav</i> I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.
  </li>
  <li>And so, after <i>she</i> had patiently endured, <i>she</i> obtained the promise.
  </li>
  <li>For <i>homies</i> verily swear by the <i>dowrier</i>: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.
  </li>
  <li>Wherein <i>Gloria</i>, willing more <i>dowrily</i> to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of <i>her</i> counsel, confirmed it by an oath:
  </li>
  <li>That by <i>dewey</i> immutable <i>fakements</i>, in which it was impossible for <i>Gloria</i> to lie, we might have a <i>butch</i> consolation, who have fled for refuge to <i>lett</i> hold upon the hope set before us:
  </li>
  <li>Which hope we have as an anchor of the <i>nishta lucoddy</i>, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;
  </li>
  <li>Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even <i>Josie</i>, made an high <i>godly homie</i> for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
  </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>For this Melchisedec, <i>dowriest homie</i> of Salem, <i>godly homie</i> of the most high <i>Gloria</i>, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the <i>dowriest homies</i>, and <i>fabed</i> <i>her</i>;
  </li>
  <li>To whom also Abraham <i>parkered</i> a <i>dachath</i> part of all; first being by interpretation <i>dowriest homie</i> of <i>bonaness</i>, and after that also <i>dowriest homie</i> of Salem, which is, <i>dowriest homie</i> of peace;
  </li>
  <li><i>Nanti</i> <i>Auntie</i>, <i>nanti</i> mother, <i>nanti</i> <i>trolling down</i>, having <i>nishta</i> beginning of days, <i>nishta</i> end of life; but made like unto the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>; <i>letteth</i> a <i>godly homie</i> continually.
  </li>
  <li>Now consider how <i>dowry</i> this <i>homie</i> was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham <i>parkered</i> the <i>dachath</i> of the spoils.
  </li>
  <li>And verily they that are of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Levi, who <i>lall</i> the office of the priesthood, have a <i>butch lav</i> to <i>lell</i> tithes of the <i>homies and palones</i> according to the law, that is, of their <i>sisters</i>, though they <i>troll</i> out of the loins of Abraham:
  </li>
  <li>But <i>she</i> whose <i>trolling down</i> is not counted from them <i>lalled</i> tithes of Abraham, and <i>fabed</i> <i>her</i> that had the promises.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>nanti</i> all contradiction the <i>nanti dowry</i> is <i>fabed</i> of the <i>benar</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And here <i>homies</i> that <i>cark it</i> <i>lall</i> tithes; but there <i>she</i> receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that <i>she</i> <i>letteth</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And as I may so <i>cackle</i>, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.
  </li>
  <li>For <i>she</i> was yet in the loins of <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, when Melchisedec met <i>her</i>.
  </li>
  <li>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>lalled</i> the law,) what further need was there that another <i>godly homie</i> should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be <i>screeched</i> after the order of Aaron?
  </li>
  <li>For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.
  </li>
  <li>For <i>she</i> of whom these <i>fakements</i> are <i>cackled</i> pertaineth to another tribe, of which no <i>homie</i> <i>parkered</i> attendance at the <i>grovelling fakement</i>.
  </li>
  <li>For it is evident that our <i>Duchess</i> sprang out of Juda; of which tribe <i>Maureen</i> <i>cackled</i> <i>nishter</i> concerning priesthood.
  </li>
  <li>And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another <i>godly homie</i>,
  </li>
  <li>Who is made, not after the law of a carnal <i>butch lav</i>, but after the power of an endless life.
  </li>
  <li>For <i>she</i> testifieth, Thou art a <i>godly homie</i> for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
  </li>
  <li>For there is verily a disannulling of the <i>butch lav</i> going before for the <i>nelliness</i> and unprofitableness thereof.
  </li>
  <li>For the law made <i>nishter</i> <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i>, but the bringing in of a <i>benar</i> hope did; by the which we draw <i>ajax</i> unto <i>Gloria</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And inasmuch as not <i>nanti</i> an oath <i>she</i> was made <i>godly homie</i>:
  </li>
  <li>(For those <i>godly homies</i> were made <i>nanti</i> an oath; but this with an oath by <i>her</i> that <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, The <i>Duchess</i> sware and will not repent, Thou art a <i>godly homie</i> for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)
  </li>
  <li>By so <i>dowry</i> was <i>Josie</i> made a surety of a <i>benar</i> testament.
  </li>
  <li>And they truly were many <i>godly homies</i>, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of <i>carking it</i>:
  </li>
  <li>But this <i>homie</i>, because <i>she</i> continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.
  </li>
  <li>Wherefore <i>she</i> is able also to save them to the uttermost that <i>troll</i> unto <i>Gloria</i> by <i>her</i>, <i>vardaing</i> <i>she</i> ever <i>letteth</i> to make intercession for them.
  </li>
  <li>For such an high <i>godly homie</i> became us, who is <i>fabulosa</i>, harmless, undefiled, separate from <i>kerterverers</i>, and made higher than the heavens;
  </li>
  <li>Who needeth not daily, as those high <i>godly homies</i>, to offer up <i>parker</i>, first for <i>her</i> own <i>kertervers</i>, and then for the <i>homies and palones</i>&#8216;s: for this <i>she</i> did once, when <i>she</i> offered up himself.
  </li>
  <li>For the law maketh <i>homies</i> high <i>godly homies</i> which have infirmity; but the <i>lav</i> of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the <i>homie chavvie</i>, who is consecrated for evermore.
  </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>Now of the <i>fakements</i> which we have <i>cackled</i> this is the sum: We have such an high <i>godly homie</i>, who is set on the <i>sweet martini</i> of the throne of the <i>fabularity</i> in the heavens;
  </li>
  <li>A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true <i>bijou tabernaclette</i>, which the <i>Duchess</i> pitched, and not <i>homie</i>.
  </li>
  <li>For every high <i>godly homie</i> is ordained to offer gifts and <i>parkers</i>: wherefore it is of necessity that this <i>homie</i> have somewhat also to offer.
  </li>
  <li>For if <i>she</i> were on earth, <i>she</i> should not be a <i>godly homie</i>, <i>vardaing</i> that there are <i>godly homies</i> that offer gifts according to the law:
  </li>
  <li>Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly <i>fakements</i>, as <i>Maureen</i> was admonished of <i>Gloria</i> when <i>she</i> was about to make the <i>bijou tabernaclette</i>: for, <i>varda</i>, <i>cackleth</i> <i>she</i>, that thou make all <i>fakements</i> according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.
  </li>
  <li>But now hath <i>she</i> obtained a more <i>fantabulosa</i> ministry, by how <i>dowry</i> also <i>she</i> is the mediator of a <i>benar</i> covenant, which was established upon <i>benar</i> promises.
  </li>
  <li>For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.
  </li>
  <li>For finding fault with them, <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i>, <i>varda</i>, the days <i>troll</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, when I will make a new covenant with the <i>lattie</i> of Israel and with the <i>lattie</i> of Judah:
  </li>
  <li>Not according to the covenant that I made with their <i>aunties</i> in the <i>journo</i> when I <i>lelled</i> them by the <i>famble</i> to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
  </li>
  <li>For this is the covenant that I will make with the <i>lattie</i> of Israel after those days, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>; I will put my laws into their mind, and <i>screeve</i> them in their <i>thumping cheats</i>: and I will be to them a <i>Gloria</i>, and they shall be to me a <i>homies and palones</i>:
  </li>
  <li>And they shall not teach every <i>homie</i> <i>her</i> <i>homie ajax</i>, and every <i>homie</i> <i>her</i> <i>sister</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Know the <i>Duchess</i>: for all shall know me, from the <i>nanti dowriest</i> to the <i>dowriest</i>.
  </li>
  <li>For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their <i>kertervers</i> and their <i>cods</i> will I remember <i>nishta</i>.
  </li>
  <li>In that <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i>, A new covenant, <i>she</i> hath made the first <i>badge</i>. Now that which decayeth and waxeth <i>badge</i> is ready to vanish away.
  </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.
  </li>
  <li>For there was a <i>bijou tabernaclette</i> made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is <i>screeched</i> the sanctuary.
  </li>
  <li>And after the second veil, the <i>bijou tabernaclette</i> which is <i>screeched</i> the Holiest of all;
  </li>
  <li>Which had the golden censer, and the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the covenant overlaid round about with <i>gelt</i>, wherein was the golden pot that had <i>pannan</i>, and Aaron&#8217;s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;
  </li>
  <li>And over it the cherubims of <i>fabeness</i> shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now <i>cackle</i> particularly.
  </li>
  <li>Now when these <i>fakements</i> were thus ordained, the <i>godly homies</i> <i>trolled</i> always into the first <i>bijou tabernaclette</i>, accomplishing the service of <i>Gloria</i>.
  </li>
  <li>But into the second <i>trolled</i> the high <i>godly homie</i> alone once every year, not <i>nanti</i> blood, which <i>she</i> offered for himself, and for the errors of the <i>homies and palones</i>:
  </li>
  <li>The <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i> this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first <i>bijou tabernaclette</i> was yet standing:
  </li>
  <li>Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and <i>parkers</i>, that could not make <i>her</i> that did the service <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i>, as pertaining to the conscience;
  </li>
  <li>Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.
  </li>
  <li>But <i>Crystal</i> being <i>troll</i> an high <i>godly homie</i> of <i>bona</i> <i>fakements</i> to <i>troll</i>, by a <i>dowrier</i> and more <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i> <i>bijou tabernaclette</i>, not made with <i>fambles</i>, that is to <i>cackle</i>, not of this building;
  </li>
  <li><i>Nishta</i> by the blood of goats and calves, but by <i>her</i> own blood <i>she</i> entered in once into the <i>fabulosa</i> place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.
  </li>
  <li>For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the <i>nanti sparkle</i>, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:
  </li>
  <li>How <i>dowry</i> more shall the blood of <i>Crystal</i>, who through the eternal <i>Fairy</i> offered himself <i>nanti</i> spot to <i>Gloria</i>, purge your conscience from <i>stiff</i> works to serve the living <i>Gloria</i>?
  </li>
  <li>And for this cause <i>she</i> is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of <i>carking it</i>, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are <i>screeched</i> might <i>lall</i> the promise of eternal inheritance.
  </li>
  <li>For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the <i>carking it</i> of the testator.
  </li>
  <li>For a testament is of force after <i>homies</i> are <i>stiff</i>: otherwise it is of no <i>butchness</i> at all while the testator <i>letteth</i>.
  </li>
  <li>Whereupon <i>nishta</i> the first testament was dedicated <i>nanti</i> blood.
  </li>
  <li>For when <i>Maureen</i> had <i>cackled</i> every precept to all the <i>homies and palones</i> according to the law, <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> the blood of calves and of goats, with <i>aqua</i>, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the <i>glossy</i>, and all the <i>homies and palones</i>,
  </li>
  <li><i>Cackling</i>, This is the blood of the testament which <i>Gloria</i> hath enjoined unto you.
  </li>
  <li>Moreover <i>she</i> sprinkled with blood both the <i>bijou tabernaclette</i>, and all the <i>fakements</i> of the ministry.
  </li>
  <li>And almost all <i>fakements</i> are by the law purged with blood; and <i>nanti</i> shedding of blood is no remission.
  </li>
  <li>It was therefore necessary that the patterns of <i>fakements</i> in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly <i>fakements</i> themselves with <i>benar</i> <i>parkers</i> than these.
  </li>
  <li>For <i>Crystal</i> is not entered into the <i>fabulosa</i> places made with <i>fambles</i>, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of <i>Gloria</i> for us:
  </li>
  <li><i>Nishta</i> yet that <i>she</i> should offer himself often, as the high <i>godly homie</i> entereth into the <i>fabulosa</i> place every year with blood of others;
  </li>
  <li>For then must <i>she</i> often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath <i>she</i> appeared to put away <i>kertever</i> by the <i>parker</i> of himself.
  </li>
  <li>And as it is appointed unto <i>homies</i> once to <i>cark it</i>, but after this the judgment:
  </li>
  <li>So <i>Crystal</i> was once offered to bear the <i>kertervers</i> of many; and unto them that <i>varda</i> for <i>her</i> shall <i>she</i> appear the second time <i>nanti</i> <i>kertever</i> unto salvation.
  </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>For the law having a shadow of <i>bona</i> <i>fakements</i> to <i>troll</i>, and not the <i>dowry</i> image of the <i>fakements</i>, can never with those <i>parkers</i> which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i>.
  </li>
  <li>For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had <i>nishta</i> conscience of <i>kertervers</i>.
  </li>
  <li>But in those <i>parkers</i> there is a remembrance again made of <i>kertervers</i> every year.
  </li>
  <li>For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should <i>lell</i> away <i>kertervers</i>.
  </li>
  <li>Wherefore when <i>she</i> <i>trolleth</i> into the world, <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i>, <i>parker</i> and <i>parkering</i> thou wouldest not, but a <i>lucoddy</i> hast thou prepared me:
  </li>
  <li>In burnt <i>parkerings</i> and <i>parkers</i> for <i>kertever</i> thou hast had no pleasure.
  </li>
  <li>Then <i>cackled</i> I, Lo, I <i>troll</i> (in the volume of the <i>glossy</i> it is <i>screeved</i> of me,) to do thy will, O <i>Gloria</i>.
  </li>
  <li>Above when <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>parker</i> and <i>parkering</i> and burnt <i>parkerings</i> and <i>parkering</i> for <i>kertever</i> thou wouldest not, <i>nishta</i> hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law;
  </li>
  <li>Then <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i>, Lo, I <i>troll</i> to do thy will, O <i>Gloria</i>. <i>She</i> <i>lelleth</i> away the first, that <i>she</i> may establish the second.
  </li>
  <li>By the which will we are sanctified through the <i>parkering</i> of the <i>lucoddy</i> of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> once for all.
  </li>
  <li>And every <i>godly homie</i> standeth daily ministering and <i>parkering</i> oftentimes the same <i>parkers</i>, which can never <i>lell</i> away <i>kertervers</i>:
  </li>
  <li>But this <i>homie</i>, after <i>she</i> had offered <i>una</i> <i>parker</i> for <i>kertervers</i> for ever, sat down on the <i>sweet martini</i> of <i>Gloria</i>;
  </li>
  <li>From henceforth expecting till <i>her</i> enemies be made <i>her</i> footstool.
  </li>
  <li>For by <i>una</i> <i>parkering</i> <i>she</i> hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.
  </li>
  <li>Whereof the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i> also is a <i>varda-ing fakement</i> to us: for after that <i>she</i> had <i>cackled</i> before,
  </li>
  <li>This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, I will put my laws into their <i>thumping cheats</i>, and in their minds will I <i>screeve</i> them;
  </li>
  <li>And their <i>kertervers</i> and <i>cods</i> will I remember <i>nishta</i>.
  </li>
  <li>Now where remission of these is, there is <i>nishta</i> <i>parkering</i> for <i>kertever</i>.
  </li>
  <li>Having therefore, <i>sisters</i>, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of <i>Josie</i>,
  </li>
  <li>By a new and living way, which <i>she</i> hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to <i>cackle</i>, <i>her</i> flesh;
  </li>
  <li>And having an high <i>godly homie</i> over the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>;
  </li>
  <li>Let us draw near with a true <i>thumping cheat</i> in full assurance of faith, having our <i>thumping cheats</i> sprinkled from an <i>nana</i> conscience, and our bodies <i>dhobied</i> with pure <i>aqua</i>.
  </li>
  <li>Let us hold <i>nishta manjarry</i> the profession of our faith <i>nanti</i> wavering; (for <i>she</i> is <i>fabulous</i> that promised;)
  </li>
  <li>And let us consider <i>una</i> another to provoke unto love and to <i>bona</i> works:
  </li>
  <li>Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting <i>una</i> another: and so <i>dowry</i> the more, as ye <i>varda</i> the <i>journo</i> approaching.
  </li>
  <li>For if we <i>kertever</i> wilfully after that we have <i>lalled</i> the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth <i>nishta</i> <i>parker</i> for <i>kertervers</i>,
  </li>
  <li>But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.
  </li>
  <li><i>She</i> that despised <i>Maureen</i>&#8216; law <i>carked it</i> <i>nanti</i> mercy under <i>dewey</i> or <i>trey</i> witnesses:
  </li>
  <li>Of how <i>dowry</i> sorer <i>zsa zsa-ing</i>, suppose ye, shall <i>she</i> be thought <i>bona</i>, who hath <i>minced</i> under <i>plate</i> the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith <i>she</i> was sanctified, an <i>nanna</i> <i>fakement</i>, and hath done despite unto the <i>Fairy</i> of <i>gracie</i>?
  </li>
  <li>For we know <i>her</i> that hath <i>cackled</i>, <i>the rights</i> belongeth unto me, I will recompense, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>. And again, The <i>Duchess</i> shall <i>beak</i> <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>.
  </li>
  <li>It is a fearful <i>fakement</i> to fall into the <i>fambles</i> of the living <i>Gloria</i>.
  </li>
  <li>But <i>screech</i> to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a <i>dowry</i> <i>palaver</i> of afflictions;
  </li>
  <li>Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.
  </li>
  <li>For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and <i>lelled</i> joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a <i>benar</i> and an enduring substance.
  </li>
  <li>Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath <i>dowry</i> recompence of <i>parkering</i>.
  </li>
  <li>For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of <i>Gloria</i>, ye might <i>lall</i> the promise.
  </li>
  <li>For yet a <i>bijou</i> while, and <i>she</i> that shall <i>troll</i> will <i>troll</i>, and will not tarry.
  </li>
  <li>Now the just shall live by faith: but if any <i>homie</i> draw back, my <i>nishta lucoddy</i> shall have no pleasure in <i>her</i>.
  </li>
  <li>But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the <i>nishta lucoddy</i>.
  </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>Now faith is the substance of <i>fakements</i> hoped for, the evidence of <i>fakements</i> not <i>vardad</i>.
  </li>
  <li>For by it the <i>fungi</i> obtained a <i>bona</i> report.
  </li>
  <li>Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, so that <i>fakements</i> which are <i>vardad</i> were not made of <i>fakements</i> which do appear.
  </li>
  <li>By faith Abel offered unto <i>Gloria</i> a more <i>fantabulosa</i> <i>parker</i> than Cain, by which <i>she</i> obtained <i>varda-ing fakement</i> that <i>she</i> was <i>bona</i>, <i>Gloria</i> testifying of <i>her</i> gifts: and by it <i>she</i> being <i>stiff</i> yet <i>cackleth</i>.
  </li>
  <li>By faith Enoch was translated that <i>she</i> should not <i>varda</i> <i>carking it</i>; and was not found, because <i>Gloria</i> had translated <i>her</i>: for before <i>her</i> translation <i>she</i> had this testimony, that <i>she</i> pleased <i>Gloria</i>.
  </li>
  <li>But <i>nanti</i> faith it is impossible to please <i>her</i>: for <i>she</i> that <i>trolleth</i> to <i>Gloria</i> must believe that <i>she</i> is, and that <i>she</i> is a rewarder of them that diligently <i>charper</i> <i>her</i>.
  </li>
  <li>By faith <i>Norah</i>, being warned of <i>Gloria</i> of <i>fakements</i> not <i>vardad</i> as yet, <i>trolled</i> with fear, prepared an <i>bijou arkette</i> to the saving of <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>; by the which <i>she</i> condemned the world, and became heir of the <i>bonaness</i> which is by faith.
  </li>
  <li>By faith Abraham, when <i>she</i> was <i>screeched</i> to <i>troll out</i> into a place which <i>she</i> should after <i>lall</i> for an inheritance, obeyed; and <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> out, not knowing whither <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i>.
  </li>
  <li>By faith <i>she</i> sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in <i>bijoux tabernaclettes</i> with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with <i>her</i> of the same promise:
  </li>
  <li>For <i>she</i> looked for a <i>smoke</i> which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is <i>Gloria</i>.
  </li>
  <li>Through faith also Sara herself <i>lalled</i> <i>butchness</i> to conceive <i>maria</i>, and was <i>laued</i> of a <i>chavvie</i> when she was past age, because she judged <i>her</i> <i>fabulous</i> who had promised.
  </li>
  <li>Therefore sprang there even of <i>una</i>, and <i>her</i> as <i>bona</i> as <i>stiff</i>, so many as the <i>twinkling fakements</i> of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.
  </li>
  <li>These all <i>carked it</i> in faith, not having <i>lalled</i> the promises, but having <i>vardad</i> them <i>nishta ajax</i> off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
  </li>
  <li>For they that <i>cackle</i> such <i>fakements</i> <i>screech</i> plainly that they <i>charper</i> a country.
  </li>
  <li>And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they <i>trolled</i> out, they might have had opportunity to have <i>trolled back</i>.
  </li>
  <li>But now they <i>fancy</i> a <i>benar</i> country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore <i>Gloria</i> is not ashamed to be <i>screeched</i> their <i>Gloria</i>: for <i>she</i> hath prepared for them a <i>smoke</i>.
  </li>
  <li>By faith Abraham, when <i>she</i> was tried, offered up Isaac: and <i>she</i> that had <i>lalled</i> the promises offered up <i>her</i> only begotten <i>homie chavvie</i>,
  </li>
  <li>Of whom it was <i>cackled</i>, That in Isaac shall thy <i>maria</i> be <i>screeched</i>:
  </li>
  <li>Accounting that <i>Gloria</i> was able to raise <i>her</i> up, even from the <i>stiff</i>; from whence also <i>she</i> <i>lalled</i> <i>her</i> in a figure.
  </li>
  <li>By faith Isaac <i>fabed</i> Jacob and Esau concerning <i>fakements</i> to <i>troll</i>.
  </li>
  <li>By faith Jacob, when <i>she</i> was a dying, <i>fabed</i> both the <i>homie chavvies</i> of <i>Josephine</i>; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of <i>her</i> <i>trolling fakement</i>.
  </li>
  <li>By faith <i>Josephine</i>, when <i>she</i> <i>carked it</i>, made mention of the departing of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel; and <i>parkered</i> <i>butch lav</i> concerning <i>her</i> bones.
  </li>
  <li>By faith <i>Maureen</i>, when <i>she</i> was born, was hid <i>trey</i> months of <i>her</i> parents, because they <i>vardad</i> <i>she</i> was a proper <i>chavvie</i>; and they were not afraid of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>butch lav</i>.
  </li>
  <li>By faith <i>Maureen</i>, when <i>she</i> was <i>troll</i> to years, refused to be <i>screeched</i> the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Pharaoh&#8217;s <i>palone chavvie</i>;
  </li>
  <li>Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the <i>homies and palones</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, than to enjoy the pleasures of <i>kertever</i> for a season;
  </li>
  <li>Esteeming the reproach of <i>Crystal</i> <i>dowrier</i> riches than the <i>gelt</i> in Egypt: for <i>she</i> had respect unto the recompence of the <i>parkering</i>.
  </li>
  <li>By faith <i>she</i> forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the <i>dowriest homie</i>: for <i>she</i> endured, as <i>vardaing</i> <i>her</i> who is invisible.
  </li>
  <li>Through faith <i>she</i> kept the <i>trollover</i>, and the sprinkling of blood, lest <i>she</i> that <i>battyfanged</i> the firstborn should <i>reef</i> them.
  </li>
  <li>By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.
  </li>
  <li>By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about <i>setter</i> days.
  </li>
  <li>By faith the <i>charvering donna</i> Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had <i>lalled</i> the spies with peace.
  </li>
  <li>And what shall I more <i>cackle</i>? for the time would fail me to <i>cackle</i> of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of <i>Davina</i> also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:
  </li>
  <li>Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought <i>bonaness</i>, obtained promises, stopped the <i>screeches</i> of lions.
  </li>
  <li>Quenched the <i>slapping</i> of <i>binco fakement</i>, <i>scarpered</i> the edge of the <i>dowry efink</i>, out of <i>nelliness</i> were made <i>butch</i>, waxed valiant in <i>palaver</i>, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.
  </li>
  <li><i>Palones</i> <i>lalled</i> their <i>stiff</i> raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a <i>benar</i> resurrection:
  </li>
  <li>And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, <i>any road up</i>, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:
  </li>
  <li>They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were <i>ferricadoozed</i> with the <i>dowry efink</i>: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;
  </li>
  <li>(Of whom the world was not <i>bona</i>:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.
  </li>
  <li>And these all, having obtained a <i>bona</i> report through faith, <i>lalled</i> not the promise:
  </li>
  <li><i>Gloria</i> having provided some <i>benar</i> <i>fakement</i> for us, that they <i>nanti</i> us should not be made <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i>.
  </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>Wherefore <i>vardaing</i> we also are compassed about with so <i>dowry</i> a cloud of witnesses, let us <i>lett</i> aside every weight, and the <i>kertever</i> which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,
  </li>
  <li>Looking unto <i>Josie</i> the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before <i>her</i> endured the cross, despising the <i>scharda</i>, and is set down at the <i>sweet martini</i> of the throne of <i>Gloria</i>.
  </li>
  <li>For consider <i>her</i> that endured such contradiction of <i>kerterverers</i> against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.
  </li>
  <li>Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against <i>kertever</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And ye have forgotten the exhortation which <i>cackleth</i> unto you as unto <i>chavvies</i>, My <i>homie chavvie</i>, despise not thou the chastening of the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>nishta</i> faint when thou art rebuked of <i>her</i>:
  </li>
  <li>For whom the <i>Duchess</i> loveth <i>she</i> chasteneth, and scourgeth every <i>homie chavvie</i> whom <i>she</i> receiveth.
  </li>
  <li>If ye endure chastening, <i>Gloria</i> dealeth with you as with <i>homie chavvies</i>; for what <i>homie chavvie</i> is <i>she</i> whom the <i>Auntie</i> chasteneth not?
  </li>
  <li>But if ye be <i>nanti</i> chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not <i>homie chavvies</i>.
  </li>
  <li>Furthermore we have had <i>aunties</i> of our flesh which corrected us, and we <i>parkered</i> them reverence: shall we not <i>dowry</i> rather be in subjection unto the <i>Auntie</i> of <i>fairies</i>, and live?
  </li>
  <li>For they verily for a <i>nishta dowry</i> days chastened us after their own pleasure; but <i>she</i> for our profit, that we might be partakers of <i>her</i> holiness.
  </li>
  <li>Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but <i>naff</i>: <i>any road up</i> afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of <i>bonaness</i> unto them which are exercised thereby.
  </li>
  <li>Wherefore lift up the <i>fambles</i> which hang down, and the feeble knees;
  </li>
  <li>And make <i>hettie</i> paths for your <i>plates</i>, lest that which is <i>nanti wallop</i> be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.
  </li>
  <li><i>Troll after</i> peace with all <i>homies</i>, and holiness, <i>nanti</i> which no <i>homie</i> shall <i>varda</i> the <i>Duchess</i>:
  </li>
  <li>Looking diligently lest any <i>homie</i> fail of the <i>gracie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;
  </li>
  <li>Lest there be any fornicator, or <i>billingsgate</i> person, as Esau, who for <i>una</i> morsel of <i>carnish</i> sold <i>her</i> birthright.
  </li>
  <li>For ye know how that afterward, when <i>she</i> would have inherited the <i>bona lav</i>, <i>she</i> was rejected: for <i>she</i> found no place of repentance, though <i>she</i> sought it carefully with tears.
  </li>
  <li>For ye are not <i>troll</i> unto the mount that might be <i>reefed</i>, and that burned with <i>binco fakement</i>, <i>nishta</i> unto blackness, and <i>munge</i>, and tempest,
  </li>
  <li>And the sound of a <i>tooting fakement</i>, and the <i>cackling fakement</i> of <i>lavs</i>; which <i>cackling fakement</i> they that <i>aunt nelled</i> intreated that the <i>lav</i> should not be <i>cackled</i> to them any more:
  </li>
  <li>(For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so <i>dowry</i> as a beast <i>reef</i> the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:
  </li>
  <li>And so <i>nanna</i> was the <i>vardaing</i>, that <i>Maureen</i> <i>cackled</i>, I exceedingly fear and quake:)
  </li>
  <li>But ye are <i>troll</i> unto mount Sion, and unto the <i>smoke</i> of the living <i>Gloria</i>, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of <i>fairies</i>,

  <li>To the general assembly and <i>meshigener carsey</i> of the firstborn, which are <i>screeved</i> in heaven, and to <i>Gloria</i> the <i>beak</i> of all, and to the <i>fairies</i> of just <i>homies</i> made <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i>,
  </li>
  <li>And to <i>Josie</i> the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that <i>cackleth</i> <i>benar</i> <i>fakements</i> that that of Abel.
  </li>
  <li><i>Varda</i> that ye refuse not <i>her</i> that <i>cackleth</i>. For if they <i>scarpered</i> not who refused <i>her</i> that <i>cackled</i> on earth, <i>dowry</i> more shall not we escape, if we turn away from <i>her</i> that <i>cackleth</i> from heaven:
  </li>
  <li>Whose <i>cackling fakement</i> then shook the earth: but now <i>she</i> hath promised, <i>cackling</i>, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.
  </li>
  <li>And this <i>lav</i>, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those <i>fakements</i> that are shaken, as of <i>fakements</i> that are made, that those <i>fakements</i> which cannot be shaken may remain.
  </li>
  <li>Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be <i>trolled</i>, let us have <i>gracie</i>, whereby we may serve <i>Gloria</i> acceptably with reverence and <i>fabe</i> fear:

  <li>Let your conversation be <i>nanti</i> <i>ogling</i>; and be content with such <i>fakements</i> as ye have: for <i>she</i> hath <i>cackled</i>, I will never leave thee, <i>nishta</i> forsake thee.
  </li>
  <li>So that we may boldly <i>cackle</i>, The <i>Duchess</i> is my helper, and I will not fear what <i>homie</i> shall do unto me.
  </li>
  <li>Remember them which have the rule over you, who have <i>cackled</i> unto you the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i>: whose faith <i>troll after</i>, considering the end of their conversation.
  </li>
  <li><i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> the same yesterday, and to <i>journo</i>, and for ever.
  </li>
  <li>Be not <i>lelled</i> about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is a <i>bona</i> <i>fakement</i> that the <i>thumping cheat</i> be established with <i>gracie</i>; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.
  </li>
  <li>We have an <i>grovelling fakement</i>, whereof they have no <i>sweet</i> to <i>jarry</i> which serve the <i>bijou tabernaclette</i>.
  </li>
  <li>For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high <i>godly homie</i> for <i>kertever</i>, are burned <i>nanti</i> the camp.
  </li>
  <li>Wherefore <i>Josie</i> also, that <i>she</i> might <i>bonafy</i> the <i>homies and palones</i> with <i>her</i> own blood, suffered <i>nanti</i> the gate.
  </li>
  <li>Let us <i>troll forth</i> therefore unto <i>her</i> <i>nanti</i> the camp, bearing <i>her</i> reproach.
  </li>
  <li>For here have we no continuing <i>smoke</i>, but we <i>charper</i> <i>una</i> to <i>troll</i>.
  </li>
  <li>By <i>her</i> therefore let us offer the <i>parker</i> of praise to <i>Gloria</i> continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to <i>her</i> name.
  </li>
  <li>But to do <i>bona</i> and to communicate forget not: for with such <i>parkers</i> <i>Gloria</i> is well pleased.
  </li>
  <li>Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they <i>varda</i> for your <i>nishta lucoddies</i>, as they that must <i>parker</i> account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you.
  </li>
  <li>Pray for us: for we trust we have a <i>bona</i> conscience, in all <i>fakements</i> willing to live honestly.
  </li>
  <li>But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.
  </li>
  <li>Now the <i>Gloria</i> of peace, that brought again from the <i>stiff</i> our <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i>, that <i>dowry</i> shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,
  </li>
  <li>Make you <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i> in every <i>bona</i> <i>acting dickey</i> to do <i>her</i> will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in <i>her</i> <i>vardaing</i>, through <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>; to whom be <i>fabeness</i> for ever and ever. <i>Larlou</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And I beseech you, <i>sisters</i>, suffer the <i>lav</i> of exhortation: for I have <i>screeved</i> a letter unto you in <i>nishta dowry</i> <i>lavs</i>.
  </li>
  <li>Know ye that our <i>sister</i> Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if <i>she</i> <i>troll</i> shortly, I will <i>varda</i> you.
  </li>
  <li>Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.
  </li>
  <li><i>Gracie</i> be with you all. <i>Larlou</i>.
