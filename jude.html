    <h1>Jude</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Jude, the <i>serving homie</i> of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, and <i>sister</i> of James, to them that are sanctified by <i>Gloria</i> the <i>Auntie</i>, and preserved in <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, and <i>screeched</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.
    </li>
    <li>Beloved, when I <i>parkered</i> all diligence to <i>screeve</i> unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to <i>screeve</i> unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once <i>laued</i> unto the saints.
    </li>
    <li>For there are certain <i>homies</i> crept in unawares, who were before of <i>badge</i> ordained to this condemnation, ungodly <i>homies</i>, turning the <i>gracie</i> of our <i>Gloria</i> into lasciviousness, and denying the only <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>, and our <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the <i>Duchess</i>, having saved the <i>homies and palones</i> out of the land of Egypt, afterward <i>battyfanged</i> them that believed not.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>fairies</i> which kept not their first estate, but <i>dry</i> their own habitation, <i>she</i> hath reserved in everlasting chains under <i>munge</i> unto the judgment of the <i>dowry</i> <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the <i>smokes</i> about them in like manner, giving themselves over to <i>charvering</i>, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the <i>the rights</i> of eternal <i>binco fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Likewise also these <i>manky</i> dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and <i>cackle</i> <i>nana</i> of dignities.
    </li>
    <li>Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil <i>she</i> disputed about the <i>lucoddy</i> of <i>Maureen</i>, durst not <i>parker</i> against <i>her</i> a railing accusation, but <i>cackled</i>, The <i>Duchess</i> rebuke thee.
    </li>
    <li>But these <i>cackle</i> <i>nana</i> of those <i>fakements</i> which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those <i>fakements</i> they corrupt themselves.
    </li>
    <li>Woe unto them! for they have <i>trolled</i> in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for <i>parkering</i>, and perished in the gainsaying of Core.
    </li>
    <li>These are spots in your <i>dowry munjarlees</i> of charity, when they <i>dowry munjarlee</i> with you, feeding themselves <i>nanti</i> fear: clouds they are <i>nanti</i> <i>aqua</i>, <i>lelled</i> about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, <i>nanti</i> fruit, twice <i>stiff</i>, plucked up by the roots;
    </li>
    <li>Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own <i>scharda</i>; wandering <i>twinkling fakements</i>, to whom is reserved the blackness of <i>munge</i> for ever.
    </li>
    <li>And Enoch also, the <i>setterth</i> from Adam, prophesied of these, <i>cackling</i>, <i>varda</i>, the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolleth</i> with <i>dacha</i> <i>milles</i> of <i>her</i> saints,
    </li>
    <li>To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly <i>kerterverers</i> have <i>cackled</i> against <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>These are murmurers, complainers, <i>mincing</i> after their own lusts; and their <i>screech</i> <i>cackleth</i> <i>dowry</i> swelling <i>lavs</i>, having <i>homies</i>&#8216;s persons in admiration because of advantage.
    </li>
    <li>But, beloved, remember ye the <i>lavs</i> which were <i>cackled</i> before of the apostles of our <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>;
    </li>
    <li>How that they <i>cackled</i> you there should be mockers in the last time, who should <i>mince</i> after their own ungodly lusts.
    </li>
    <li>These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the <i>Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most <i>fabulosa</i> faith, praying in the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Keep yourselves in the love of <i>Gloria</i>, looking for the mercy of our <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> unto eternal life.
    </li>
    <li>And of some have compassion, making a difference:
    </li>
    <li>And others save with fear, pulling them out of the <i>binco fakement</i>; hating even the <i>frock</i> spotted by the flesh.
    </li>
    <li>Now unto <i>her</i> that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of <i>her</i> <i>fabeness</i> with exceeding joy,
    </li>
    <li>To the only wise <i>Gloria</i> our Saviour, be <i>fabeness</i> and <i>fabularity</i>, dominion and power, both now and ever. <i>Larlou</i>.
    </li>
