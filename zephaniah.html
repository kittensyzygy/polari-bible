    <h1>Zephaniah</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>The <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> which <i>trolled</i> unto Zephaniah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Cushi, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Gedaliah, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Amariah, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Hizkiah, in the days of Josiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Amon, <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah.
    </li>
    <li>I will utterly consume all <i>fakements</i> from off the land, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I will consume <i>homie</i> and beast; I will consume the fowls of the heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumblingblocks with the <i>naff</i>: and I will cut off <i>homie</i> from off the land, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I will also stretch out mine <i>famble</i> upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, and the name of the Chemarims with the <i>godly homies</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and them that worship and that swear by the <i>Duchess</i>, and that swear by Malcham;
    </li>
    <li>And them that are turned back from the <i>Duchess</i>; and those that have not sought the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>nishta</i> enquired for <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Hold thy peace at the presence of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>: for the <i>journo</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> is at <i>famble</i>: for the <i>Duchess</i> hath prepared a <i>parker</i>, <i>she</i> hath bid <i>her</i> guests.
    </li>
    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass in the <i>journo</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s <i>parker</i>, that I will <i>zsa zsa</i> the <i>princesses</i>, and the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>chavvies</i>, and all such as are clothed with strange <i>schmutter</i>.
    </li>
    <li>In the same <i>journo</i> also will I <i>zsa zsa</i> all those that leap on the threshold, which fill their masters&#8217; <i>latties</i> with <i>slapping</i> and deceit.
    </li>
    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass in that <i>journo</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, that there shall be the <i>screech</i> of a <i>screech</i> from the fish gate, and an howling from the second, and a <i>dowry</i> crashing from the hills.
    </li>
    <li>Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the <i>bodega homie</i> <i>homies and palones</i> are cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off.
    </li>
    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with candles, and <i>zsa zsa</i> the <i>homies</i> that are settled on their lees: that <i>cackle</i> in their <i>thumping cheat</i>, The <i>Duchess</i> will not do <i>bona</i>, <i>nishta</i> will <i>she</i> do <i>nana</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their <i>latties</i> a desolation: they shall also build <i>latties</i>, but not inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, but not <i>buvare</i> the <i>sherry</i> thereof.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>dowry</i> <i>journo</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly, even the <i>cackling fakement</i> of the <i>journo</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>: the <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homie</i> shall <i>screech</i> there bitterly.
    </li>
    <li>That <i>journo</i> is a <i>journo</i> of wrath, a <i>journo</i> of trouble and distress, a <i>journo</i> of wasteness and desolation, a <i>journo</i> of <i>munge</i> and gloominess, a <i>journo</i> of clouds and thick <i>munge</i>,
    </li>
    <li>A <i>journo</i> of the <i>tooting fakement</i> and alarm against the fenced <i>smokes</i>, and against the high towers.
    </li>
    <li>And I will <i>parker</i> distress upon <i>homies</i>, that they shall <i>mince</i> like <i>nanti varda</i> <i>homies</i>, because they have <i>kertervered</i> against the <i>Duchess</i>: and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung.
    </li>
    <li><i>Nishta</i> their silver <i>nishta</i> their <i>gelt</i> shall be able to deliver them in the <i>journo</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the <i>binco fakement</i> of <i>her</i> jealousy: for <i>she</i> shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that <i>lett</i> in the land.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Gather yourselves together, <i>any road up</i>, gather together, O nation not <i>fancied</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Before the decree <i>parker</i> forth, before the <i>journo</i> pass as the chaff, before the fierce <i>wild</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>troll</i> upon you, before the <i>journo</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s <i>wild</i> <i>troll</i> upon you.
    </li>
    <li><i>Charper</i> ye the <i>Duchess</i>, all ye <i>camp</i> of the earth, which have wrought <i>her</i> judgment; <i>charper</i> <i>bonaness</i>, <i>charper</i> <i>campness</i>: it may be ye shall be hid in the <i>journo</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s <i>wild</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they shall drive out Ashdod at the noon <i>journo</i>, and Ekron shall be rooted up.
    </li>
    <li>Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites! the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> is against you; O Canaan, the land of the <i>naffs</i>, I will even <i>battyfang</i> thee, that there shall be no inhabitant.
    </li>
    <li>And the sea coast shall be dwellings and cottages for shepherds, and folds for flocks.
    </li>
    <li>And the coast shall be for the remnant of the <i>lattie</i> of Judah; they shall feed thereupon: in the <i>latties</i> of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the <i>bijou nochy</i>: for the <i>Duchess</i> their <i>Gloria</i> shall visit them, and turn away their captivity.
    </li>
    <li>I have <i>aunt nelled</i> the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my <i>homies and palones</i>, and magnified themselves against their border.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore as I live, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts, the <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon as Gomorrah, even the breeding of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my <i>homies and palones</i> shall spoil them, and the remnant of my <i>homies and palones</i> shall possess them.
    </li>
    <li>This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the <i>homies and palones</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> will be <i>nanna</i> unto them: for <i>she</i> will famish all the gods of the earth; and <i>homies</i> shall worship <i>her</i>, every <i>una</i> from <i>her</i> place, even all the isles of the heathen.
    </li>
    <li>Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be <i>ferricadoozed</i> by my <i>dowry efink</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> will stretch out <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> against the north, and <i>battyfang</i> Assyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry like a <i>nishta smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it; their <i>cackling fakement</i> shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds; for <i>she</i> shall uncover the cedar <i>acting dickey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>This is the rejoicing <i>smoke</i> that <i>letted</i> carelessly, that <i>cackled</i> in her <i>thumping cheat</i>, I am, and there is none beside me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every <i>una</i> that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Woe to her that is <i>manky</i> and <i>dingy</i>, to the oppressing <i>smoke</i>!
    </li>
    <li>She obeyed not the <i>cackling fakement</i>; she <i>lalled</i> not correction; she trusted not in the <i>Duchess</i>; she drew not near to her <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Her <i>princesses</i> within her are <i>butch shrieking</i> lions; her <i>beaks</i> are <i>bijou nochy</i> wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.
    </li>
    <li>Her prophets are <i>sparkle</i> and treacherous persons: her <i>godly homies</i> have <i>dingy</i> the sanctuary, they have done <i>slapping</i> to the law.
    </li>
    <li>The just <i>Duchess</i> is in the midst thereof; <i>she</i> will not do <i>codness</i>: every morning doth <i>she</i> <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> judgment to <i>sparkle</i>, <i>she</i> faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no <i>scharda</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passeth by: their <i>smokes</i> are <i>battyfanged</i>, so that there is no <i>homie</i>, that there is none inhabitant.
    </li>
    <li>I <i>cackled</i>, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt <i>lall</i> instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I <i>zsa zsa-ed</i> them: but they rose early, and corrupted all their doings.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore wait ye upon me, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, until the <i>journo</i> that I rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce <i>wild</i>: for all the earth shall be devoured with the <i>binco fakement</i> of my jealousy.
    </li>
    <li>For then will I turn to the <i>homies and palones</i> a pure language, that they may all <i>screech</i> upon the name of the <i>Duchess</i>, to serve <i>her</i> with <i>una</i> consent.
    </li>
    <li>From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the <i>palone chavvie</i> of my dispersed, shall <i>parker</i> mine <i>parkering</i>.
    </li>
    <li>In that <i>journo</i> shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will <i>lell</i> away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt <i>nishta</i> be haughty because of my <i>fabulosa</i> mountain.
    </li>
    <li>I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and <i>nanti dinarly</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, and they shall trust in the name of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The remnant of Israel shall not do <i>codness</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>cackle</i> lies; <i>nishta</i> shall a deceitful <i>polari</i> be found in their <i>screech</i>: for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.
    </li>
    <li>Sing, O <i>palone chavvie</i> of Zion; <i>screech</i>, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the <i>thumping cheat</i>, O <i>palone chavvie</i> of Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>lelled</i> away thy judgments, <i>she</i> hath cast out thine enemy: the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel, even the <i>Duchess</i>, is in the midst of thee: <i>nishta</i> <i>varda</i> <i>nana</i> any more.
    </li>
    <li>In that <i>journo</i> it shall be <i>cackled</i> to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and to Zion, Let not thine <i>fambles</i> be slack.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> in the midst of thee is <i>dowry butch</i>; <i>she</i> will save, <i>she</i> will rejoice over thee with joy; <i>she</i> will <i>lettie</i> in <i>her</i> love, <i>she</i> will joy over thee with singing.
    </li>
    <li>I will gather them that are <i>shardaful</i> for the solemn assembly, who are of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a burden.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to <i>scharda</i>.
    </li>
    <li>At that time will I <i>parker</i> you again, even in the time that I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all <i>homies and palones</i> of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your <i>ogles</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
