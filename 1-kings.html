    <h1>1 Kings</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>Davina</i> was <i>badge</i> and stricken in years; and they covered <i>her</i> with <i>zhoosh</i>, but <i>she</i> gat no heat.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Let there be sought for my <i>Duchess</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> a <i>bean</i> <i>nanti charver</i>: and let her stand before the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and let her cherish <i>her</i>, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my <i>Duchess</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> may get heat.
    </li>
    <li>So they sought for a <i>filly</i> damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the damsel was <i>dowry</i> <i>filly</i>, and cherished the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and ministered to <i>her</i>: but the <i>dowriest homie</i> knew her not.
    </li>
    <li>Then Adonijah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Haggith exalted himself, <i>cackling</i>, I will be <i>dowriest homie</i>: and <i>she</i> prepared <i>her</i> <i>rattling coves</i> and horsemen, and <i>chinker dacha</i> <i>homies</i> to run before <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> had not displeased <i>her</i> at any time in <i>cackling</i>, Why hast thou done so? and <i>she</i> also was a <i>dowry</i> goodly <i>homie</i>; and <i>her</i> mother bare <i>her</i> after Absalom.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> conferred with Joab the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the <i>godly homie</i>: and they following Adonijah helped <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But Zadok the <i>godly homie</i>, and Benaiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i> which belonged to <i>Davina</i>, were not with Adonijah.
    </li>
    <li>And Adonijah <i>ferricadoozaed</i> sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and <i>screeched</i> all <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>homie chavvies</i>, and all the <i>homies</i> of Judah the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>serving homies</i>:
    </li>
    <li>But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i>, and Solomon <i>her</i> <i>sister</i>, <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> not.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore Nathan <i>cackled</i> unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, <i>cackling</i>, Hast thou not <i>aunt nelled</i> that Adonijah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Haggith doth reign, and <i>Davina</i> our <i>Duchess</i> knoweth it not?
    </li>
    <li>Now therefore <i>troll</i>, let me, I pray thee, <i>parker</i> thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy <i>homie chavvie</i> Solomon.
    </li>
    <li><i>Troll</i> and get thee in unto <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>Davina</i>, and <i>cackle</i> unto <i>her</i>, Didst not thou, my <i>Duchess</i>, O <i>dowriest homie</i>, swear unto thine <i>famble palone</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Assuredly Solomon thy <i>homie chavvie</i> shall reign after me, and <i>she</i> shall <i>lett</i> upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, while thou yet talkest there with the <i>dowriest homie</i>, I also will <i>troll</i> in after thee, and confirm thy <i>lavs</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Bathsheba <i>trolled</i> in unto the <i>dowriest homie</i> into the <i>booth</i>: and the <i>dowriest homie</i> was <i>dowry</i> <i>badge</i>; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>. And the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i>, What wouldest thou?
    </li>
    <li>And she <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, My <i>Duchess</i>, thou swarest by the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> unto thine <i>famble palone</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Assuredly Solomon thy <i>homie chavvie</i> shall reign after me, and <i>she</i> shall <i>lett</i> upon my throne.
    </li>
    <li>And now, <i>varda</i>, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my <i>Duchess</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>, thou knowest it not:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> hath <i>ferricadoozed</i> oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath <i>screeched</i> all the <i>homie chavvies</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and Abiathar the <i>godly homie</i>, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy <i>serving homie</i> hath <i>she</i> not <i>screeched</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And thou, my <i>Duchess</i>, O <i>dowriest homie</i>, the <i>ogles</i> of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest <i>cackle</i> them who shall <i>lett</i> on the throne of my <i>Duchess</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> after <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Otherwise it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, when my <i>Duchess</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> shall <i>letty</i> with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>, that I and my <i>homie chavvie</i> Solomon shall be counted offenders.
    </li>
    <li>And, lo, while she yet talked with the <i>dowriest homie</i>, Nathan the prophet also <i>trolled</i> in.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>cackled</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>varda</i> Nathan the prophet. And when <i>she</i> was <i>troll</i> in before the <i>dowriest homie</i>, <i>she</i> bowed himself before the <i>dowriest homie</i> with <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> to the ground.
    </li>
    <li>And Nathan <i>cackled</i>, My <i>Duchess</i>, O <i>dowriest homie</i>, hast thou <i>cackled</i>, Adonijah shall reign after me, and <i>she</i> shall <i>lett</i> upon my throne?
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> is <i>trolled</i> down this <i>journo</i>, and hath <i>ferricadoozed</i> oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath <i>screeched</i> all the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>homie chavvies</i>, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the <i>godly homie</i>; and, <i>varda</i>, they <i>jarry</i> and <i>buvare</i> before <i>her</i>, and <i>cackle</i>, <i>Gloria</i> save <i>dowriest homie</i> Adonijah.
    </li>
    <li>But me, even me thy <i>serving homie</i>, and Zadok the <i>godly homie</i>, and Benaiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jehoiada, and thy <i>serving homie</i> Solomon, hath <i>she</i> not <i>screeched</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Is this <i>fakement</i> done by my <i>Duchess</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and thou hast not shewed it unto thy <i>serving homie</i>, who should <i>lett</i> on the throne of my <i>Duchess</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> after <i>her</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>Davina</i> answered and <i>cackled</i>, <i>screech</i> me Bathsheba. And she <i>trolled</i> into the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s presence, and stood before the <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> sware, and <i>cackled</i>, As the <i>Duchess</i> <i>letteth</i>, that hath redeemed my <i>nishta lucoddy</i> out of all distress,
    </li>
    <li>Even as I sware unto thee by the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, <i>cackling</i>, Assuredly Solomon thy <i>homie chavvie</i> shall reign after me, and <i>she</i> shall <i>lett</i> upon my throne in my stead; even so will I <i>mais oui</i> do this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then Bathsheba bowed with her <i>eke</i> to the earth, and did reverence to the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Let my <i>Duchess</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>Davina</i> live for ever.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>Davina</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>screech</i> me Zadok the <i>godly homie</i>, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jehoiada. And they <i>trolled</i> before the <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>dowriest homie</i> also <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>lell</i> with you the <i>serving homies</i> of your <i>Duchess</i>, and cause Solomon my <i>homie chavvie</i> to ride upon mine own mule, and <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> down to Gihon:
    </li>
    <li>And let Zadok the <i>godly homie</i> and Nathan the prophet anoint <i>her</i> there <i>dowriest homie</i> over Israel: and blow ye with the <i>tooting fakement</i>, and <i>cackle</i>, <i>Gloria</i> save <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon.
    </li>
    <li>Then ye shall <i>troll</i> up after <i>her</i>, that <i>she</i> may <i>troll</i> and <i>lett</i> upon my throne; for <i>she</i> shall be <i>dowriest homie</i> in my stead: and I have appointed <i>her</i> to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.
    </li>
    <li>And Benaiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jehoiada answered the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>Larlou</i>: the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of my <i>Duchess</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackle</i> so too.
    </li>
    <li>As the <i>Duchess</i> hath been with my <i>Duchess</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>, even so be <i>she</i> with Solomon, and make <i>her</i> throne <i>dowrier</i> than the throne of my <i>Duchess</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>Davina</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So Zadok the <i>godly homie</i>, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, <i>trolled</i> down, and caused Solomon to ride upon <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>Davina</i>&#8216;s mule, and brought <i>her</i> to Gihon.
    </li>
    <li>And Zadok the <i>godly homie</i> <i>lelled</i> an <i>colin</i> of <i>lube</i> out of the <i>bijou tabernaclette</i>, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the <i>tooting fakement</i>; and all the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>Gloria</i> save <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon.
    </li>
    <li>And all the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>trolled</i> up after <i>her</i>, and the <i>homies and palones</i> piped with pipes, and rejoiced with <i>dowry</i> joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.
    </li>
    <li>And Adonijah and all the guests that were with <i>her</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab <i>aunt nelled</i> the sound of the <i>tooting fakement</i>, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Wherefore is this <i>screech</i> of the <i>smoke</i> being in an uproar?
    </li>
    <li>And while <i>she</i> yet <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, Jonathan the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Abiathar the <i>godly homie</i> <i>trolled</i>; and Adonijah <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>troll</i> in; for thou art a valiant <i>homie</i>, and bringest <i>bona</i> tidings.
    </li>
    <li>And Jonathan answered and <i>cackled</i> to Adonijah, Verily our <i>Duchess</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>Davina</i> hath made Solomon <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> hath <i>laued</i> with <i>her</i> Zadok the <i>godly homie</i>, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused <i>her</i> to ride upon the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s mule:
    </li>
    <li>And Zadok the <i>godly homie</i> and Nathan the prophet have anointed <i>her</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> in Gihon: and they are <i>troll</i> up from thence rejoicing, so that the <i>smoke</i> rang again. This is the <i>screech</i> that ye have <i>aunt nelled</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.
    </li>
    <li>And moreover the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>serving homies</i> <i>trolled</i> to bless our <i>Duchess</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>Davina</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>Gloria</i> make the name of Solomon <i>benar</i> than thy name, and make <i>her</i> throne <i>dowrier</i> than thy throne. And the <i>dowriest homie</i> bowed himself upon the bed.
    </li>
    <li>And also thus <i>cackled</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>, <i>fabed</i> be the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, which hath <i>parkered</i> <i>una</i> to <i>lett</i> on my throne this <i>journo</i>, mine <i>ogles</i> even <i>vardaing</i> it.
    </li>
    <li>And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and <i>trolled</i> every <i>homie</i> <i>her</i> way.
    </li>
    <li>And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and <i>trolled</i>, and caught hold on the <i>colins</i> of the <i>grovelling fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And it was <i>cackled</i> Solomon, <i>cackling</i>, <i>varda</i>, Adonijah feareth <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon: for, lo, <i>she</i> hath caught hold on the <i>colins</i> of the <i>grovelling fakement</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Let <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon swear unto me today that <i>she</i> will not <i>ferricadooza</i> <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i> with the <i>dowry efink</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Solomon <i>cackled</i>, If <i>she</i> will shew himself a <i>bona</i> <i>homie</i>, there shall not an <i>riah</i> of <i>her</i> fall to the earth: but if <i>naffness</i> shall be found in <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> shall <i>cark it</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon <i>laued</i>, and they brought <i>her</i> down from the <i>grovelling fakement</i>. And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> and bowed himself to <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon: and Solomon <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>troll</i> to thine <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now the days of <i>Davina</i> drew <i>ajax</i> that <i>she</i> should <i>cark it</i>; and <i>she</i> charged Solomon <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>I <i>troll</i> the way of all the earth: be thou <i>butch</i> therefore, and shew thyself a <i>homie</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And keep the charge of the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i>, to <i>mince</i> in <i>her</i> ways, to keep <i>her</i> <i>dowry lavs</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>butch lavs</i>, and <i>her</i> judgments, and <i>her</i> testimonies, as it is <i>screeved</i> in the law of <i>Maureen</i>, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:
    </li>
    <li>That the <i>Duchess</i> may continue <i>her</i> <i>lav</i> which <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> concerning me, <i>cackling</i>, If thy <i>chavvies</i> <i>lell</i> heed to their way, to <i>mince</i> before me <i>no flies</i> with all their <i>thumping cheat</i> and with all their <i>nishta lucoddy</i>, there shall not fail thee (<i>cackled</i> <i>she</i>) a <i>homie</i> on the throne of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Zeruiah did to me, and what <i>she</i> did to the <i>dewey</i> captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ner, and unto Amasa the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jether, whom <i>she</i> <i>ferricadoozaed</i>, and shed the blood of <i>barney</i> in peace, and put the blood of <i>barney</i> upon <i>her</i> girdle that was about <i>her</i> loins, and in <i>her</i> <i>slingbacks</i> that were on <i>her</i> <i>plates</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not <i>her</i> hoar <i>eke</i> <i>troll</i> down to the grave in peace.
    </li>
    <li>But shew kindness unto the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that <i>jarry</i> at thy table: for so they <i>trolled</i> to me when I fled because of Absalom thy <i>sister</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, thou hast with thee Shimei the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a <i>naff</i> curse in the <i>journo</i> when I <i>trolled</i> to Mahanaim: but <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to <i>her</i> by the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>cackling</i>, I will not put thee to <i>carking it</i> with the <i>dowry efink</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now therefore hold <i>her</i> not guiltless: for thou art a wise <i>homie</i>, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto <i>her</i>; but <i>her</i> hoar <i>eke</i> <i>parker</i> thou down to the grave with blood.
    </li>
    <li>So <i>Davina</i> <i>lettied</i> with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>, and was buried in the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the days that <i>Davina</i> reigned over Israel were <i>quarter dacha</i> years: <i>setter</i> years reigned <i>she</i> in Hebron, and <i>trey dacha</i> and <i>trey</i> years reigned <i>she</i> in Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>Then sat Solomon upon the throne of <i>Davina</i> <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>; and <i>her</i> kingdom was established greatly.
    </li>
    <li>And Adonijah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Haggith <i>trolled</i> to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she <i>cackled</i>, Comest thou peaceably? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Peaceably.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> <i>cackled</i> moreover, I have somewhat to <i>cackle</i> unto thee. And she <i>cackled</i>, <i>cackle</i> on.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their <i>ekes</i> on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my <i>sister</i>&#8216;s: for it was <i>her</i> from the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And now I ask <i>una</i> petition of thee, deny me not. And she <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>cackle</i> on.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>cackle</i>, I pray thee, unto Solomon the <i>dowriest homie</i>, (for <i>she</i> will not <i>cackle</i> thee nay,) that <i>she</i> <i>parker</i> me Abishag the Shunammite to <i>palone affair</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Bathsheba <i>cackled</i>, Well; I will <i>cackle</i> for thee unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Bathsheba therefore <i>trolled</i> unto <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon, to <i>cackle</i> unto <i>her</i> for Adonijah. And the <i>dowriest homie</i> rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on <i>her</i> throne, and caused a seat to be set for the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s mother; and she sat on <i>her</i> <i>sweet martini</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then she <i>cackled</i>, I <i>fancy</i> <i>una</i> <i>pogey</i> petition of thee; I pray thee, <i>cackle</i> me not nay. And the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not <i>cackle</i> thee nay.
    </li>
    <li>And she <i>cackled</i>, Let Abishag the Shunammite be <i>parkered</i> to Adonijah thy <i>sister</i> to <i>palone affair</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon answered and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for <i>her</i> the kingdom also; for <i>she</i> is mine elder <i>sister</i>; even for <i>her</i>, and for Abiathar the <i>godly homie</i>, and for Joab the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Zeruiah.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon sware by the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>Gloria</i> do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not <i>cackled</i> this <i>lav</i> against <i>her</i> own life.
    </li>
    <li>Now therefore, as the <i>Duchess</i> <i>letteth</i>, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of <i>Davina</i> my <i>Auntie</i>, and who hath made me an <i>lattie</i>, as <i>she</i> promised, Adonijah shall be put to <i>carking it</i> this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon <i>laued</i> by the <i>famble</i> of Benaiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jehoiada; and <i>she</i> fell upon <i>her</i> that <i>she</i> <i>carked it</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And unto Abiathar the <i>godly homie</i> <i>cackled</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art <i>bona</i> of <i>carking it</i>: but I will not at this time put thee to <i>carking it</i>, because thou barest the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> before <i>Davina</i> my <i>Auntie</i>, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my <i>Auntie</i> was afflicted.
    </li>
    <li>So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being <i>godly homie</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>; that <i>she</i> might fulfil the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, which <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> concerning the <i>lattie</i> of Eli in Shiloh.
    </li>
    <li>Then tidings <i>trolled</i> to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though <i>she</i> turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the <i>bijou tabernaclette</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and caught hold on the <i>colins</i> of the <i>grovelling fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And it was <i>cackled</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon that Joab was fled unto the <i>bijou tabernaclette</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>; and, <i>varda</i>, <i>she</i> is by the <i>grovelling fakement</i>. Then Solomon <i>laued</i> Benaiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jehoiada, <i>cackling</i>, <i>troll</i>, fall upon <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Benaiah <i>trolled</i> to the <i>bijou tabernaclette</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>, <i>troll</i> forth. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Nay; but I will <i>cark it</i> here. And Benaiah brought the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>lav</i> again, <i>cackling</i>, Thus <i>cackled</i> Joab, and thus <i>she</i> answered me.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Do as <i>she</i> hath <i>cackled</i>, and fall upon <i>her</i>, and bury <i>her</i>; that thou mayest <i>lell</i> away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the <i>lattie</i> of my <i>Auntie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> shall return <i>her</i> blood upon <i>her</i> own <i>eke</i>, who fell upon <i>dewey</i> <i>homies</i> more <i>bona</i> and <i>benar</i> than <i>she</i>, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> them with the <i>dowry efink</i>, my <i>Auntie</i> <i>Davina</i> not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.
    </li>
    <li>Their blood shall therefore return upon the <i>eke</i> of Joab, and upon the <i>eke</i> of <i>her</i> <i>maria</i> for ever: but upon <i>Davina</i>, and upon <i>her</i> <i>maria</i>, and upon <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>, and upon <i>her</i> throne, shall there be peace for ever from the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So Benaiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jehoiada <i>trolled</i> up, and fell upon <i>her</i>, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> <i>her</i>: and <i>she</i> was buried in <i>her</i> own <i>lattie</i> in the <i>nishta smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> put Benaiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jehoiada in <i>her</i> room over the host: and Zadok the <i>godly homie</i> did the <i>dowriest homie</i> put in the room of Abiathar.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>laued</i> and <i>screeched</i> for Shimei, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Build thee an <i>lattie</i> in Jerusalem, and <i>lett</i> there, and <i>troll not</i> forth thence any whither.
    </li>
    <li>For it shall be, that on the <i>journo</i> thou <i>trollest</i> out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely <i>cark it</i>: thy blood shall be upon thine own <i>eke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Shimei <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>, The <i>cackling</i> is <i>bona</i>: as my <i>Duchess</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> hath <i>cackled</i>, so will thy <i>serving homie</i> do. And Shimei <i>letted</i> in Jerusalem many days.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> at the end of <i>trey</i> years, that <i>dewey</i> of the <i>serving homies</i> of Shimei ran away unto Achish <i>homie chavvie</i> of Maachah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Gath. And they <i>cackled</i> Shimei, <i>cackling</i>, <i>varda</i>, thy <i>serving homies</i> be in Gath.
    </li>
    <li>And Shimei arose, and saddled <i>her</i> ass, and <i>trolled</i> to Gath to Achish to <i>charper</i> <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>: and Shimei <i>trolled</i>, and brought <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i> from Gath.
    </li>
    <li>And it was <i>cackled</i> Solomon that Shimei had <i>trolled</i> from Jerusalem to Gath, and was <i>troll</i> again.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>laued</i> and <i>screeched</i> for Shimei, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Did I not make thee to swear by the <i>Duchess</i>, and protested unto thee, <i>cackling</i>, Know for a certain, on the <i>journo</i> thou <i>trollest</i> out, and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely <i>cark it</i>? and thou saidst unto me, The <i>lav</i> that I have <i>aunt nelled</i> is <i>bona</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the <i>Duchess</i>, and the <i>butch lav</i> that I have charged thee with?
    </li>
    <li>The <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i> moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the <i>naffness</i> which thine <i>thumping cheat</i> is privy to, that thou didst to <i>Davina</i> my <i>Auntie</i>: therefore the <i>Duchess</i> shall return thy <i>naffness</i> upon thine own <i>eke</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon shall be <i>fabed</i>, and the throne of <i>Davina</i> shall be established before the <i>Duchess</i> for ever.
    </li>
    <li>So the <i>dowriest homie</i> commanded Benaiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jehoiada; which <i>trolled</i> out, and fell upon <i>her</i>, that <i>she</i> <i>carked it</i>. And the kingdom was established in the <i>famble</i> of Solomon.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh <i>dowriest homie</i> of Egypt, and <i>lelled</i> Pharaoh&#8217;s <i>palone chavvie</i>, and brought her into the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i>, until <i>she</i> had made an end of building <i>her</i> own <i>lattie</i>, and the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.
    </li>
    <li>Only the <i>homies and palones</i> sacrificed in high places, because there was no <i>lattie</i> built unto the name of the <i>Duchess</i>, until those days.
    </li>
    <li>And Solomon loved the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>mincing</i> in the <i>dowry lavs</i> of <i>Davina</i> <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>: only <i>she</i> sacrificed and burnt <i>smelly</i> in high places.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>trolled</i> to Gibeon to <i>parker</i> there; for that was the <i>dowry</i> high place: a <i>mille</i> burnt <i>parkerings</i> did Solomon offer upon that <i>grovelling fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>In Gibeon the <i>Duchess</i> appeared to Solomon in a dream by <i>nochy</i>: and <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i>, Ask what I shall <i>parker</i> thee.
    </li>
    <li>And Solomon <i>cackled</i>, Thou hast shewed unto thy <i>serving homie</i> <i>Davina</i> my <i>Auntie</i> <i>dowry</i> mercy, according as <i>she</i> <i>minced</i> before thee <i>no flies</i>, and in <i>bonaness</i>, and in uprightness of <i>thumping cheat</i> with thee; and thou hast kept for <i>her</i> this <i>dowry</i> kindness, that thou hast <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> a <i>homie chavvie</i> to <i>lett</i> on <i>her</i> throne, as it is this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And now, O <i>Duchess</i> my <i>Gloria</i>, thou hast made thy <i>serving homie</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> instead of <i>Davina</i> my <i>Auntie</i>: and I am but a <i>bijou</i> <i>chavvie</i>: I know not how to <i>troll out</i> or <i>troll</i> in.
    </li>
    <li>And thy <i>serving homie</i> is in the midst of thy <i>homies and palones</i> which thou hast chosen, a <i>dowry</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, that cannot be numbered <i>nishta</i> counted for multitude.
    </li>
    <li><i>Parker</i> therefore thy <i>serving homie</i> an understanding <i>thumping cheat</i> to <i>beak</i> thy <i>homies and palones</i>, that I may discern between <i>bona</i> and <i>cod</i>: for who is able to <i>beak</i> this thy so <i>dowry</i> a <i>homies and palones</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>cackle</i> pleased the <i>Duchess</i>, that Solomon had asked this <i>fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Because thou hast asked this <i>fakement</i>, and hast not asked for thyself long life; <i>nishta</i> hast asked riches for thyself, <i>nishta</i> hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, I have done according to thy <i>lavs</i>: lo, I have <i>parkered</i> thee a wise and an understanding <i>thumping cheat</i>; so that there was none like thee before thee, <i>nishta</i> after thee shall any arise like unto thee.
    </li>
    <li>And I have also <i>parkered</i> thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the <i>dowriest homies</i> like unto thee all thy days.
    </li>
    <li>And if thou wilt <i>mince</i> in my ways, to keep my <i>dowry lavs</i> and my <i>butch lavs</i>, as thy <i>Auntie</i> <i>Davina</i> did <i>mince</i>, then I will lengthen thy days.
    </li>
    <li>And Solomon awoke; and, <i>varda</i>, it was a dream. And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> to Jerusalem, and stood before the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the covenant of the <i>Duchess</i>, and offered up burnt <i>parkerings</i>, and offered peace <i>parkerings</i>, and made a <i>dowry munjarlee</i> to all <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>trolled</i> there <i>dewey</i> <i>palones</i>, that were <i>charvering donnas</i>, unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and stood before <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>una</i> <i>palone</i> <i>cackled</i>, O my <i>Duchess</i>, I and this <i>palone</i> <i>lett</i> in <i>una</i> <i>lattie</i>; and I was <i>laued</i> of a <i>chavvie</i> with her in the <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> the third <i>journo</i> after that I was <i>laued</i>, that this <i>palone</i> was <i>laued</i> also: and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the <i>lattie</i>, save we <i>dewey</i> in the <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And this <i>palone</i>&#8216;s <i>chavvie</i> <i>carked it</i> in the <i>nochy</i>; because she overlaid it.
    </li>
    <li>And she arose at midnight, and <i>lelled</i> my <i>homie chavvie</i> from beside me, while thine <i>famble palone</i> <i>lettied</i>, and <i>laued</i> it in her bosom, and <i>laued</i> her <i>stiff</i> <i>chavvie</i> in my bosom.
    </li>
    <li>And when I rose in the morning to <i>parker</i> my <i>chavvie</i> suck, <i>varda</i>, it was <i>stiff</i>: but when I had considered it in the morning, <i>varda</i>, it was not my <i>homie chavvie</i>, which I did bear.
    </li>
    <li>And the other <i>palone</i> <i>cackled</i>, Nay; but the living is my <i>homie chavvie</i>, and the <i>stiff</i> is thy <i>homie chavvie</i>. And this <i>cackled</i>, No; but the <i>stiff</i> is thy <i>homie chavvie</i>, and the living is my <i>homie chavvie</i>. Thus they <i>cackled</i> before the <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>, The <i>una</i> <i>cackleth</i>, This is my <i>homie chavvie</i> that <i>letteth</i>, and thy <i>homie chavvie</i> is the <i>stiff</i>: and the other <i>cackleth</i>, Nay; but thy <i>homie chavvie</i> is the <i>stiff</i>, and my <i>homie chavvie</i> is the living.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>parker</i> me a <i>dowry efink</i>. And they brought a <i>dowry efink</i> before the <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i>, Divide the living <i>chavvie</i> in <i>dewey</i>, and <i>parker</i> half to the <i>una</i>, and half to the other.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> the <i>palone</i> whose the living <i>chavvie</i> was unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>, for her <i>chutney locker</i> yearned upon her <i>homie chavvie</i>, and she <i>cackled</i>, O my <i>Duchess</i>, <i>parker</i> her the living <i>chavvie</i>, and in no wise <i>ferricadooza</i> it. But the other <i>cackled</i>, Let it be <i>nishta</i> mine <i>nishta</i> thine, but divide it.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>dowriest homie</i> answered and <i>cackled</i>, <i>parker</i> her the living <i>chavvie</i>, and in no wise <i>ferricadooza</i> it: she is the mother thereof.
    </li>
    <li>And all Israel <i>aunt nelled</i> of the judgment which the <i>dowriest homie</i> had judged; and they feared the <i>dowriest homie</i>: for they <i>vardad</i> that the wisdom of <i>Gloria</i> was in <i>her</i>, to do judgment.

    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>

    <li>So <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon was <i>dowriest homie</i> over all Israel.

    <li>And Ahishar was over the household: and Adoniram the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Abda was over the tribute.
    </li>
    <li>And Solomon had <i>kenza</i> <i>hilda handcuffs</i> over all Israel, which provided victuals for the <i>dowriest homie</i> and <i>her</i> household: each <i>homie</i> <i>her</i> month in a year made provision.
    </li>
    <li>And these are their names: The <i>homie chavvie</i> of Hur, in mount Ephraim:

    <li>The <i>homie chavvie</i> of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Bethshemesh, and Elonbethhanan:

    <li>Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and <i>bevvying</i>, and making merry.

    <li>And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the <i>naffs</i>, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of <i>her</i> life.
    </li>
    <li>And Solomon&#8217;s provision for <i>una</i> <i>journo</i> was <i>trey dacha</i> measures of <i>bona</i> flour, and <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> measures of meal,

    <li><i>Dacha</i> fat oxen, and <i>dewey dacha</i> oxen out of the pastures, and an <i>chenter</i> sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl.

    <li>For <i>she</i> had dominion over all the region on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the <i>dowriest homies</i> on this side the river: and <i>she</i> had peace on all sides round about <i>her</i>.

    <li>And Judah and Israel <i>letted</i> safely, every <i>homie</i> under <i>her</i> vine and under <i>her</i> fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.

    <li>And Solomon had <i>quarter dacha</i> <i>mille</i> stalls of horses for <i>her</i> <i>rattling coves</i>, and <i>kenza</i> <i>mille</i> horsemen.
    </li>
    <li>And those <i>hilda handcuffs</i> provided victual for <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon, and for all that <i>trolled</i> unto <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon&#8217;s table, every <i>homie</i> in <i>her</i> month: they lacked <i>nishter</i>.

    <li>Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where the <i>hilda handcuffs</i> were, every <i>homie</i> according to <i>her</i> charge.

    <li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>parkered</i> Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding <i>dowry</i>, and largeness of <i>thumping cheat</i>, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.

    <li>And Solomon&#8217;s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the <i>chavvies</i> of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> was wiser than all <i>homies</i>; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Mahol: and <i>her</i> fame was in all nations round about.

    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> <i>trey</i> <i>mille</i> proverbs: and <i>her</i> <i>chants</i> were a <i>mille</i> and <i>chinker</i>.

    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping <i>fakements</i>, and of fishes.
    </li>
    <li>And there <i>trolled</i> of all <i>homies and palones</i> to <i>aunt nell</i> the wisdom of Solomon, from all <i>dowriest homies</i> of the earth, which had <i>aunt nelled</i> of <i>her</i> wisdom.

    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And Hiram <i>dowriest homie</i> of Tyre <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i> unto Solomon; for <i>she</i> had <i>aunt nelled</i> that they had anointed <i>her</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> in the room of <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>: for Hiram was ever a <i>affair</i> of <i>Davina</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Solomon <i>laued</i> to Hiram, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Thou knowest how that <i>Davina</i> my <i>Auntie</i> could not build an <i>lattie</i> unto the name of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i> for the wars which were about <i>her</i> on every side, until the <i>Duchess</i> put them under the soles of <i>her</i> <i>plates</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But now the <i>Duchess</i> my <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>parkered</i> me <i>lettie</i> on every side, so that there is <i>nishta</i> adversary <i>nishta</i> <i>nana</i> occurrent.
    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, I purpose to build an <i>lattie</i> unto the name of the <i>Duchess</i> my <i>Gloria</i>, as the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Davina</i> my <i>Auntie</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Thy <i>homie chavvie</i>, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, <i>she</i> shall build an <i>lattie</i> unto my name.
    </li>
    <li>Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my <i>serving homies</i> shall be with thy <i>serving homies</i>: and unto thee will I <i>parker</i> hire for thy <i>serving homies</i> according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when Hiram <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>lavs</i> of Solomon, that <i>she</i> rejoiced greatly, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>fabed</i> be the <i>Duchess</i> this <i>journo</i>, which hath <i>parkered</i> unto <i>Davina</i> a wise <i>homie chavvie</i> over this <i>dowry</i> <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Hiram <i>laued</i> to Solomon, <i>cackling</i>, I have considered the <i>fakements</i> which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy <i>fancy</i> concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.
    </li>
    <li>My <i>serving homies</i> shall <i>parker</i> them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt <i>lall</i> them: and thou shalt accomplish my <i>fancy</i>, in giving <i>manjarry</i> for my household.
    </li>
    <li>So Hiram <i>parkered</i> Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all <i>her</i> <i>fancy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Solomon <i>parkered</i> Hiram <i>dewey dacha</i> <i>mille</i> measures of wheat for <i>manjarry</i> to <i>her</i> household, and <i>dewey dacha</i> measures of pure <i>lube</i>: thus <i>parkered</i> Solomon to Hiram year by year.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>parkered</i> Solomon wisdom, as <i>she</i> promised <i>her</i>: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they <i>dewey</i> made a league together.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was <i>trey dacha</i> <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> them to Lebanon, <i>dacha</i> <i>mille</i> a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and <i>dewey</i> months at home: and Adoniram was over the levy.
    </li>
    <li>And Solomon had <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> and <i>dacha</i> <i>mille</i> that bare burdens, and fourscore <i>mille</i> hewers in the mountains;
    </li>
    <li>Beside the <i>dowriest</i> of Solomon&#8217;s <i>hilda handcuffs</i> which were over the <i>acting dickey</i>, <i>trey</i> <i>mille</i> and <i>trey</i> <i>chenter</i>, which ruled over the <i>homies and palones</i> that wrought in the <i>acting dickey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> commanded, and they brought <i>dowry</i> stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to <i>lett</i> the foundation of the <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Solomon&#8217;s builders and Hiram&#8217;s builders did hew them, and the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the <i>lattie</i>.

    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> in the <i>quarter</i> <i>chenter</i> and eightieth year after the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel were <i>troll</i> out of the land of Egypt, in the <i>quarter</i> year of Solomon&#8217;s reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that <i>she</i> began to build the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>lattie</i> which <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon built for the <i>Duchess</i>, the length thereof was <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> cubits, and the breadth thereof <i>dewey dacha</i> cubits, and the height thereof <i>trey dacha</i> cubits.
    </li>
    <li>And the porch before the <i>holy carsey</i> of the <i>lattie</i>, <i>dewey dacha</i> cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the <i>lattie</i>; and <i>dacha</i> cubits was the breadth thereof before the <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And for the <i>lattie</i> <i>she</i> made windows of narrow <i>sparkles</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And against the wall of the <i>lattie</i> <i>she</i> built chambers round about, against the walls of the <i>lattie</i> round about, both of the <i>holy carsey</i> and of the oracle: and <i>she</i> made chambers round about:
    </li>
    <li>The nethermost <i>booth</i> was <i>chinker</i> cubits broad, and the middle was <i>sey</i> cubits broad, and the third was <i>setter</i> cubits broad: for <i>nanti</i> in the wall of the <i>lattie</i> <i>she</i> made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>lattie</i>, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was <i>nishta</i> hammer <i>nishta</i> axe <i>nishta</i> any tool of iron <i>aunt nelled</i> in the <i>lattie</i>, while it was in building.
    </li>
    <li>The door for the middle <i>booth</i> was in the <i>sweet</i> side of the <i>lattie</i>: and they <i>trolled</i> up with winding stairs into the middle <i>booth</i>, and out of the middle into the third.
    </li>
    <li>So <i>she</i> built the <i>lattie</i>, and finished it; and covered the <i>lattie</i> with beams and boards of cedar.
    </li>
    <li>And then <i>she</i> built chambers against all the <i>lattie</i>, <i>chinker</i> cubits high: and they rested on the <i>lattie</i> with timber of cedar.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> to Solomon, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Concerning this <i>lattie</i> which thou art in building, if thou wilt <i>mince</i> in my <i>dowry lavs</i>, and execute my judgments, and keep all my <i>butch lavs</i> to <i>mince</i> in them; then will I perform my <i>lav</i> with thee, which I <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Davina</i> thy <i>Auntie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And I will <i>lett</i> among the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, and will not forsake my <i>homies and palones</i> Israel.
    </li>
    <li>So Solomon built the <i>lattie</i>, and finished it.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> built the walls of the <i>lattie</i> within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the <i>lattie</i>, and the walls of the ceiling: and <i>she</i> covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the <i>lattie</i> with planks of fir.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> built <i>dewey dacha</i> cubits on the sides of the <i>lattie</i>, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: <i>she</i> even built them for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most <i>fabulosa</i> place.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>lattie</i>, that is, the <i>holy carsey</i> before it, was <i>quarter dacha</i> cubits long.
    </li>
    <li>And the cedar of the <i>lattie</i> within was carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone <i>vardad</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the oracle <i>she</i> prepared in the <i>lattie</i> within, to set there the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the covenant of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the oracle in the forepart was <i>dewey dacha</i> cubits in length, and <i>dewey dacha</i> cubits in breadth, and <i>dewey dacha</i> cubits in the height thereof: and <i>she</i> overlaid it with pure <i>gelt</i>; and so covered the <i>grovelling fakement</i> which was of cedar.
    </li>
    <li>So Solomon overlaid the <i>lattie</i> within with pure <i>gelt</i>: and <i>she</i> made a partition by the chains of <i>gelt</i> before the oracle; and <i>she</i> overlaid it with <i>gelt</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the whole <i>lattie</i> <i>she</i> overlaid with <i>gelt</i>, until <i>she</i> had finished all the <i>lattie</i>: also the whole <i>grovelling fakement</i> that was by the oracle <i>she</i> overlaid with <i>gelt</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And within the oracle <i>she</i> made <i>dewey</i> cherubims of olive tree, each <i>dacha</i> cubits high.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>chinker</i> cubits was the <i>una</i> wing of the cherub, and <i>chinker</i> cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the <i>una</i> wing unto the uttermost part of the other were <i>dacha</i> cubits.
    </li>
    <li>And the other cherub was <i>dacha</i> cubits: both the cherubims were of <i>una</i> measure and <i>una</i> size.
    </li>
    <li>The height of the <i>una</i> cherub was <i>dacha</i> cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> set the cherubims within the inner <i>lattie</i>: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the <i>una</i> <i>reefed</i> the <i>una</i> wall, and the wing of the other cherub <i>reefed</i> the other wall; and their wings <i>reefed</i> <i>una</i> another in the midst of the <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> overlaid the cherubims with <i>gelt</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> carved all the walls of the <i>lattie</i> round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and <i>nanti</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the floors of the <i>lattie</i> <i>she</i> overlaid with <i>gelt</i>, within and <i>nanti</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And for the entering of the oracle <i>she</i> made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>dewey</i> doors also were of olive tree; and <i>she</i> carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with <i>gelt</i>, and spread <i>gelt</i> upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.
    </li>
    <li>So also made <i>she</i> for the door of the <i>holy carsey</i> posts of olive tree, a <i>quarter</i> part of the wall.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dewey</i> doors were of fir tree: the <i>dewey</i> leaves of the <i>una</i> door were folding, and the <i>dewey</i> leaves of the other door were folding.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and covered them with <i>gelt</i> fitted upon the carved <i>acting dickey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> built the inner court with <i>trey</i> rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.
    </li>
    <li>In the <i>quarter</i> year was the foundation of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>laued</i>, in the month Zif:
    </li>
    <li>And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the <i>otterth</i> month, was the <i>lattie</i> finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was <i>she</i> <i>setter</i> years in building it.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>But Solomon was building <i>her</i> own <i>lattie</i> thirteen years, and <i>she</i> finished all <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> built also the <i>lattie</i> of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was an <i>chenter</i> cubits, and the breadth thereof <i>chinker dacha</i> cubits, and the height thereof <i>trey dacha</i> cubits, upon <i>quarter</i> rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.
    </li>
    <li>And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that <i>lett</i> on <i>quarter dacha</i> <i>chinker</i> pillars, fifteen in a row.
    </li>
    <li>And there were windows in <i>trey</i> rows, and <i>sparkle</i> was against <i>sparkle</i> in <i>trey</i> ranks.
    </li>
    <li>And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and <i>sparkle</i> was against <i>sparkle</i> in <i>trey</i> ranks.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was <i>chinker dacha</i> cubits, and the breadth thereof <i>trey dacha</i> cubits: and the porch was before them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>she</i> made a porch for the throne where <i>she</i> might <i>beak</i>, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from <i>una</i> side of the floor to the other.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i> where <i>she</i> <i>letted</i> had another court within the porch, which was of the like <i>acting dickey</i>. Solomon made also an <i>lattie</i> for Pharaoh&#8217;s <i>palone chavvie</i>, whom <i>she</i> had <i>lelled</i> to <i>palone affair</i>, like unto this porch.
    </li>
    <li>All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and <i>nanti</i>, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the <i>dowry</i> court.
    </li>
    <li>And the foundation was of costly stones, even <i>dowry</i> stones, stones of <i>dacha</i> cubits, and stones of <i>say dooe</i> cubits.
    </li>
    <li>And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowry</i> court round about was with <i>trey</i> rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and for the porch of the <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon <i>laued</i> and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> was a widow&#8217;s <i>homie chavvie</i> of the tribe of Naphtali, and <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> was a <i>homie</i> of Tyre, a worker in brass: and <i>she</i> was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to <i>acting dickey</i> all works in brass. And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> to <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon, and wrought all <i>her</i> <i>acting dickey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> cast <i>dewey</i> pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of <i>kenza</i> cubits did compass either of them about.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> made <i>dewey</i> chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the <i>una</i> chapiter was <i>chinker</i> cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was <i>chinker</i> cubits:
    </li>
    <li>And nets of checker <i>acting dickey</i>, and wreaths of chain <i>acting dickey</i>, for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; <i>setter</i> for the <i>una</i> chapiter, and <i>setter</i> for the other chapiter.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> made the pillars, and <i>dewey</i> rows round about upon the <i>una</i> network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did <i>she</i> for the other chapiter.
    </li>
    <li>And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily <i>acting dickey</i> in the porch, <i>quarter</i> cubits.
    </li>
    <li>And the chapiters upon the <i>dewey</i> pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were <i>dewey</i> <i>chenter</i> in rows round about upon the other chapiter.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> set up the pillars in the porch of the <i>holy carsey</i>: and <i>she</i> set up the <i>sweet</i> pillar, and <i>screeched</i> the name thereof Jachin: and <i>she</i> set up the <i>dry</i> pillar, and <i>screeched</i> the name thereof Boaz.
    </li>
    <li>And upon the top of the pillars was lily <i>acting dickey</i>: so was the <i>acting dickey</i> of the pillars finished.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> made a molten sea, <i>dacha</i> cubits from the <i>una</i> brim to the other: it was round all about, and <i>her</i> height was <i>chinker</i> cubits: and a line of <i>trey dacha</i> cubits did compass it round about.
    </li>
    <li>And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it, <i>dacha</i> in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in <i>dewey</i> rows, when it was cast.
    </li>
    <li>It stood upon <i>kenza</i> oxen, <i>trey</i> looking toward the north, and <i>trey</i> looking toward the west, and <i>trey</i> looking toward the south, and <i>trey</i> looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.
    </li>
    <li>And it was an <i>famble</i> breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained <i>dewey</i> <i>mille</i> baths.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> made <i>dacha</i> bases of brass; <i>quarter</i> cubits was the length of <i>una</i> base, and <i>quarter</i> cubits the breadth thereof, and <i>trey</i> cubits the height of it.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>acting dickey</i> of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges:
    </li>
    <li>And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin <i>acting dickey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And every base had <i>quarter</i> brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and the <i>quarter</i> corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver were undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>screech</i> of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit: but the <i>screech</i> thereof was round after the <i>acting dickey</i> of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the <i>screech</i> of it were gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.
    </li>
    <li>And under the borders were <i>quarter</i> wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>acting dickey</i> of the wheels was like the <i>acting dickey</i> of a <i>trundling cheat</i> wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, were all molten.
    </li>
    <li>And there were <i>quarter</i> undersetters to the <i>quarter</i> corners of <i>una</i> base: and the undersetters were of the <i>dowry</i> base itself.
    </li>
    <li>And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same.
    </li>
    <li>For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, <i>she</i> graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every <i>una</i>, and additions round about.
    </li>
    <li>After this manner <i>she</i> made the <i>dacha</i> bases: all of them had <i>una</i> <i>chucking</i>, <i>una</i> measure, and <i>una</i> size.
    </li>
    <li>Then made <i>she</i> <i>dacha</i> lavers of brass: <i>una</i> laver contained <i>quarter dacha</i> baths: and every laver was <i>quarter</i> cubits: and upon every <i>una</i> of the <i>dacha</i> bases <i>una</i> laver.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> put <i>chinker</i> bases on the <i>sweet</i> side of the <i>lattie</i>, and <i>chinker</i> on the <i>dry</i> side of the <i>lattie</i>: and <i>she</i> set the sea on the <i>sweet</i> side of the <i>lattie</i> eastward over against the south.
    </li>
    <li>And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram made an end of doing all the <i>acting dickey</i> that <i>she</i> made <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon for the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>:
    </li>
    <li>The <i>dewey</i> pillars, and the <i>dewey</i> bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the <i>dewey</i> pillars; and the <i>dewey</i> networks, to cover the <i>dewey</i> bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars;
    </li>
    <li>And <i>quarter</i> <i>chenter</i> pomegranates for the <i>dewey</i> networks, even <i>dewey</i> rows of pomegranates for <i>una</i> network, to cover the <i>dewey</i> bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars;
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dacha</i> bases, and <i>dacha</i> lavers on the bases;
    </li>
    <li>And <i>una</i> sea, and <i>kenza</i> oxen under the sea;
    </li>
    <li>And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these <i>fakements</i>, which Hiram made to <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon for the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, were of bright brass.
    </li>
    <li>In the plain of Jordan did the <i>dowriest homie</i> cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.
    </li>
    <li>And Solomon <i>dry</i> all the <i>fakements</i> unweighed, because they were exceeding many: <i>nishta</i> was the weight of the brass found out.
    </li>
    <li>And Solomon made all the <i>fakements</i> that pertained unto the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>: the <i>grovelling fakement</i> of <i>gelt</i>, and the table of <i>gelt</i>, whereupon the shewbread was,
    </li>
    <li>And the candlesticks of pure <i>gelt</i>, <i>chinker</i> on the <i>sweet</i> side, and <i>chinker</i> on the <i>dry</i>, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the <i>bincos</i>, and the tongs of <i>gelt</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers of pure <i>gelt</i>; and the hinges of <i>gelt</i>, both for the doors of the inner <i>lattie</i>, the most <i>fabulosa</i> place, and for the doors of the <i>lattie</i>, to wit, of the <i>holy carsey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So was ended all the <i>acting dickey</i> that <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon made for the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>. And Solomon brought in the <i>fakements</i> which <i>Davina</i> <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> had dedicated; even the silver, and the <i>gelt</i>, and the <i>fakements</i>, did <i>she</i> put among the <i>gelt</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Then Solomon assembled the <i>fungi</i> of Israel, and all the <i>ekes</i> of the tribes, the <i>dowriest</i> of the <i>aunties</i> of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, unto <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might <i>parker</i> up the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the covenant of the <i>Duchess</i> out of the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i>, which is Zion.
    </li>
    <li>And all the <i>homies</i> of Israel assembled themselves unto <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon at the <i>dowry munjarlee</i> in the month Ethanim, which is the <i>setterth</i> month.
    </li>
    <li>And all the <i>fungi</i> of Israel <i>trolled</i>, and the <i>godly homies</i> <i>lelled</i> up the <i>bijou arkette</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they brought up the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and the <i>bijou tabernaclette</i> of the <i>punters</i>, and all the <i>fabulosa</i> <i>fakements</i> that were in the <i>bijou tabernaclette</i>, even those did the <i>godly homies</i> and the Levites <i>parker</i> up.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon, and all the <i>punters</i> of Israel, that were assembled unto <i>her</i>, were with <i>her</i> before the <i>bijou arkette</i>, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be <i>cackled</i> <i>nishta</i> numbered for multitude.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>godly homies</i> brought in the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the covenant of the <i>Duchess</i> unto <i>her</i> place, into the oracle of the <i>lattie</i>, to the most <i>fabulosa</i> place, even under the wings of the cherubims.
    </li>
    <li>For the cherubims spread forth their <i>dewey</i> wings over the place of the <i>bijou arkette</i>, and the cherubims covered the <i>bijou arkette</i> and the staves thereof above.
    </li>
    <li>And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were <i>vardad</i> out in the <i>fabulosa</i> place before the oracle, and they were not <i>vardad</i> <i>nanti</i>: and there they are unto this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>There was <i>nishter</i> in the <i>bijou arkette</i> save the <i>dewey</i> tables of stone, which <i>Maureen</i> put there at Horeb, when the <i>Duchess</i> made a covenant with the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, when they <i>trolled</i> out of the land of Egypt.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when the <i>godly homies</i> were <i>troll</i> out of the <i>fabulosa</i> place, that the cloud filled the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>,
    </li>
    <li>So that the <i>godly homies</i> could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the <i>fabeness</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> had filled the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> Solomon, The <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> that <i>she</i> would <i>lett</i> in the thick <i>munge</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I have surely built thee an <i>lattie</i> to <i>lett</i> in, a settled place for thee to <i>lett</i> in for ever.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> turned <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> about, and <i>fabed</i> all the <i>punters</i> of Israel: (and all the <i>punters</i> of Israel stood;)
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>fabed</i> be the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, which <i>cackled</i> with <i>her</i> <i>screech</i> unto <i>Davina</i> my <i>Auntie</i>, and hath with <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> fulfilled it, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Since the <i>journo</i> that I brought forth my <i>homies and palones</i> Israel out of Egypt, I chose no <i>smoke</i> out of all the tribes of Israel to build an <i>lattie</i>, that my name might be therein; but I chose <i>Davina</i> to be over my <i>homies and palones</i> Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And it was in the <i>thumping cheat</i> of <i>Davina</i> my <i>Auntie</i> to build an <i>lattie</i> for the name of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Davina</i> my <i>Auntie</i>, Whereas it was in thine <i>thumping cheat</i> to build an <i>lattie</i> unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thine <i>thumping cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> <i>nishta</i> build the <i>lattie</i>; but thy <i>homie chavvie</i> that shall <i>troll</i> forth out of thy loins, <i>she</i> shall build the <i>lattie</i> unto my name.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> hath performed <i>her</i> <i>lav</i> that <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, and I am risen up in the room of <i>Davina</i> my <i>Auntie</i>, and <i>lett</i> on the throne of Israel, as the <i>Duchess</i> promised, and have built an <i>lattie</i> for the name of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And I have set there a place for the <i>bijou arkette</i>, wherein is the covenant of the <i>Duchess</i>, which <i>she</i> made with our <i>aunties</i>, when <i>she</i> brought them out of the land of Egypt.
    </li>
    <li>And Solomon stood before the <i>grovelling fakement</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> in the presence of all the <i>punters</i> of Israel, and spread forth <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i> toward heaven:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, there is no <i>Gloria</i> like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy <i>serving homies</i> that <i>mince</i> before thee with all their <i>thumping cheat</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Who hast kept with thy <i>serving homie</i> <i>Davina</i> my <i>Auntie</i> that thou promisedst <i>her</i>: thou spakest also with thy <i>screech</i>, and hast fulfilled it with thine <i>famble</i>, as it is this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore now, <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, keep with thy <i>serving homie</i> <i>Davina</i> my <i>Auntie</i> that thou promisedst <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, There shall not fail thee a <i>homie</i> in my <i>vardaing</i> to <i>lett</i> on the throne of Israel; so that thy <i>chavvies</i> <i>lell</i> heed to their way, that they <i>mince</i> before me as thou hast <i>minced</i> before me.
    </li>
    <li>And now, O <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, let thy <i>lav</i>, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy <i>serving homie</i> <i>Davina</i> my <i>Auntie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But will <i>Gloria</i> indeed <i>lett</i> on the earth? <i>varda</i>, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how <i>dowry</i> <i>nanti dowry</i> this <i>lattie</i> that I have builded?
    </li>
    <li>Yet have thou respect unto the <i>meshigener muttering</i> of thy <i>serving homie</i>, and to <i>her</i> supplication, O <i>Duchess</i> my <i>Gloria</i>, to <i>aunt nell</i> unto the <i>screech</i> and to the <i>meshigener muttering</i>, which thy <i>serving homie</i> prayeth before thee to <i>journo</i>:
    </li>
    <li>That thine <i>ogles</i> may be open toward this <i>lattie</i> <i>nochy</i> and <i>journo</i>, even toward the place of which thou hast <i>cackled</i>, My name shall be there: that thou mayest <i>aunt nell</i> unto the <i>meshigener muttering</i> which thy <i>serving homie</i> shall make toward this place.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>aunt nell</i> thou to the supplication of thy <i>serving homie</i>, and of thy <i>homies and palones</i> Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and <i>aunt nell</i> thou in heaven thy <i>lattie</i>: and when thou hearest, forgive.
    </li>
    <li>If any <i>homie</i> <i>caterver</i> against <i>her</i> <i>homie ajax</i>, and an oath be <i>laued</i> upon <i>her</i> to cause <i>her</i> to swear, and the oath <i>troll</i> before thine <i>grovelling fakement</i> in this <i>lattie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>aunt nell</i> thou in heaven, and do, and <i>beak</i> thy <i>serving homies</i>, condemning the <i>naff</i>, to <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> way upon <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>; and justifying the <i>bona</i>, to <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> according to <i>her</i> <i>bonaness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>When thy <i>homies and palones</i> Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have <i>kertervered</i> against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and <i>dish</i> thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this <i>lattie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>aunt nell</i> thou in heaven, and forgive the <i>kertever</i> of thy <i>homies and palones</i> Israel, and <i>parker</i> them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their <i>aunties</i>.
    </li>
    <li>When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have <i>kertervered</i> against thee; if they pray toward this place, and <i>dish</i> thy name, and turn from their <i>kertever</i>, when thou afflictest them:
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>aunt nell</i> thou in heaven, and forgive the <i>kertever</i> of thy <i>serving homies</i>, and of thy <i>homies and palones</i> Israel, that thou teach them the <i>bona</i> way wherein they should <i>mince</i>, and <i>parker</i> rain upon thy land, which thou hast <i>parkered</i> to thy <i>homies and palones</i> for an inheritance.
    </li>
    <li>If there be in the land <i>nix munjarlee</i>, if there be <i>bad style</i>, blasting, mildew, locust, or if there be caterpiller; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their <i>smokes</i>; whatsoever plague, whatsoever <i>kerterver coddy</i> there be;

    <li>What <i>meshigener muttering</i> and supplication soever be made by any <i>homie</i>, or by all thy <i>homies and palones</i> Israel, which shall know every <i>homie</i> the plague of <i>her</i> own <i>thumping cheat</i>, and spread forth <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i> toward this <i>lattie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>aunt nell</i> thou in heaven thy <i>lattie</i>, and forgive, and do, and <i>parker</i> to every <i>homie</i> according to <i>her</i> ways, whose <i>thumping cheat</i> thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the <i>thumping cheats</i> of all the <i>chavvies</i> of <i>homies</i>😉
    </li>
    <li>That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our <i>aunties</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy <i>homies and palones</i> Israel, but <i>trolleth</i> out of a far country for thy name&#8217;s sake;
    </li>
    <li>(For they shall <i>aunt nell</i> of thy <i>dowry</i> name, and of thy <i>butch</i> <i>famble</i>, and of thy stretched out arm;) when <i>she</i> shall <i>troll</i> and pray toward this <i>lattie</i>;

    <li><i>Aunt nell</i> thou in heaven thy <i>lattie</i>, and do according to all that the stranger <i>screecheth</i> to thee for: that all <i>homies and palones</i> of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy <i>homies and palones</i> Israel; and that they may know that this <i>lattie</i>, which I have builded, is <i>screeched</i> by thy name.
    </li>
    <li>If thy <i>homies and palones</i> <i>troll out</i> to battle against their enemy, whithersoever thou shalt <i>lau</i> them, and shall pray unto the <i>Duchess</i> toward the <i>smoke</i> which thou hast chosen, and toward the <i>lattie</i> that I have built for thy name:
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>aunt nell</i> thou in heaven their <i>meshigener muttering</i> and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
    </li>
    <li>If they <i>kertever</i> against thee, (for there is no <i>homie</i> that <i>kertervereth</i> not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near;
    </li>
    <li>Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were <i>lelled</i> captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that <i>lelled</i> them captives, <i>cackling</i>, We have <i>kertervered</i>, and have done perversely, we have committed <i>naffness</i>;

    <li>And so return unto thee with all their <i>thumping cheat</i>, and with all their <i>nishta lucoddy</i>, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their <i>aunties</i>, the <i>smoke</i> which thou hast chosen, and the <i>lattie</i> which I have built for thy name:
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>aunt nell</i> thou their <i>meshigener muttering</i> and their supplication in heaven thy <i>lattie</i>, and maintain their cause,
    </li>
    <li>And forgive thy <i>homies and palones</i> that have <i>kertervered</i> against thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee, and <i>parker</i> them compassion before them who <i>lelled</i> them captive, that they may have compassion on them:
    </li>
    <li>For they be thy <i>homies and palones</i>, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron:
    </li>
    <li>That thine <i>ogles</i> may be open unto the supplication of thy <i>serving homie</i>, and unto the supplication of thy <i>homies and palones</i> Israel, to <i>aunt nell</i> unto them in all that they <i>screech</i> for unto thee.
    </li>
    <li>For thou didst separate them from among all the <i>homies and palones</i> of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the <i>famble</i> of <i>Maureen</i> thy <i>serving homie</i>, when thou broughtest our <i>aunties</i> out of Egypt, O <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this <i>meshigener muttering</i> and supplication unto the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>she</i> arose from before the <i>grovelling fakement</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, from kneeling on <i>her</i> knees with <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i> spread up to heaven.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> stood, and <i>fabed</i> all the <i>punters</i> of Israel with a loud <i>cackling fakement</i>, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Fabed</i> be the <i>Duchess</i>, that hath <i>parkered</i> <i>lettie</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i> Israel, according to all that <i>she</i> promised: there hath not failed <i>una</i> <i>lav</i> of all <i>her</i> <i>bona</i> promise, which <i>she</i> promised by the <i>famble</i> of <i>Maureen</i> <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i> be with us, as <i>she</i> was with our <i>aunties</i>: let <i>her</i> not leave us, <i>nishta</i> forsake us:
    </li>
    <li>That <i>she</i> may incline our <i>thumping cheats</i> unto <i>her</i>, to <i>mince</i> in all <i>her</i> ways, and to keep <i>her</i> <i>butch lavs</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>dowry lavs</i>, and <i>her</i> judgments, which <i>she</i> commanded our <i>aunties</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And let these my <i>lavs</i>, wherewith I have made supplication before the <i>Duchess</i>, be <i>ajax</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i> <i>journo</i> and <i>nochy</i>, that <i>she</i> maintain the cause of <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i>, and the cause of <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i> Israel at all times, as the matter shall require:
    </li>
    <li>That all the <i>homies and palones</i> of the earth may know that the <i>Duchess</i> is <i>Gloria</i>, and that there is none else.
    </li>
    <li>Let your <i>thumping cheat</i> therefore be <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i> with the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i>, to <i>mince</i> in <i>her</i> <i>dowry lavs</i>, and to keep <i>her</i> <i>butch lavs</i>, as at this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and all Israel with <i>her</i>, offered <i>parker</i> before the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Solomon offered a <i>parker</i> of peace <i>parkerings</i>, which <i>she</i> offered unto the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>dewey</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i> <i>mille</i> oxen, and an <i>chenter</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i> <i>mille</i> sheep. So the <i>dowriest homie</i> and all the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel dedicated the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The same <i>journo</i> did the <i>dowriest homie</i> hallow the middle of the court that was before the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>: for there <i>she</i> offered burnt <i>parkerings</i>, and <i>carnish</i> <i>parkerings</i>, and the fat of the peace <i>parkerings</i>: because the brasen <i>grovelling fakement</i> that was before the <i>Duchess</i> was too <i>bijou</i> to <i>lall</i> the burnt <i>parkerings</i>, and <i>carnish</i> <i>parkerings</i>, and the fat of the peace <i>parkerings</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And at that time Solomon held a <i>dowry munjarlee</i>, and all Israel with <i>her</i>, a <i>dowry</i> <i>punters</i>, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i>, <i>setter</i> days and <i>setter</i> days, even fourteen days.
    </li>
    <li>On the <i>otterth</i> <i>journo</i> <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> the <i>homies and palones</i> away: and they <i>fabed</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and <i>trolled</i> unto their <i>trolling letties</i> <i>bona</i> and glad of <i>thumping cheat</i> for all the goodness that the <i>Duchess</i> had done for <i>Davina</i> <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i>, and for Israel <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>.

    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when Solomon had finished the building of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, and all Solomon&#8217;s <i>fancy</i> which <i>she</i> was pleased to do,
    </li>
    <li>That the <i>Duchess</i> appeared to Solomon the second time, as <i>she</i> had appeared unto <i>her</i> at Gibeon.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, I have <i>aunt nelled</i> thy <i>meshigener muttering</i> and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this <i>lattie</i>, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine <i>ogles</i> and mine <i>thumping cheat</i> shall be there perpetually.
    </li>
    <li>And if thou wilt <i>mince</i> before me, as <i>Davina</i> thy <i>Auntie</i> <i>minced</i>, in integrity of <i>thumping cheat</i>, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my <i>dowry lavs</i> and my judgments:
    </li>
    <li>Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever, as I promised to <i>Davina</i> thy <i>Auntie</i>, <i>cackling</i>, There shall not fail thee a <i>homie</i> upon the throne of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your <i>chavvies</i>, and will not keep my <i>butch lavs</i> and my <i>dowry lavs</i> which I have set before you, but <i>troll</i> and serve other gods, and worship them:
    </li>
    <li>Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have <i>parkered</i> them; and this <i>lattie</i>, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my <i>vardaing</i>; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all <i>homies and palones</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And at this <i>lattie</i>, which is high, every <i>una</i> that passeth by it shall be <i>gobsmacked</i>, and shall hiss; and they shall <i>cackle</i>, Why hath the <i>Duchess</i> done thus unto this land, and to this <i>lattie</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And they shall answer, Because they forsook the <i>Duchess</i> their <i>Gloria</i>, who brought forth their <i>aunties</i> out of the land of Egypt, and have <i>lelled</i> hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath the <i>Duchess</i> brought upon them all this <i>nana</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> at the end of <i>dewey dacha</i> years, when Solomon had built the <i>dewey</i> <i>latties</i>, the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>,
    </li>
    <li>(Now Hiram the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with <i>gelt</i>, according to all <i>her</i> <i>fancy</i>,) that then <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon <i>parkered</i> Hiram <i>dewey dacha</i> <i>smokes</i> in the land of Galilee.
    </li>
    <li>And Hiram <i>trolled</i> out from Tyre to <i>varda</i> the <i>smokes</i> which Solomon had <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i>; and they pleased <i>her</i> not.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, What <i>smokes</i> are these which thou hast <i>parkered</i> me, my <i>sister</i>? And <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> them the land of Cabul unto this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Hiram <i>laued</i> to the <i>dowriest homie</i> sixscore talents of <i>gelt</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And this is the reason of the levy which <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon raised; for to build the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>her</i> own <i>lattie</i>, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.
    </li>
    <li>For Pharaoh <i>dowriest homie</i> of Egypt had <i>trolled</i> up, and <i>lelled</i> Gezer, and burnt it with <i>binco fakement</i>, and <i>ferricadoozed</i> the Canaanites that <i>letted</i> in the <i>smoke</i>, and <i>parkered</i> it for a present unto <i>her</i> <i>palone chavvie</i>, Solomon&#8217;s <i>palone affair</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Solomon built Gezer, and Bethhoron the nether,
    </li>
    <li>And Baalath, and Tadmor in the <i>nishta smoke</i>, in the land,
    </li>
    <li>And all the <i>smokes</i> of store that Solomon had, and <i>smokes</i> for <i>her</i> <i>rattling coves</i>, and <i>smokes</i> for <i>her</i> horsemen, and that which Solomon <i>fancied</i> to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of <i>her</i> dominion.
    </li>
    <li>And all the <i>homies and palones</i> that were <i>dry</i> of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel,
    </li>
    <li>Their <i>chavvies</i> that were <i>dry</i> after them in the land, whom the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel also were not able utterly to <i>battyfang</i>, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but they were <i>homies</i> of <i>barney</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>princesses</i>, and <i>her</i> captains, and rulers of <i>her</i> <i>rattling coves</i>, and <i>her</i> horsemen.
    </li>
    <li>These were the <i>dowriest</i> of the <i>hilda handcuffs</i> that were over Solomon&#8217;s <i>acting dickey</i>, <i>chinker</i> <i>chenter</i> and <i>chinker dacha</i>, which bare rule over the <i>homies and palones</i> that wrought in the <i>acting dickey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But Pharaoh&#8217;s <i>palone chavvie</i> <i>trolled</i> up out of the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i> unto her <i>lattie</i> which Solomon had built for her: then did <i>she</i> build Millo.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>trey</i> times in a year did Solomon offer burnt <i>parkerings</i> and peace <i>parkerings</i> upon the <i>grovelling fakement</i> which <i>she</i> built unto the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>she</i> burnt <i>smelly</i> upon the <i>grovelling fakement</i> that was before the <i>Duchess</i>. So <i>she</i> finished the <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon made a navy of <i>latties on water</i> in Eziongeber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.
    </li>
    <li>And Hiram <i>laued</i> in the navy <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the <i>serving homies</i> of Solomon.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>trolled</i> to Ophir, and fetched from thence <i>gelt</i>, <i>quarter</i> <i>chenter</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i> talents, and brought it to <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And when the <i>dowriest palone</i> of Sheba <i>aunt nelled</i> of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the <i>Duchess</i>, she <i>trolled</i> to prove <i>her</i> with hard questions.
    </li>
    <li>And she <i>trolled</i> to Jerusalem with a <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry</i> train, with camels that bare spices, and <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry</i> <i>gelt</i>, and precious stones: and when she was <i>troll</i> to Solomon, she <i>dished the dirt</i> with <i>her</i> of all that was in her <i>thumping cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Solomon <i>cackled</i> her all her questions: there was not any <i>fakement</i> hid from the <i>dowriest homie</i>, which <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> her not.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>dowriest palone</i> of Sheba had <i>vardad</i> all Solomon&#8217;s wisdom, and the <i>lattie</i> that <i>she</i> had built,
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>carnish</i> of <i>her</i> table, and the sitting of <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>, and the attendance of <i>her</i> ministers, and their <i>schmutter</i>, and <i>her</i> cupbearers, and <i>her</i> <i>trolling up</i> by which <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> up unto the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>; there was <i>nishta</i> <i>Fairy</i> in her.
    </li>
    <li>And she <i>cackled</i> to the <i>dowriest homie</i>, It was a true report that I <i>aunt nelled</i> in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.
    </li>
    <li>Howbeit I believed not the <i>lavs</i>, until I <i>trolled</i>, and mine <i>ogles</i> had <i>vardad</i> it: and, <i>varda</i>, the half was not <i>cackled</i> me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I <i>aunt nelled</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Happy are thy <i>homies</i>, happy are these thy <i>serving homies</i>, which stand continually before thee, and that <i>aunt nell</i> thy wisdom.
    </li>
    <li><i>Fabed</i> be the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i>, which delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because the <i>Duchess</i> loved Israel for ever, therefore made <i>she</i> thee <i>dowriest homie</i>, to do judgment and justice.
    </li>
    <li>And she <i>parkered</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> an <i>chenter</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i> talents of <i>gelt</i>, and of spices <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry</i> store, and precious stones: there <i>trolled</i> <i>nishta</i> such abundance of spices as these which the <i>dowriest palone</i> of Sheba <i>parkered</i> to <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon.
    </li>
    <li>And the navy also of Hiram, that brought <i>gelt</i> from Ophir, brought in from Ophir <i>dowry</i> plenty of almug trees, and precious stones.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> made of the almug trees pillars for the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and for the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, harps also and psalteries for singers: there <i>trolled</i> no such almug trees, <i>nishta</i> were <i>vardad</i> unto this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon <i>parkered</i> unto the <i>dowriest palone</i> of Sheba all her <i>fancy</i>, whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon <i>parkered</i> her of <i>her</i> royal bounty. So she turned and <i>trolled</i> to her own country, she and her <i>serving homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now the weight of <i>gelt</i> that <i>trolled</i> to Solomon in <i>una</i> year was <i>sey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> and <i>sey</i> talents of <i>gelt</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Beside that <i>she</i> had of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice <i>bodega homies</i>, and of all the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon made <i>dewey</i> <i>chenter</i> targets of beaten <i>gelt</i>: <i>sey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>medzers</i> of <i>gelt</i> <i>trolled</i> to <i>una</i> target.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> made <i>trey</i> <i>chenter</i> shields of beaten <i>gelt</i>; <i>trey</i> pound of <i>gelt</i> <i>trolled</i> to <i>una</i> shield: and the <i>dowriest homie</i> put them in the <i>lattie</i> of the forest of Lebanon.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover the <i>dowriest homie</i> made a <i>dowry</i> throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best <i>gelt</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The throne had <i>sey</i> steps, and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and <i>dewey</i> lions stood beside the stays.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>kenza</i> lions stood there on the <i>una</i> side and on the other upon the <i>sey</i> steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.
    </li>
    <li>And all <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon&#8217;s <i>bevvying</i> <i>fakements</i> were of <i>gelt</i>, and all the <i>fakements</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of the forest of Lebanon were of pure <i>gelt</i>; none were of silver: it was <i>nishter</i> accounted of in the days of Solomon.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>dowriest homie</i> had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in <i>trey</i> years <i>trolled</i> the navy of Tharshish, bringing <i>gelt</i>, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
    </li>
    <li>So <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon exceeded all the <i>dowriest homies</i> of the earth for riches and for wisdom.
    </li>
    <li>And all the earth sought to Solomon, to <i>aunt nell</i> <i>her</i> wisdom, which <i>Gloria</i> had put in <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they brought every <i>homie</i> <i>her</i> present, <i>fakements</i> of silver, and <i>fakements</i> of <i>gelt</i>, and <i>frocks</i>, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
    </li>
    <li>And Solomon gathered together <i>rattling coves</i> and horsemen: and <i>she</i> had a <i>mille</i> and <i>quarter</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>rattling coves</i>, and <i>kenza</i> <i>mille</i> horsemen, whom <i>she</i> bestowed in the <i>smokes</i> for <i>rattling coves</i>, and with the <i>dowriest homie</i> at Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made <i>she</i> to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for abundance.
    </li>
    <li>And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and <i>lycra</i> yarn: the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>bodega homies</i> <i>lalled</i> the <i>lycra</i> yarn at a price.
    </li>
    <li>And a <i>trundling cheat</i> <i>trolled</i> up and <i>trolled</i> out of Egypt for <i>sey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>medzers</i> of silver, and an horse for an <i>chenter</i> and <i>chinker dacha</i>: and so for all the <i>dowriest homies</i> of the Hittites, and for the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Syria, did they <i>parker</i> them out by their means.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>But <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon loved many strange <i>palones</i>, together with the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Pharaoh, <i>palones</i> of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites:
    </li>
    <li>Of the nations concerning which the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, <i>nanti</i> <i>troll</i> in to them, <i>nishta</i> shall they <i>troll</i> in unto you: for surely they will turn away your <i>thumping cheat</i> after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> had <i>setter</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>palone affairs</i>, princesses, and <i>trey</i> <i>chenter</i> concubines: and <i>her</i> <i>palone affairs</i> turned away <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For it <i>trolled</i> to pass, when Solomon was <i>badge</i>, that <i>her</i> <i>palone affairs</i> turned away <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> after other gods: and <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> was not <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i> with the <i>Duchess</i> <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i>, as was the <i>thumping cheat</i> of <i>Davina</i> <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For Solomon <i>trolled</i> after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the <i>dowry cod</i> of the Ammonites.
    </li>
    <li>And Solomon did <i>nana</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>trolled</i> not fully after the <i>Duchess</i>, as did <i>Davina</i> <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the <i>dowry cod</i> of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the <i>dowry cod</i> of the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon.
    </li>
    <li>And likewise did <i>she</i> for all <i>her</i> strange <i>palone affairs</i>, which burnt <i>smelly</i> and sacrificed unto their gods.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> was angry with Solomon, because <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> was turned from the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, which had appeared unto <i>her</i> twice,
    </li>
    <li>And had commanded <i>her</i> concerning this <i>fakement</i>, that <i>she</i> should not <i>troll</i> after other gods: but <i>she</i> kept not that which the <i>Duchess</i> commanded.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my <i>dowry lavs</i>, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will <i>parker</i> it to thy <i>serving homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for <i>Davina</i> thy <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s sake: but I will rend it out of the <i>famble</i> of thy <i>homie chavvie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will <i>parker</i> <i>una</i> tribe to thy <i>homie chavvie</i> for <i>Davina</i> my <i>serving homie</i>&#8216;s sake, and for Jerusalem&#8217;s sake which I have chosen.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: <i>she</i> was of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>maria</i> in Edom.
    </li>
    <li>For it <i>trolled</i> to pass, when <i>Davina</i> was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was <i>trolled</i> up to bury the <i>ferricadoozed</i>, after <i>she</i> had smitten every <i>omee</i> in Edom;
    </li>
    <li>(For <i>sey</i> months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until <i>she</i> had cut off every <i>omee</i> in Edom:)
    </li>
    <li>That Hadad fled, <i>she</i> and certain Edomites of <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s <i>serving homies</i> with <i>her</i>, to <i>troll</i> into Egypt; Hadad being yet a <i>bijou</i> <i>chavvie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they arose out of Midian, and <i>trolled</i> to Paran: and they <i>lelled</i> <i>homies</i> with them out of Paran, and they <i>trolled</i> to Egypt, unto Pharaoh <i>dowriest homie</i> of Egypt; which <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> an <i>lattie</i>, and appointed <i>her</i> victuals, and <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> land.
    </li>
    <li>And Hadad found <i>dowry</i> favour in the <i>vardaing</i> of Pharaoh, so that <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> to <i>palone affair</i> the sister of <i>her</i> own <i>palone affair</i>, the sister of Tahpenes the <i>dowriest palone</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the sister of Tahpenes bare <i>her</i> Genubath <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh&#8217;s <i>lattie</i>: and Genubath was in Pharaoh&#8217;s household among the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Pharaoh.
    </li>
    <li>And when Hadad <i>aunt nelled</i> in Egypt that <i>Davina</i> <i>lettied</i> with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>, and that Joab the captain of the host was <i>stiff</i>, Hadad <i>cackled</i> to Pharaoh, Let me <i>troll off</i>, that I may <i>troll</i> to mine own country.
    </li>
    <li>Then Pharaoh <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, <i>varda</i>, thou <i>charperest</i> to <i>troll</i> to thine own country? And <i>she</i> answered, <i>nishter</i>: howbeit let me <i>troll</i> in any wise.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Gloria</i> stirred <i>her</i> up another adversary, Rezon the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Eliadah, which fled from <i>her</i> <i>Duchess</i> Hadadezer <i>dowriest homie</i> of Zobah:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> gathered <i>homies</i> unto <i>her</i>, and became captain over a band, when <i>Davina</i> <i>ferricadoozaed</i> them of Zobah: and they <i>trolled</i> to Damascus, and <i>letted</i> therein, and reigned in Damascus.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did: and <i>she</i> abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.
    </li>
    <li>And Jeroboam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon&#8217;s <i>serving homie</i>, whose mother&#8217;s name was Zeruah, a widow <i>palone</i>, even <i>she</i> lifted up <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> against the <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And this was the cause that <i>she</i> lifted up <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> against the <i>dowriest homie</i>: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i> <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>homie</i> Jeroboam was a <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homie</i> of valour: and Solomon <i>vardaing</i> the <i>bean cove</i> that <i>she</i> was industrious, <i>she</i> made <i>her</i> ruler over all the charge of the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Josephine</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> at that time when Jeroboam <i>trolled</i> out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found <i>her</i> in the way; and <i>she</i> had clad himself with a new <i>frock</i>; and they <i>dewey</i> were alone in the field:
    </li>
    <li>And Ahijah caught the new <i>frock</i> that was on <i>her</i>, and rent it in <i>kenza</i> pieces:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> to Jeroboam, <i>lell</i> thee <i>dacha</i> pieces: for thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, the <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, <i>varda</i>, I will rend the kingdom out of the <i>famble</i> of Solomon, and will <i>parker</i> <i>dacha</i> tribes to thee:
    </li>
    <li>(But <i>she</i> shall have <i>una</i> tribe for my <i>serving homie</i> <i>Davina</i>&#8216;s sake, and for Jerusalem&#8217;s sake, the <i>smoke</i> which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:)
    </li>
    <li>Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the <i>Gloria</i> of the Moabites, and Milcom the <i>Gloria</i> of the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon, and have not <i>minced</i> in my ways, to do that which is <i>sweet</i> in mine <i>ogles</i>, and to keep my <i>dowry lavs</i> and my judgments, as did <i>Davina</i> <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Howbeit I will not <i>lell</i> the whole kingdom out of <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>: but I will make <i>her</i> <i>princess</i> all the days of <i>her</i> life for <i>Davina</i> my <i>serving homie</i>&#8216;s sake, whom I chose, because <i>she</i> kept my <i>butch lavs</i> and my <i>dowry lavs</i>:
    </li>
    <li>But I will <i>lell</i> the kingdom out of <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>&#8216;s <i>famble</i>, and will <i>parker</i> it unto thee, even <i>dacha</i> tribes.
    </li>
    <li>And unto <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> will I <i>parker</i> <i>una</i> tribe, that <i>Davina</i> my <i>serving homie</i> may have a <i>sparkle</i> alway before me in Jerusalem, the <i>smoke</i> which I have chosen me to put my name there.
    </li>
    <li>And I will <i>lell</i> thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy <i>nishta lucoddy</i> desireth, and shalt be <i>dowriest homie</i> over Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And it shall be, if thou wilt <i>aunt nell</i> unto all that I command thee, and wilt <i>mince</i> in my ways, and do that is <i>sweet</i> in my <i>vardaing</i>, to keep my <i>dowry lavs</i> and my <i>butch lavs</i>, as <i>Davina</i> my <i>serving homie</i> did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a sure <i>lattie</i>, as I built for <i>Davina</i>, and will <i>parker</i> Israel unto thee.
    </li>
    <li>And I will for this afflict the <i>maria</i> of <i>Davina</i>, but not for ever.
    </li>
    <li>Solomon sought therefore to <i>ferricadoza</i> Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak <i>dowriest homie</i> of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the <i>carking it</i> of Solomon.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>lettie</i> of the acts of Solomon, and all that <i>she</i> did, and <i>her</i> wisdom, are they not <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the acts of Solomon?
    </li>
    <li>And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was <i>quarter dacha</i> years.
    </li>
    <li>And Solomon <i>lettied</i> with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>, and was buried in the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i> <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>: and Rehoboam <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> reigned in <i>her</i> stead.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And Rehoboam <i>trolled</i> to Shechem: for all Israel were <i>troll</i> to Shechem to make <i>her</i> <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when Jeroboam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, <i>aunt nelled</i> of it, (for <i>she</i> was fled from the presence of <i>dowriest homie</i> Solomon, and Jeroboam <i>letted</i> in Egypt;)
    </li>
    <li>That they <i>laued</i> and <i>screeched</i> <i>her</i>. And Jeroboam and all the <i>punters</i> of Israel <i>trolled</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto Rehoboam, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Thy <i>Auntie</i> made our yoke <i>naff</i>: now therefore make thou the <i>naff</i> service of thy <i>Auntie</i>, and <i>her</i> heavy yoke which <i>she</i> put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>troll off</i> yet for <i>trey</i> days, then <i>troll</i> again to me. And the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>trolled off</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>dowriest homie</i> Rehoboam consulted with the <i>badge coves</i>, that stood before Solomon <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> while <i>she</i> yet lived, and <i>cackled</i>, How do ye advise that I may answer this <i>homies and palones</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, If thou wilt be a <i>serving homie</i> unto this <i>homies and palones</i> this <i>journo</i>, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and <i>cackle</i> <i>bona</i> <i>lavs</i> to them, then they will be thy <i>serving homies</i> for ever.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> forsook the counsel of the <i>badge coves</i>, which they had <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i>, and consulted with the <i>bean coves</i> that were grown up with <i>her</i>, and which stood before <i>her</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, What counsel <i>parker</i> ye that we may answer this <i>homies and palones</i>, who have <i>cackled</i> to me, <i>cackling</i>, Make the yoke which thy <i>Auntie</i> did put upon us lighter?
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>bean coves</i> that were grown up with <i>her</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Thus shalt thou <i>cackle</i> unto this <i>homies and palones</i> that <i>cackled</i> unto thee, <i>cackling</i>, Thy <i>Auntie</i> made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou <i>cackle</i> unto them, My <i>bijou</i> <i>lupper</i> shall be thicker than my <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s loins.
    </li>
    <li>And now whereas my <i>Auntie</i> did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my <i>Auntie</i> hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
    </li>
    <li>So Jeroboam and all the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>trolled</i> to Rehoboam the third <i>journo</i>, as the <i>dowriest homie</i> had appointed, <i>cackling</i>, <i>troll</i> to me again the third <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> answered the <i>homies and palones</i> roughly, and forsook the <i>badge coves</i>&#8216;s counsel that they <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackled</i> to them after the counsel of the <i>bean coves</i>, <i>cackling</i>, My <i>Auntie</i> made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my <i>Auntie</i> also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> not unto the <i>homies and palones</i>; for the cause was from the <i>Duchess</i>, that <i>she</i> might perform <i>her</i> <i>cackling</i>, which the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nebat.
    </li>
    <li>So when all Israel <i>vardad</i> that the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> not unto them, the <i>homies and palones</i> answered the <i>dowriest homie</i>, <i>cackling</i>, What portion have we in <i>Davina</i>? <i>nishta</i> have we inheritance in the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jesse: to your <i>trolling letties</i>, O Israel: now <i>varda</i> to thine own <i>lattie</i>, <i>Davina</i>. So Israel <i>trolled off</i> unto their <i>trolling letties</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But as for the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel which <i>letted</i> in the <i>smokes</i> of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>dowriest homie</i> Rehoboam <i>laued</i> Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all Israel stoned <i>her</i> with stones, that <i>she</i> <i>carked it</i>. Therefore <i>dowriest homie</i> Rehoboam made speed to get <i>her</i> up to <i>her</i> <i>trundling cheat</i>, to <i>scarper</i> to Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>So Israel rebelled against the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Davina</i> unto this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when all Israel <i>aunt nelled</i> that Jeroboam was <i>troll</i> again, that they <i>laued</i> and <i>screeched</i> <i>her</i> unto the <i>punters</i>, and made <i>her</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> over all Israel: there was none that <i>trolled after</i> the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Davina</i>, but the tribe of Judah only.
    </li>
    <li>And when Rehoboam was <i>troll</i> to Jerusalem, <i>she</i> assembled all the <i>lattie</i> of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an <i>chenter</i> and fourscore <i>mille</i> chosen <i>homies</i>, which were warriors, to <i>palaver</i> against the <i>lattie</i> of Israel, to <i>parker</i> the kingdom again to Rehoboam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Solomon.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>trolled</i> unto Shemaiah the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackle</i> unto Rehoboam, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Solomon, <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, and unto all the <i>lattie</i> of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>nanti</i> <i>troll</i> up, <i>nishta</i> <i>palaver</i> against your <i>sisters</i> the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel: return every <i>homie</i> to <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>; for this <i>fakement</i> is from me. They <i>aunt nelled</i> therefore to the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>trolled back to</i> <i>troll off</i>, according to the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and <i>letted</i> therein; and <i>trolled</i> out from thence, and built Penuel.
    </li>
    <li>And Jeroboam <i>cackled</i> in <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>, Now shall the kingdom <i>troll back to</i> the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Davina</i>:
    </li>
    <li>If this <i>homies and palones</i> <i>troll</i> up to do <i>parker</i> in the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> at Jerusalem, then shall the <i>thumping cheat</i> of this <i>homies and palones</i> turn again unto their <i>Duchess</i>, even unto Rehoboam <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, and they shall <i>ferricadoza</i> me, and <i>troll</i> again to Rehoboam <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah.
    </li>
    <li>Whereupon the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>lelled</i> counsel, and made <i>dewey</i> calves of <i>gelt</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto them, It is too <i>dowry</i> for you to <i>troll</i> up to Jerusalem: <i>varda</i> thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> set the <i>una</i> in Bethel, and the other put <i>she</i> in Dan.
    </li>
    <li>And this <i>fakement</i> became a <i>kertever</i>: for the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>trolled</i> to worship before the <i>una</i>, even unto Dan.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> made an <i>lattie</i> of high places, and made <i>godly homies</i> of the lowest of the <i>homies and palones</i>, which were not of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Levi.
    </li>
    <li>And Jeroboam ordained a <i>dowry munjarlee</i> in the <i>otterth</i> month, on the fifteenth <i>journo</i> of the month, like unto the <i>dowry munjarlee</i> that is in Judah, and <i>she</i> offered upon the <i>grovelling fakement</i>. So did <i>she</i> in Bethel, sacrificing unto the calves that <i>she</i> had made: and <i>she</i> placed in Bethel the <i>godly homies</i> of the high places which <i>she</i> had made.
    </li>
    <li>So <i>she</i> offered upon the <i>grovelling fakement</i> which <i>she</i> had made in Bethel the fifteenth <i>journo</i> of the <i>otterth</i> month, even in the month which <i>she</i> had devised of <i>her</i> own <i>thumping cheat</i>; and ordained a <i>dowry munjarlee</i> unto the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel: and <i>she</i> offered upon the <i>grovelling fakement</i>, and burnt <i>smelly</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 13</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, there <i>trolled</i> a <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> out of Judah by the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the <i>grovelling fakement</i> to burn <i>smelly</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> against the <i>grovelling fakement</i> in the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, O <i>grovelling fakement</i>, <i>grovelling fakement</i>, thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>; <i>varda</i>, a <i>chavvie</i> shall be born unto the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Davina</i>, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall <i>she</i> offer the <i>godly homies</i> of the high places that burn <i>smelly</i> upon thee, and <i>homies</i>&#8216;s bones shall be burnt upon thee.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> a sign the same <i>journo</i>, <i>cackling</i>, This is the sign which the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>cackled</i>; <i>varda</i>, the <i>grovelling fakement</i> shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when <i>dowriest homie</i> Jeroboam <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>cackling</i> of the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, which had <i>screeched</i> against the <i>grovelling fakement</i> in Bethel, that <i>she</i> put forth <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> from the <i>grovelling fakement</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>lett</i> hold on <i>her</i>. And <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>, which <i>she</i> put forth against <i>her</i>, dried up, so that <i>she</i> could not pull it in again to <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>grovelling fakement</i> also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the <i>grovelling fakement</i>, according to the sign which the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> had <i>parkered</i> by the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> answered and <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, Intreat now the <i>eke</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i>, and pray for me, that my <i>famble</i> may be restored me again. And the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> besought the <i>Duchess</i>, and the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>famble</i> was restored <i>her</i> again, and became as it was before.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, <i>troll</i> home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will <i>parker</i> thee a <i>parkering</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>, If thou wilt <i>parker</i> me half thine <i>lattie</i>, I will not <i>troll</i> in with thee, <i>nishta</i> will I <i>jarry</i> <i>pannan</i> <i>nishta</i> <i>buvare</i> <i>aqua</i> in this place:
    </li>
    <li>For so was it charged me by the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>jarry</i> no <i>pannan</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>buvare</i> <i>aqua</i>, <i>nishta</i> turn again by the same way that thou camest.
    </li>
    <li>So <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> another way, and <i>trolled back</i> not by the way that <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> to Bethel.
    </li>
    <li>Now there <i>letted</i> an <i>badge</i> prophet in Bethel; and <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> <i>trolled</i> and <i>cackled</i> <i>her</i> all the works that the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> had done that <i>journo</i> in Bethel: the <i>lavs</i> which <i>she</i> had <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>, them they <i>cackled</i> also to their <i>Auntie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And their <i>Auntie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, What way <i>trolled</i> <i>she</i>? For <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> had <i>vardad</i> what way the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>trolled</i>, which <i>trolled</i> from Judah.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled <i>her</i> the ass: and <i>she</i> rode thereon,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>trolled</i> after the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and found <i>her</i> sitting under an oak: and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Art thou the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> that camest from Judah? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, I am.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>troll</i> home with me, and <i>jarry</i> <i>pannan</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, I may not return with thee, <i>nishta</i> <i>troll</i> in with thee: <i>nishta</i> will I <i>jarry</i> <i>pannan</i> <i>nishta</i> <i>buvare</i> <i>aqua</i> with thee in this place:
    </li>
    <li>For it was <i>cackled</i> to me by the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, Thou shalt <i>jarry</i> no <i>pannan</i> <i>nishta</i> <i>buvare</i> <i>aqua</i> there, <i>nishta</i> turn again to <i>troll</i> by the way that thou camest.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an <i>fairy</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me by the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> back with thee into thine <i>lattie</i>, that <i>she</i> may <i>jarry</i> <i>pannan</i> and <i>buvare</i> <i>aqua</i>. But <i>she</i> lied unto <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> back with <i>her</i>, and did <i>jarry</i> <i>pannan</i> in <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>, and drank <i>aqua</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, as they sat at the table, that the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> unto the prophet that brought <i>her</i> back:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> unto the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> that <i>trolled</i> from Judah, <i>cackling</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the <i>screech</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and hast not kept the <i>butch lav</i> which the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> commanded thee,
    </li>
    <li>But camest back, and hast <i>jarried</i> <i>pannan</i> and <i>bevvied</i> <i>aqua</i> in the place, of the which the <i>Duchess</i> did <i>cackle</i> to thee, <i>jarry</i> no <i>pannan</i>, and <i>buvare</i> no <i>aqua</i>; thy carcase shall not <i>troll</i> unto the sepulchre of thy <i>aunties</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, after <i>she</i> had <i>jarried</i> <i>pannan</i>, and after <i>she</i> had <i>bevvied</i>, that <i>she</i> saddled for <i>her</i> the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom <i>she</i> had brought back.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> was <i>trolled</i>, a lion met <i>her</i> by the way, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> <i>her</i>: and <i>her</i> carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by the carcase.
    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, <i>homies</i> <i>trolled by</i>, and <i>vardad</i> the carcase cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcase: and they <i>trolled</i> and <i>cackled</i> it in the <i>smoke</i> where the <i>badge</i> prophet <i>letted</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when the prophet that brought <i>her</i> back from the way <i>aunt nelled</i> thereof, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, It is the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, who was disobedient unto the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>: therefore the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> unto the lion, which hath torn <i>her</i>, and <i>ferricadoozed</i> <i>her</i>, according to the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, which <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> to <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> and found <i>her</i> carcase cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not <i>jarried</i> the carcase, <i>nishta</i> torn the ass.
    </li>
    <li>And the prophet <i>lelled</i> up the carcase of the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and <i>laued</i> it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the <i>badge</i> prophet <i>trolled</i> to the <i>smoke</i>, to mourn and to bury <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> carcase in <i>her</i> own grave; and they mourned over <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Alas, my <i>sister</i>!
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, after <i>she</i> had buried <i>her</i>, that <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> to <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>, <i>cackling</i>, When I am <i>stiff</i>, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> is buried; <i>lett</i> my bones beside <i>her</i> bones:
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>cackling</i> which <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> by the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> against the <i>grovelling fakement</i> in Bethel, and against all the <i>latties</i> of the high places which are in the <i>smokes</i> of Samaria, shall surely <i>troll</i> to pass.
    </li>
    <li>After this <i>fakement</i> Jeroboam <i>trolled back</i> not from <i>her</i> <i>nana</i> way, but made again of the lowest of the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>godly homies</i> of the high places: whosoever would, <i>she</i> consecrated <i>her</i>, and <i>she</i> became <i>una</i> of the <i>godly homies</i> of the high places.
    </li>
    <li>And this <i>fakement</i> became <i>kertever</i> unto the <i>lattie</i> of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to <i>battyfang</i> it from off the <i>eke</i> of the earth.

    <h2>Chapter 14</h2>

    <li>At that time Abijah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jeroboam fell sick.

    <li>And Jeroboam <i>cackled</i> to <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the <i>palone affair</i> of Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh: <i>varda</i>, there is Ahijah the prophet, which <i>cackled</i> me that I should be <i>dowriest homie</i> over this <i>homies and palones</i>.

    <li>And <i>lell</i> with thee <i>dacha</i> loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and <i>troll</i> to <i>her</i>: <i>she</i> shall <i>cackle</i> thee what shall become of the <i>chavvie</i>.

    <li>And Jeroboam&#8217;s <i>palone affair</i> did so, and arose, and <i>trolled</i> to Shiloh, and <i>trolled</i> to the <i>lattie</i> of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not <i>varda</i>; for <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i> were set by reason of <i>her</i> age.

    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Ahijah, <i>varda</i>, the <i>palone affair</i> of Jeroboam <i>trolleth</i> to ask a <i>fakement</i> of thee for her <i>homie chavvie</i>; for <i>she</i> is sick: thus and thus shalt thou <i>cackle</i> unto her: for it shall be, when she <i>trolleth</i> in, that she shall feign herself to be another <i>palone</i>.

    <li>And it was so, when Ahijah <i>aunt nelled</i> the sound of her <i>plates</i>, as she <i>trolled</i> in at the door, that <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>troll</i> in, thou <i>palone affair</i> of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am <i>laued</i> to thee with heavy tidings.

    <li><i>Troll</i>, <i>cackle</i> Jeroboam, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the <i>homies and palones</i>, and made thee <i>princess</i> over my <i>homies and palones</i> Israel,
    </li>
    <li>And rent the kingdom away from the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Davina</i>, and <i>parkered</i> it thee: and yet thou hast not been as my <i>serving homie</i> <i>Davina</i>, who kept my <i>butch lavs</i>, and who <i>trolled after</i> me with all <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>, to do that only which was <i>sweet</i> in mine <i>ogles</i>;
    </li>
    <li>But hast done <i>nana</i> above all that were before thee: for thou hast <i>trolled</i> and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to <i>wild</i>, and hast cast me behind thy back:
    </li>
    <li>Therefore, <i>varda</i>, I will <i>parker</i> <i>nana</i> upon the <i>lattie</i> of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam <i>her</i> that pisseth against the wall, and <i>her</i> that is shut up and <i>dry</i> in Israel, and will <i>lell</i> away the remnant of the <i>lattie</i> of Jeroboam, as a <i>homie</i> <i>lelleth</i> away dung, till it be all <i>trolled</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Her</i> that <i>carketh it</i> of Jeroboam in the <i>smoke</i> shall the <i>women who are not conventionally attractive</i> <i>jarry</i>; and <i>her</i> that <i>carketh it</i> in the field shall the fowls of the air <i>jarry</i>: for the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>cackled</i> it.
    </li>
    <li>Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own <i>lattie</i>: and when thy <i>plates</i> enter into the <i>smoke</i>, the <i>chavvie</i> shall <i>cark it</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And all Israel shall mourn for <i>her</i>, and bury <i>her</i>: for <i>she</i> only of Jeroboam shall <i>troll</i> to the grave, because in <i>her</i> there is found some <i>bona</i> <i>fakement</i> toward the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel in the <i>lattie</i> of Jeroboam.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover the <i>Duchess</i> shall raise <i>her</i> up a <i>dowriest homie</i> over Israel, who shall cut off the <i>lattie</i> of Jeroboam that <i>journo</i>: but what? even now.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>Duchess</i> shall <i>slap</i> Israel, as a reed is shaken in the <i>aqua</i>, and <i>she</i> shall root up Israel out of this <i>bona</i> land, which <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> to their <i>aunties</i>, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the <i>Duchess</i> to <i>wild</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> shall <i>parker</i> Israel up because of the <i>kertervers</i> of Jeroboam, who did <i>kertever</i>, and who made Israel to <i>kertever</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Jeroboam&#8217;s <i>palone affair</i> arose, and <i>trolled off</i>, and <i>trolled</i> to Tirzah: and when she <i>trolled</i> to the threshold of the door, the <i>chavvie</i> <i>carked it</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And they buried <i>her</i>; and all Israel mourned for <i>her</i>, according to the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, which <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> by the <i>famble</i> of <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i> Ahijah the prophet.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>lettie</i> of the acts of Jeroboam, how <i>she</i> warred, and how <i>she</i> reigned, <i>varda</i>, they are <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the chronicles of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And the days which Jeroboam reigned were <i>dewey</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i> years: and <i>she</i> <i>lettied</i> with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>, and Nadab <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> reigned in <i>her</i> stead.
    </li>
    <li>And Rehoboam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was <i>quarter dacha</i> and <i>una</i> years <i>badge</i> when <i>she</i> began to reign, and <i>she</i> reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the <i>smoke</i> which the <i>Duchess</i> did choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put <i>her</i> name there. And <i>her</i> mother&#8217;s name was Naamah an Ammonitess.
    </li>
    <li>And Judah did <i>nana</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and they provoked <i>her</i> to jealousy with their <i>kertervers</i> which they had committed, above all that their <i>aunties</i> had done.
    </li>
    <li>For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree.
    </li>
    <li>And there were also <i>homie palones</i> in the land: and they did according to all the <i>dowry cods</i> of the nations which the <i>Duchess</i> cast out before the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> in the fifth year of <i>dowriest homie</i> Rehoboam, that Shishak <i>dowriest homie</i> of Egypt <i>trolled</i> up against Jerusalem:

    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> away the <i>gelt</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and the <i>gelt</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>; <i>she</i> even <i>lelled</i> away all: and <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> away all the shields of <i>gelt</i> which Solomon had made.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>dowriest homie</i> Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and committed them unto the <i>fambles</i> of the <i>dowriest</i> of the <i>charpering homie</i>, which kept the door of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And it was so, when the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>trolled</i> into the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, that the <i>charpering homie</i> bare them, and brought them back into the <i>charpering homie</i> <i>booth</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now the <i>lettie</i> of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that <i>she</i> did, are they not <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the chronicles of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Judah?
    </li>
    <li>And there was <i>barney</i> between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.
    </li>
    <li>And Rehoboam <i>lettied</i> with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>, and was buried with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i> in the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i>. And <i>her</i> mother&#8217;s name was Naamah an Ammonitess. And Abijam <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> reigned in <i>her</i> stead.

    <li>Now in the eighteenth year of <i>dowriest homie</i> Jeroboam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nebat reigned Abijam over Judah.

    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>minced</i> in all the <i>kertervers</i> of <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, which <i>she</i> had done before <i>her</i>: and <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> was not <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i> with the <i>Duchess</i> <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i>, as the <i>thumping cheat</i> of <i>Davina</i> <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> for <i>Davina</i>&#8216;s sake did the <i>Duchess</i> <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i> <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> a <i>binco</i> in Jerusalem, to set up <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> after <i>her</i>, and to establish Jerusalem:
    </li>
    <li>Because <i>Davina</i> did that which was <i>sweet</i> in the <i>ogles</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and turned not aside from any <i>fakement</i> that <i>she</i> commanded <i>her</i> all the days of <i>her</i> life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.
    </li>
    <li>And there was <i>barney</i> between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of <i>her</i> life.
    </li>
    <li>Now the <i>lettie</i> of the acts of Abijam, and all that <i>she</i> did, are they not <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the chronicles of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Judah? And there was <i>barney</i> between Abijam and Jeroboam.

    <li>And Abijam <i>lettied</i> with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>; and they buried <i>her</i> in the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i>: and Asa <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> reigned in <i>her</i> stead.
    </li>
    <li>And in the <i>dewey dachath</i> year of Jeroboam <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel reigned Asa over Judah.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>quarter dacha</i> and <i>una</i> years reigned <i>she</i> in Jerusalem. And <i>her</i> mother&#8217;s name was Maachah, the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Abishalom.
    </li>
    <li>And Asa did that which was <i>sweet</i> in the <i>ogles</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, as did <i>Davina</i> <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> away the <i>homie palones</i> out of the land, and removed all the idols that <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i> had made.
    </li>
    <li>And also Maachah <i>her</i> mother, even her <i>she</i> removed from being <i>dowriest palone</i>, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa <i>battyfanged</i> her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.
    </li>
    <li>But the high places were not removed: <i>any road up</i> Asa&#8217;s <i>thumping cheat</i> was <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i> with the <i>Duchess</i> all <i>her</i> days.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> brought in the <i>fakements</i> which <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> had dedicated, and the <i>fakements</i> which himself had dedicated, into the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, silver, and <i>gelt</i>, and <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And there was <i>barney</i> between Asa and Baasha <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel all their days.
    </li>
    <li>And Baasha <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel <i>trolled</i> up against Judah, and built Ramah, that <i>she</i> might not suffer any to <i>troll out</i> or <i>troll</i> in to Asa <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah.
    </li>
    <li>Then Asa <i>lelled</i> all the silver and the <i>gelt</i> that were <i>dry</i> in the <i>gelt</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and the <i>gelt</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, and <i>laued</i> them into the <i>famble</i> of <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>: and <i>dowriest homie</i> Asa <i>laued</i> them to Benhadad, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Tabrimon, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Hezion, <i>dowriest homie</i> of Syria, that <i>letted</i> at Damascus, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>There is a league between me and thee, and between my <i>Auntie</i> and thy <i>Auntie</i>: <i>varda</i>, I have <i>laued</i> unto thee a present of silver and <i>gelt</i>; <i>troll</i> and break thy league with Baasha <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel, that <i>she</i> may <i>sling yer hook</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So Benhadad <i>aunt nelled</i> unto <i>dowriest homie</i> Asa, and <i>laued</i> the captains of the hosts which <i>she</i> had against the <i>smokes</i> of Israel, and <i>slapped</i> Ijon, and Dan, and Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when Baasha <i>aunt nelled</i> thereof, that <i>she</i> <i>dry</i> off building of Ramah, and <i>letted</i> in Tirzah.

    <li>Then <i>dowriest homie</i> Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none was exempted: and they <i>lelled</i> away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and <i>dowriest homie</i> Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.

    <li>The <i>lettie</i> of all the acts of Asa, and all <i>her</i> might, and all that <i>she</i> did, and the <i>smokes</i> which <i>she</i> built, are they not <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the chronicles of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Judah? <i>any road up</i> in the time of <i>her</i> <i>badgeness</i> <i>she</i> was diseased in <i>her</i> <i>plates</i>.

    <li>And Asa <i>lettied</i> with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>, and was buried with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i> in the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i> <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>: and Jehoshaphat <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> reigned in <i>her</i> stead.

    <li>And Nadab the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, and reigned over Israel <i>dewey</i> years.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> did <i>nana</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>minced</i> in the way of <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, and in <i>her</i> <i>kertever</i> wherewith <i>she</i> made Israel to <i>kertever</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Baasha the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ahijah, of the <i>lattie</i> of Issachar, conspired against <i>her</i>; and Baasha <i>slapped</i> <i>her</i> at Gibbethon, which belonged to the <i>naffs</i>; for Nadab and all Israel <i>laued</i> siege to Gibbethon.
    </li>
    <li>Even in the third year of Asa <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah did Baasha <i>ferricadooza</i> <i>her</i>, and reigned in <i>her</i> stead.

    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when <i>she</i> reigned, that <i>she</i> <i>slapped</i> all the <i>lattie</i> of Jeroboam; <i>she</i> <i>dry</i> not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until <i>she</i> had <i>battyfanged</i> <i>her</i>, according unto the <i>cackling</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, which <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> by <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i> Ahijah the Shilonite:

    <li>Now the <i>lettie</i> of the acts of Nadab, and all that <i>she</i> did, are they not <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the chronicles of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Israel?
    </li>
    <li>And there was <i>barney</i> between Asa and Baasha <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel all their days.
    </li>
    <li>In the third year of Asa <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah began Baasha the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, <i>dewey dacha</i> and <i>quarter</i> years.

    <h2>Chapter 16</h2>

    <li>Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee <i>princess</i> over my <i>homies and palones</i> Israel; and thou hast <i>minced</i> in the way of Jeroboam, and hast made my <i>homies and palones</i> Israel to <i>kertever</i>, to provoke me to <i>wild</i> with their <i>kertervers</i>;
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, I will <i>lell</i> away the posterity of Baasha, and the posterity of <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>; and will make thy <i>lattie</i> like the <i>lattie</i> of Jeroboam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nebat.

    <li>Now the <i>lettie</i> of the acts of Baasha, and what <i>she</i> did, and <i>her</i> might, are they not <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the chronicles of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Israel?
    </li>
    <li>So Baasha <i>lettied</i> with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> reigned in <i>her</i> stead.
    </li>
    <li>And also by the <i>famble</i> of the prophet Jehu the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Hanani <i>trolled</i> the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> against Baasha, and against <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>, even for all the <i>nana</i> that <i>she</i> did in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, in provoking <i>her</i> to <i>wild</i> with the <i>acting dickey</i> of <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i>, in being like the <i>lattie</i> of Jeroboam; and because <i>she</i> <i>ferricadozad</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>In the <i>dewey dacha</i> and <i>seyth</i> year of Asa <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah began Elah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, <i>dewey</i> years.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i> Zimri, captain of half <i>her</i> <i>rattling coves</i>, conspired against <i>her</i>, as <i>she</i> was in Tirzah, <i>bevvying</i> himself <i>bevvied</i> in the <i>lattie</i> of Arza steward of <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i> in Tirzah.
    </li>
    <li>And Zimri <i>trolled</i> in and <i>slapped</i> <i>her</i>, and <i>ferricadozad</i> <i>her</i>, in the <i>dewey dacha</i> and <i>setterth</i> year of Asa <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, and reigned in <i>her</i> stead.

    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when <i>she</i> began to reign, as soon as <i>she</i> sat on <i>her</i> throne, that <i>she</i> <i>ferricadoozaed</i> all the <i>lattie</i> of Baasha: <i>she</i> <i>dry</i> <i>her</i> not <i>una</i> that pisseth against a wall, <i>nishta</i> of <i>her</i> kinsfolks, <i>nishta</i> of <i>her</i> <i>bencoves</i>.

    <li>Thus did Zimri <i>battyfang</i> all the <i>lattie</i> of Baasha, according to the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, which <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> against Baasha by Jehu the prophet.

    <li>Now the <i>lettie</i> of the acts of Elah, and all that <i>she</i> did, are they not <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the chronicles of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Israel?
    </li>
    <li>In the <i>dewey dacha</i> and <i>setterth</i> year of Asa <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah did Zimri reign <i>setter</i> days in Tirzah. And the <i>homies and palones</i> were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the <i>naffs</i>.

    <li>And the <i>homies and palones</i> that were encamped <i>aunt nelled</i> <i>cackle</i>, Zimri hath conspired, and hath also <i>ferricadoozed</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>: wherefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, <i>dowriest homie</i> over Israel that <i>journo</i> in the camp.

    <li>Then were the <i>homies and palones</i> of Israel <i>medzered</i> into <i>dewey</i> parts: half of the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>trolled after</i> Tibni the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ginath, to make <i>her</i> <i>dowriest homie</i>; and half <i>trolled after</i> Omri.

    <li>In the <i>trey dacha</i> and first year of Asa <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, <i>kenza</i> years: <i>sey</i> years reigned <i>she</i> in Tirzah.

    <li>And <i>she</i> bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for <i>dewey</i> talents of silver, and built on the hill, and <i>screeched</i> the name of the <i>smoke</i> which <i>she</i> built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.

    <li>But Omri wrought <i>nana</i> in the <i>ogles</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and did worse than all that were before <i>her</i>.

    <li>For <i>she</i> <i>minced</i> in all the way of Jeroboam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nebat, and in <i>her</i> <i>kertever</i> wherewith <i>she</i> made Israel to <i>kertever</i>, to provoke the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel to <i>wild</i> with their <i>spanglies</i>.

    <li>And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel to <i>wild</i> than all the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Israel that were before <i>her</i>.

    <li>In <i>her</i> days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> the foundation thereof in Abiram <i>her</i> firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in <i>her</i> youngest <i>homie chavvie</i> Segub, according to the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, which <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> by Joshua the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nun.

    <li>And the ravens brought <i>her</i> <i>pannan</i> and flesh in the morning, and <i>pannan</i> and flesh in the <i>bijou nochy</i>; and <i>she</i> drank of the brook.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and <i>lett</i> there: <i>varda</i>, I have commanded a widow <i>palone</i> there to sustain thee.
    </li>
    <li>So <i>she</i> arose and <i>trolled</i> to Zarephath. And when <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> to the gate of the <i>smoke</i>, <i>varda</i>, the widow <i>palone</i> was there gathering of sticks: and <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> to her, and <i>cackled</i>, Fetch me, I pray thee, a <i>bijou</i> <i>aqua</i> in a <i>fakement</i>, that I may <i>buvare</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And as she was going to fetch it, <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> to her, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>parker</i> me, I pray thee, a morsel of <i>pannan</i> in thine <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And she <i>cackled</i>, As the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> <i>letteth</i>, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a <i>bijou</i> <i>lube</i> in a cruse: and, <i>varda</i>, I am gathering <i>dewey</i> sticks, that I may <i>troll</i> in and dress it for me and my <i>homie chavvie</i>, that we may <i>jarry</i> it, and <i>cark it</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Elijah <i>cackled</i> unto her, Fear not; <i>troll</i> and do as thou hast <i>cackled</i>: but make me thereof a <i>bijou</i> cake first, and <i>parker</i> it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy <i>homie chavvie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, <i>nishta</i> shall the cruse of <i>lube</i> fail, until the <i>journo</i> that the <i>Duchess</i> sendeth rain upon the earth.
    </li>
    <li>And she <i>trolled</i> and did according to the <i>cackling</i> of Elijah: and she, and <i>she</i>, and her <i>lattie</i>, did <i>jarry</i> many days.
    </li>
    <li>And the barrel of meal wasted not, <i>nishta</i> did the cruse of <i>lube</i> fail, according to the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, which <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> by Elijah.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> after these <i>fakements</i>, that the <i>homie chavvie</i> of the <i>palone</i>, the mistress of the <i>lattie</i>, fell sick; and <i>her</i> <i>kerterver coddy</i> was so sore, that there was no breath <i>dry</i> in <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And she <i>cackled</i> unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>? art thou <i>troll</i> unto me to <i>screech</i> my <i>kertever</i> to remembrance, and to <i>ferricadooza</i> my <i>homie chavvie</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto her, <i>parker</i> me thy <i>homie chavvie</i>. And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> out of her bosom, and <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> up into a loft, where <i>she</i> <i>letted</i>, and <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> upon <i>her</i> own bed.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, O <i>Duchess</i> my <i>Gloria</i>, hast thou also brought <i>nana</i> upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her <i>homie chavvie</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> stretched himself upon the <i>chavvie</i> <i>trey</i> times, and <i>screeched</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, O <i>Duchess</i> my <i>Gloria</i>, I pray thee, let this <i>chavvie</i>&#8216;s <i>nishta lucoddy</i> <i>troll</i> into <i>her</i> again.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>cackling fakement</i> of Elijah; and the <i>nishta lucoddy</i> of the <i>chavvie</i> <i>trolled</i> into <i>her</i> again, and <i>she</i> revived.
    </li>
    <li>And Elijah <i>lelled</i> the <i>chavvie</i>, and brought <i>her</i> down out of the <i>booth</i> into the <i>lattie</i>, and <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> unto <i>her</i> mother: and Elijah <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, thy <i>homie chavvie</i> <i>letteth</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>palone</i> <i>cackled</i> to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art a <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and that the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> in thy <i>screech</i> is truth.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 18</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> after many days, that the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> to Elijah in the third year, <i>cackling</i>, <i>troll</i>, shew thyself unto Ahab; and I will <i>lau</i> rain upon the earth.
    </li>
    <li>And Elijah <i>trolled</i> to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a sore <i>nix munjarlee</i> in Samaria.
    </li>
    <li>And Ahab <i>screeched</i> Obadiah, which was the governor of <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>. (Now Obadiah feared the <i>Duchess</i> greatly:
    </li>
    <li>For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the <i>Duchess</i>, that Obadiah <i>lelled</i> an <i>chenter</i> prophets, and hid them by <i>chinker dacha</i> in a cave, and fed them with <i>pannan</i> and <i>aqua</i>. )
    </li>
    <li>And Ahab <i>cackled</i> unto Obadiah, <i>troll</i> into the land, unto all fountains of <i>aqua</i>, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.
    </li>
    <li>So they <i>medzered</i> the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab <i>trolled</i> <i>una</i> way by himself, and Obadiah <i>trolled</i> another way by himself.
    </li>
    <li>And as Obadiah was in the way, <i>varda</i>, Elijah met <i>her</i>: and <i>she</i> knew <i>her</i>, and fell on <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Art thou that my <i>Duchess</i> Elijah?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> answered <i>her</i>, I am: <i>troll</i>, <i>cackle</i> thy <i>Duchess</i>, <i>varda</i>, Elijah is here.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, What have I <i>kertervered</i>, that thou wouldest deliver thy <i>serving homie</i> into the <i>famble</i> of Ahab, to <i>ferricadooza</i> me?
    </li>
    <li>As the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> <i>letteth</i>, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my <i>Duchess</i> hath not <i>laued</i> to <i>charper</i> thee: and when they <i>cackled</i>, <i>she</i> is not there; <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.
    </li>
    <li>And now thou <i>cackleth</i>, <i>troll</i>, <i>cackle</i> thy <i>Duchess</i>, <i>varda</i>, Elijah is here.
    </li>
    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, as soon as I am <i>trolled</i> from thee, that the <i>Fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> shall carry thee whither I know not; and so when I <i>troll</i> and <i>cackle</i> Ahab, and <i>she</i> cannot find thee, <i>she</i> shall <i>ferricadooza</i> me: but I thy <i>serving homie</i> fear the <i>Duchess</i> from my <i>beandom</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Was it not <i>cackled</i> my <i>Duchess</i> what I did when Jezebel <i>ferricadoozaed</i> the prophets of the <i>Duchess</i>, how I hid an <i>chenter</i> <i>homies</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s prophets by <i>chinker dacha</i> in a cave, and fed them with <i>pannan</i> and <i>aqua</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And now thou <i>cackleth</i>, <i>troll</i>, <i>cackle</i> thy <i>Duchess</i>, <i>varda</i>, Elijah is here: and <i>she</i> shall <i>ferricadooza</i> me.
    </li>
    <li>And Elijah <i>cackled</i>, As the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts <i>letteth</i>, before whom I stand, I will surely shew myself unto <i>her</i> to <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So Obadiah <i>trolled</i> to meet Ahab, and <i>cackled</i> <i>her</i>: and Ahab <i>trolled</i> to meet Elijah.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when Ahab <i>vardad</i> Elijah, that Ahab <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Art thou <i>she</i> that troubleth Israel?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, in that ye have forsaken the <i>butch lavs</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and thou hast <i>trolled after</i> Baalim.
    </li>
    <li>Now therefore <i>lau</i>, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal <i>quarter</i> <i>chenter</i> and <i>chinker dacha</i>, and the prophets of the groves <i>quarter</i> <i>chenter</i>, which <i>jarry</i> at Jezebel&#8217;s table.
    </li>
    <li>So Ahab <i>laued</i> unto all the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.
    </li>
    <li>And Elijah <i>trolled</i> unto all the <i>homies and palones</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, How long halt ye between <i>dewey</i> opinions? if the <i>Duchess</i> be <i>Gloria</i>, <i>troll after</i> <i>her</i>: but if Baal, then <i>troll after</i> <i>her</i>. And the <i>homies and palones</i> answered <i>her</i> not a <i>lav</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> Elijah unto the <i>homies and palones</i>, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the <i>Duchess</i>; but Baal&#8217;s prophets are <i>quarter</i> <i>chenter</i> and <i>chinker dacha</i> <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Let them therefore <i>parker</i> us <i>dewey</i> bullocks; and let them choose <i>una</i> bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and <i>lett</i> it on wood, and put no <i>binco fakement</i> under: and I will dress the other bullock, and <i>lett</i> it on wood, and put no <i>binco fakement</i> under:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>screech</i> ye on the name of your gods, and I will <i>screech</i> on the name of the <i>Duchess</i>: and the <i>Gloria</i> that answereth by <i>binco fakement</i>, let <i>her</i> be <i>Gloria</i>. And all the <i>homies and palones</i> answered and <i>cackled</i>, It is well <i>cackled</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Elijah <i>cackled</i> unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you <i>una</i> bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and <i>screech</i> on the name of your gods, but put no <i>binco fakement</i> under.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>lelled</i> the bullock which was <i>parkered</i> them, and they <i>zhooshed</i> it, and <i>screeched</i> on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, <i>cackling</i>, O Baal, <i>aunt nell</i> us. But there was no <i>cackling fakement</i>, <i>nishta</i> any that answered. And they leaped upon the <i>grovelling fakement</i> which was made.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>screech</i> aloud: for <i>she</i> is a <i>Gloria</i>; either <i>she</i> is talking, or <i>she</i> is pursuing, or <i>she</i> is in a journey, or peradventure <i>she</i> sleepeth, and must be awaked.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>screeched</i> aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with <i>efinks</i> and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the <i>parkering</i> of the <i>bijou nochy</i> <i>parker</i>, that there was <i>nishta</i> <i>cackling fakement</i>, <i>nishta</i> any to answer, <i>nishta</i> any that regarded.
    </li>
    <li>And Elijah <i>cackled</i> unto all the <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>troll</i> near unto me. And all the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>trolled</i> near unto <i>her</i>. And <i>she</i> repaired the <i>grovelling fakement</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> that was broken down.
    </li>
    <li>And Elijah <i>lelled</i> <i>kenza</i> stones, according to the number of the tribes of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Jacob, unto whom the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Israel shall be thy name:
    </li>
    <li>And with the stones <i>she</i> built an <i>grovelling fakement</i> in the name of the <i>Duchess</i>: and <i>she</i> made a trench about the <i>grovelling fakement</i>, as <i>dowry</i> as would contain <i>dewey</i> measures of <i>maria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> on the wood, and <i>cackled</i>, Fill <i>quarter</i> barrels with <i>aqua</i>, and pour it on the burnt <i>parker</i>, and on the wood.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>aqua</i> ran round about the <i>grovelling fakement</i>; and <i>she</i> filled the trench also with <i>aqua</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> at the time of the <i>parkering</i> of the <i>bijou nochy</i> <i>parker</i>, that Elijah the prophet <i>trolled</i> near, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this <i>journo</i> that thou art <i>Gloria</i> in Israel, and that I am thy <i>serving homie</i>, and that I have done all these <i>fakements</i> at thy <i>lav</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Aunt nell</i> me, O <i>Duchess</i>, <i>aunt nell</i> me, that this <i>homies and palones</i> may know that thou art the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>, and that thou hast turned their <i>thumping cheat</i> back again.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>binco fakement</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> fell, and consumed the burnt <i>parker</i>, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the <i>aqua</i> that was in the trench.
    </li>
    <li>And when all the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>vardad</i> it, they fell on their <i>ekes</i>: and they <i>cackled</i>, The <i>Duchess</i>, <i>she</i> is the <i>Gloria</i>; the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>she</i> is the <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Elijah <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>lell</i> the prophets of Baal; let not <i>una</i> of them escape. And they <i>lelled</i> them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> them there.
    </li>
    <li>And Elijah <i>cackled</i> unto Ahab, Get thee up, <i>jarry</i> and <i>buvare</i>; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.
    </li>
    <li>So Ahab <i>trolled</i> up to <i>jarry</i> and to <i>buvare</i>. And Elijah <i>trolled</i> up to the top of Carmel; and <i>she</i> cast himself down upon the earth, and put <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> between <i>her</i> knees,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackled</i> to <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i>, <i>troll</i> up now, <i>varda</i> toward the sea. And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> up, and looked, and <i>cackled</i>, There is <i>nishter</i>. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>troll</i> again <i>setter</i> times.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> at the <i>setterth</i> time, that <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, there ariseth a <i>bijou</i> cloud out of the sea, like a <i>homie</i>&#8216;s <i>famble</i>. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>troll</i> up, <i>cackle</i> unto Ahab, Prepare thy <i>trundling cheat</i>, and get thee down that the rain stop thee not.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> in the mean while, that the heaven was <i>goolie</i> with clouds and wind, and there was a <i>dowry</i> rain. And Ahab rode, and <i>trolled</i> to Jezreel.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>famble</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> was on Elijah; and <i>she</i> girded up <i>her</i> loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 19</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And Ahab <i>cackled</i> Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how <i>she</i> had <i>ferricadoozed</i> all the prophets with the <i>dowry efink</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then Jezebel <i>laued</i> a messenger unto Elijah, <i>cackling</i>, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of <i>una</i> of them by to morrow about this time.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> that, <i>she</i> arose, and <i>trolled</i> for <i>her</i> life, and <i>trolled</i> to Beersheba, which belongeth to Judah, and <i>dry</i> <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i> there.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> himself <i>trolled</i> a <i>journo</i>&#8216;s journey into the <i>nishta smoke</i>, and <i>trolled</i> and sat down under a juniper tree: and <i>she</i> requested for himself that <i>she</i> might <i>cark it</i>; and <i>cackled</i>, It is enough; now, O <i>Duchess</i>, <i>lell</i> away my life; for I am not <i>benar</i> than my <i>aunties</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And as <i>she</i> <i>lett</i> and <i>lettied</i> under a juniper tree, <i>varda</i>, then an <i>fairy</i> <i>reefed</i> <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Arise and <i>jarry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> looked, and, <i>varda</i>, there was a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of <i>aqua</i> at <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>. And <i>she</i> did <i>jarry</i> and <i>buvare</i>, and <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> down again.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> again the second time, and <i>reefed</i> <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Arise and <i>jarry</i>; because the journey is too <i>dowry</i> for thee.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> arose, and did <i>jarry</i> and <i>buvare</i>, and <i>trolled</i> in the <i>butchness</i> of that <i>carnish</i> <i>quarter dacha</i> days and <i>quarter dacha</i> nights unto Horeb the mount of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, <i>varda</i>, the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> to <i>her</i>, and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, What doest thou here, Elijah?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, I have been <i>dowry</i> jealous for the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of hosts: for the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and <i>ferricadoozed</i> thy prophets with the <i>dowry efink</i>; and I, even I only, am <i>dry</i>; and they <i>charper</i> my life, to <i>lell</i> it away.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>troll forth</i>, and stand upon the mount before the <i>Duchess</i>. And, <i>varda</i>, the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled by</i>, and a <i>dowry</i> and <i>butch</i> wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the <i>Duchess</i>; but the <i>Duchess</i> was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the <i>Duchess</i> was not in the earthquake:
    </li>
    <li>And after the earthquake a <i>binco fakement</i>; but the <i>Duchess</i> was not in the <i>binco fakement</i>: and after the <i>binco fakement</i> a still <i>pogey</i> <i>cackling fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And it was so, when Elijah <i>aunt nelled</i> it, that <i>she</i> wrapped <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> in <i>her</i> mantle, and <i>trolled</i> out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, <i>varda</i>, there <i>trolled</i> a <i>cackling fakement</i> unto <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, What doest thou here, Elijah?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, I have been <i>dowry</i> jealous for the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of hosts: because the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and <i>ferricadoozed</i> thy prophets with the <i>dowry efink</i>; and I, even I only, am <i>dry</i>; and they <i>charper</i> my life, to <i>lell</i> it away.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>troll</i>, return on thy way to the <i>nishta smoke</i> of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be <i>dowriest homie</i> over Syria:
    </li>
    <li>And Jehu the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be <i>dowriest homie</i> over Israel: and Elisha the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.
    </li>
    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, that <i>her</i> that escapeth the <i>dowry efink</i> of Hazael shall Jehu <i>ferricadooza</i>: and <i>her</i> that escapeth from the <i>dowry efink</i> of Jehu shall Elisha <i>ferricadooza</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Yet I have <i>dry</i> me <i>setter</i> <i>mille</i> in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every <i>screech</i> which hath not kissed <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So <i>she</i> <i>trolled off</i> thence, and found Elisha the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Shaphat, who was plowing with <i>kenza</i> yoke of oxen before <i>her</i>, and <i>she</i> with the twelfth: and Elijah <i>trolled by</i> <i>her</i>, and cast <i>her</i> mantle upon <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>dry</i> the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and <i>cackled</i>, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my <i>Auntie</i> and my mother, and then I will <i>troll after</i> thee. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>troll</i> back again: for what have I done to thee?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled back</i> back from <i>her</i>, and <i>lelled</i> a yoke of oxen, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and <i>parkered</i> unto the <i>homies and palones</i>, and they did <i>jarry</i>.

    <h2>Chapter 20</h2>

    <li>And Benhadad the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Syria gathered all <i>her</i> host together: and there were <i>trey dacha</i> and <i>dewey</i> <i>dowriest homies</i> with <i>her</i>, and horses, and <i>rattling coves</i>; and <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> messengers to Ahab <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel into the <i>smoke</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> Benhadad,

    <li>Thy silver and thy <i>gelt</i> is mine; thy <i>palone affairs</i> also and thy <i>chavvies</i>, even the goodliest, are mine.

    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel answered and <i>cackled</i>, My <i>Duchess</i>, O <i>dowriest homie</i>, according to thy <i>cackling</i>, I am thine, and all that I have.

    <li>And the messengers <i>trolled</i> again, and <i>cackled</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> Benhadad, <i>cackling</i>, Although I have <i>laued</i> unto thee, <i>cackling</i>, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy <i>gelt</i>, and thy <i>palone affairs</i>, and thy <i>chavvies</i>;

    <li>Then the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel <i>screeched</i> all the <i>fungi</i> of the land, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>Marcia</i>, I pray you, and <i>varda</i> how this <i>homie</i> <i>charpereth</i> mischief: for <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> unto me for my <i>palone affairs</i>, and for my <i>chavvies</i>, and for my silver, and for my <i>gelt</i>; and I denied <i>her</i> not.

    <li>And all the <i>fungi</i> and all the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>aunt nell</i> not unto <i>her</i>, <i>nishta</i> consent.

    <li>Wherefore <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto the messengers of Benhadad, <i>cackle</i> my <i>Duchess</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>, All that thou didst <i>lau</i> for to thy <i>serving homie</i> at the first I will do: but this <i>fakement</i> I may not do. And the messengers <i>trolled off</i>, and brought <i>her</i> <i>lav</i> again.
    </li>
    <li>And Benhadad <i>laued</i> unto <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the <i>homies and palones</i> that <i>troll after</i> me.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel answered and <i>cackled</i>, <i>cackle</i> <i>her</i>, Let not <i>her</i> that girdeth on <i>her</i> harness boast himself as <i>she</i> that <i>laueth</i> it off.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when Ben-hadad <i>aunt nelled</i> this message, as <i>she</i> was <i>bevvying</i>, <i>she</i> and the <i>dowriest homies</i> in the pavilions, that <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>, Set yourselves in array. And they set themselves in array against the <i>smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, there <i>trolled</i> a prophet unto Ahab <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel, <i>cackling</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, Hast thou <i>vardad</i> all this <i>dowry</i> multitude? <i>varda</i>, I will deliver it into thine <i>famble</i> this <i>journo</i>; and thou shalt know that I am the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Ahab <i>cackled</i>, By whom? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, Even by the <i>bean coves</i> of the <i>princesses</i> of the provinces. Then <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Who shall order the battle? And <i>she</i> answered, Thou.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>she</i> numbered the <i>bean coves</i> of the <i>princesses</i> of the provinces, and they were <i>dewey</i> <i>chenter</i> and <i>trey dacha</i> <i>dewey</i>: and after them <i>she</i> numbered all the <i>homies and palones</i>, even all the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, being <i>setter</i> <i>mille</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>trolled</i> out at noon. But Benhadad was <i>bevvying</i> himself <i>bevvied</i> in the pavilions, <i>she</i> and the <i>dowriest homies</i>, the <i>trey dacha</i> and <i>dewey</i> <i>dowriest homies</i> that helped <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>bean coves</i> of the <i>princesses</i> of the provinces <i>trolled</i> out first; and Benhadad <i>laued</i> out, and they <i>cackled</i> <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, There are <i>homies</i> <i>troll</i> out of Samaria.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Whether they be <i>troll</i> out for peace, <i>lell</i> them alive; or whether they be <i>troll</i> out for <i>barney</i>, <i>lell</i> them alive.
    </li>
    <li>So these <i>bean coves</i> of the <i>princesses</i> of the provinces <i>trolled</i> out of the <i>smoke</i>, and the army which <i>trolled after</i> them.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>ferricadoozaed</i> every <i>una</i> <i>her</i> <i>homie</i>: and the Syrians fled; and Israel pursued them: and Benhadad the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Syria <i>scarpered</i> on an horse with the horsemen.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel <i>trolled</i> out, and <i>slapped</i> the horses and <i>rattling coves</i>, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> the Syrians with a <i>dowry</i> slaughter.
    </li>
    <li>And the prophet <i>trolled</i> to the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>troll</i>, strengthen thyself, and <i>Marcia</i>, and <i>varda</i> what thou doest: for at the return of the year the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Syria will <i>troll</i> up against thee.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>serving homies</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Syria <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Their gods are gods of the hills; therefore they were <i>butcher</i> than we; but let us <i>palaver</i> against them in the plain, and surely we shall be <i>butcher</i> than they.
    </li>
    <li>And do this <i>fakement</i>, <i>lell</i> the <i>dowriest homies</i> away, every <i>homie</i> out of <i>her</i> place, and put captains in their <i>letties</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and <i>trundling cheat</i> for <i>trundling cheat</i>: and we will <i>palaver</i> against them in the plain, and surely we shall be <i>butcher</i> than they. And <i>she</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> unto their <i>cackling fakement</i>, and did so.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> at the return of the year, that Benhadad numbered the Syrians, and <i>trolled</i> up to Aphek, to <i>palaver</i> against Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and <i>trolled</i> against them: and the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel pitched before them like <i>dewey</i> <i>bijou</i> flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.
    </li>
    <li>And there <i>trolled</i> a <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel, and <i>cackled</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, Because the Syrians have <i>cackled</i>, The <i>Duchess</i> is <i>Gloria</i> of the hills, but <i>she</i> is not <i>Gloria</i> of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this <i>dowry</i> multitude into thine <i>famble</i>, and ye shall know that I am the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they pitched <i>una</i> over against the other <i>setter</i> days. And so it was, that in the <i>setterth</i> <i>journo</i> the battle was joined: and the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>ferricadoozaed</i> of the Syrians an <i>chenter</i> <i>mille</i> footmen in <i>una</i> <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>lettie</i> fled to Aphek, into the <i>smoke</i>; and there a wall fell upon <i>dewey dacha</i> and <i>setter</i> <i>mille</i> of the <i>homies</i> that were <i>dry</i>. And Benhadad fled, and <i>trolled</i> into the <i>smoke</i>, into an <i>back slum</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>varda</i> now, we have <i>aunt nelled</i> that the <i>dowriest homies</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of Israel are merciful <i>dowriest homies</i>: let us, I pray thee, put <i>nylon</i> on our loins, and ropes upon our <i>ekes</i>, and <i>troll out</i> to the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel: peradventure <i>she</i> will save thy life.
    </li>
    <li>So they girded <i>nylon</i> on their loins, and put ropes on their <i>ekes</i>, and <i>trolled</i> to the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel, and <i>cackled</i>, Thy <i>serving homie</i> Benhadad <i>cackleth</i>, I pray thee, let me live. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Is <i>she</i> yet alive? <i>she</i> is my <i>sister</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now the <i>homies</i> did diligently observe whether any <i>fakement</i> would <i>troll</i> from <i>her</i>, and did hastily catch it: and they <i>cackled</i>, Thy <i>sister</i> Benhadad. Then <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>troll</i> ye, <i>parker</i> <i>her</i>. Then Benhadad <i>trolled</i> forth to <i>her</i>; and <i>she</i> caused <i>her</i> to <i>troll</i> up into the <i>trundling cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Ben-hadad <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, The <i>smokes</i>, which my <i>Auntie</i> <i>lelled</i> from thy <i>Auntie</i>, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my <i>Auntie</i> made in Samaria. Then <i>cackled</i> Ahab, I will <i>lau</i> thee away with this covenant. So <i>she</i> made a covenant with <i>her</i>, and <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> away.
    </li>
    <li>And a certain <i>homie</i> of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of the prophets <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>homie ajax</i> in the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>slap</i> me, I pray thee. And the <i>homie</i> refused to <i>slap</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i> unto <i>her</i>, Because thou hast not obeyed the <i>cackling fakement</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>varda</i>, as soon as thou art <i>trolled off</i> from me, a lion shall <i>ferricadooza</i> thee. And as soon as <i>she</i> was <i>trolled off</i> from <i>her</i>, a lion found <i>her</i>, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>she</i> found another <i>homie</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>slap</i> me, I pray thee. And the <i>homie</i> <i>slapped</i> <i>her</i>, so that in smiting <i>she</i> wounded <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So the prophet <i>trolled off</i>, and waited for the <i>dowriest homie</i> by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And as the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>trolled by</i>, <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>: and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Thy <i>serving homie</i> <i>trolled</i> out into the midst of the battle; and, <i>varda</i>, a <i>homie</i> turned aside, and brought a <i>homie</i> unto me, and <i>cackled</i>, Keep this <i>homie</i>: if by any means <i>she</i> be missing, then shall thy life be for <i>her</i> life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.
    </li>
    <li>And as thy <i>serving homie</i> was busy here and there, <i>she</i> was <i>trolled</i>. And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided it.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> hasted, and <i>lelled</i> the ashes away from <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>; and the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel discerned <i>her</i> that <i>she</i> was of the prophets.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, Because thou hast let <i>troll out</i> of thy <i>famble</i> a <i>homie</i> whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore thy life shall <i>troll</i> for <i>her</i> life, and thy <i>homies and palones</i> for <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel <i>trolled</i> to <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i> heavy and displeased, and <i>trolled</i> to Samaria.

    <h2>Chapter 21</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> after these <i>fakements</i>, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the <i>dowry lattie</i> of Ahab <i>dowriest homie</i> of Samaria.
    </li>
    <li>And Ahab <i>cackled</i> unto Naboth, <i>cackling</i>, <i>parker</i> me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my <i>lattie</i>: and I will <i>parker</i> thee for it a <i>benar</i> vineyard than it; or, if it seem <i>bona</i> to thee, I will <i>parker</i> thee the worth of it in <i>dinarly</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Naboth <i>cackled</i> to Ahab, The <i>Duchess</i> forbid it me, that I should <i>parker</i> the inheritance of my <i>aunties</i> unto thee.
    </li>
    <li>And Ahab <i>trolled</i> into <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i> heavy and displeased because of the <i>lav</i> which Naboth the Jezreelite had <i>cackled</i> to <i>her</i>: for <i>she</i> had <i>cackled</i>, I will not <i>parker</i> thee the inheritance of my <i>aunties</i>. And <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> down upon <i>her</i> bed, and turned away <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>, and would <i>jarry</i> no <i>pannan</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But Jezebel <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i> <i>trolled</i> to <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Why is thy <i>Fairy</i> so sad, that thou <i>jarriest</i> no <i>pannan</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto her, Because I <i>cackled</i> unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>parker</i> me thy vineyard for <i>dinarly</i>; or else, if it please thee, I will <i>parker</i> thee another vineyard for it: and <i>she</i> answered, I will not <i>parker</i> thee my vineyard.
    </li>
    <li>And Jezebel <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and <i>jarry</i> <i>pannan</i>, and let thine <i>thumping cheat</i> be merry: I will <i>parker</i> thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.
    </li>
    <li>So she <i>screeved</i> letters in Ahab&#8217;s name, and sealed them with <i>her</i> seal, and <i>laued</i> the letters unto the <i>fungi</i> and to the nobles that were in <i>her</i> <i>smoke</i>, dwelling with Naboth.
    </li>
    <li>And she <i>screeved</i> in the letters, <i>cackling</i>, Proclaim a <i>nishta manjarry</i>, and set Naboth on high among the <i>homies and palones</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And set <i>dewey</i> <i>homies</i>, <i>homie chavvies</i> of Belial, before <i>her</i>, to bear <i>varda-ing fakement</i> against <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Thou didst blaspheme <i>Gloria</i> and the <i>dowriest homie</i>. And then carry <i>her</i> out, and stone <i>her</i>, that <i>she</i> may <i>cark it</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>homies</i> of <i>her</i> <i>smoke</i>, even the <i>fungi</i> and the nobles who were the inhabitants in <i>her</i> <i>smoke</i>, did as Jezebel had <i>laued</i> unto them, and as it was <i>screeved</i> in the letters which she had <i>laued</i> unto them.
    </li>
    <li>They proclaimed a <i>nishta manjarry</i>, and set Naboth on high among the <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And there <i>trolled</i> in <i>dewey</i> <i>homies</i>, <i>chavvies</i> of Belial, and sat before <i>her</i>: and the <i>homies</i> of Belial witnessed against <i>her</i>, even against Naboth, in the presence of the <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Naboth did blaspheme <i>Gloria</i> and the <i>dowriest homie</i>. Then they <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> forth out of the <i>smoke</i>, and stoned <i>her</i> with stones, that <i>she</i> <i>carked it</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then they <i>laued</i> to Jezebel, <i>cackling</i>, Naboth is stoned, and is <i>stiff</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when Jezebel <i>aunt nelled</i> that Naboth was stoned, and was <i>stiff</i>, that Jezebel <i>cackled</i> to Ahab, Arise, <i>lell</i> <i>fakement</i> of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which <i>she</i> refused to <i>parker</i> thee for <i>dinarly</i>: for Naboth is not alive, but <i>stiff</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when Ahab <i>aunt nelled</i> that Naboth was <i>stiff</i>, that Ahab rose up to <i>troll</i> down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to <i>lell</i> <i>fakement</i> of it.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> to Elijah the Tishbite, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Arise, <i>troll</i> down to meet Ahab <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel, which is in Samaria: <i>varda</i>, <i>she</i> is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither <i>she</i> is <i>trolled</i> down to possess it.
    </li>
    <li>And thou shalt <i>cackle</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, Hast thou <i>ferricadozad</i>, and also <i>lelled</i> <i>fakement</i>? And thou shalt <i>cackle</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, In the place where <i>women who are not conventionally attractive</i> licked the blood of Naboth shall <i>women who are not conventionally attractive</i> lick thy blood, even thine.
    </li>
    <li>And Ahab <i>cackled</i> to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And <i>she</i> answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself to <i>acting dickey</i> <i>nana</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, I will <i>parker</i> <i>nana</i> upon thee, and will <i>lell</i> away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab <i>her</i> that pisseth against the wall, and <i>her</i> that is shut up and <i>dry</i> in Israel,
    </li>
    <li>And will make thine <i>lattie</i> like the <i>lattie</i> of Jeroboam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nebat, and like the <i>lattie</i> of Baasha the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to <i>wild</i>, and made Israel to <i>kertever</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And of Jezebel also <i>cackled</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>cackling</i>, The <i>women who are not conventionally attractive</i> shall <i>jarry</i> Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.
    </li>
    <li><i>Her</i> that <i>carketh it</i> of Ahab in the <i>smoke</i> the <i>women who are not conventionally attractive</i> shall <i>jarry</i>; and <i>her</i> that <i>carketh it</i> in the field shall the fowls of the air <i>jarry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to <i>acting dickey</i> <i>naffness</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, whom Jezebel <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i> stirred up.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> did <i>dowry</i> abominably in following idols, according to all <i>fakements</i> as did the Amorites, whom the <i>Duchess</i> cast out before the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when Ahab <i>aunt nelled</i> those <i>lavs</i>, that <i>she</i> rent <i>her</i> <i>zhoosh</i>, and put <i>nylon</i> upon <i>her</i> flesh, and fasted, and <i>lett</i> in <i>nylon</i>, and <i>trolled</i> softly.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> to Elijah the Tishbite, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Vardest</i> thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because <i>she</i> humbleth himself before me, I will not <i>parker</i> the <i>nana</i> in <i>her</i> days: but in <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>&#8216;s days will I <i>parker</i> the <i>nana</i> upon <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>.

    <li><i>Any road up</i> in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah <i>trolled</i> down to the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel.

    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and <i>lell</i> it not out of the <i>famble</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Syria?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou <i>troll</i> with me to battle to Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat <i>cackled</i> to the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel, I am as thou art, my <i>homies and palones</i> as thy <i>homies and palones</i>, my horses as thy horses.

    <li>And Jehoshaphat <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> to <i>journo</i>.

    <li>Then the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel gathered the prophets together, about <i>quarter</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>homies</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto them, Shall I <i>troll</i> against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear?

    <li>And Jehoshaphat <i>cackled</i>, Is there not here a prophet of the <i>Duchess</i> besides, that we might enquire of <i>her</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel <i>cackled</i> unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet <i>una</i> <i>homie</i>, Micaiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the <i>Duchess</i>: but I hate <i>her</i>; for <i>she</i> doth not prophesy <i>bona</i> concerning me, but <i>nana</i>. And Jehoshaphat <i>cackled</i>, Let not the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackle</i> so.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel <i>screeched</i> an officer, and <i>cackled</i>, Hasten hither Micaiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Imlah.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel and Jehoshaphat the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah sat each on <i>her</i> throne, having put on their <i>frocks</i>, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
    </li>
    <li>And Zedekiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Chenaanah made <i>her</i> <i>colins</i> of iron: and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have consumed them.

    <li>And all the prophets prophesied so, <i>cackling</i>, <i>troll</i> up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the <i>Duchess</i> shall deliver it into the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>famble</i>.

    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel <i>cackled</i> unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not <i>cackle</i> thee that <i>she</i> would prophesy no <i>bona</i> concerning me, but <i>nana</i>?

    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>aunt nell</i> thou therefore the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>: I <i>vardad</i> the <i>Duchess</i> sitting on <i>her</i> throne, and all the host of heaven standing by <i>her</i> on <i>her</i> <i>sweet martini</i> and on <i>her</i> <i>dry</i>.

    <li>And Micaiah <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, thou shalt <i>varda</i> in that <i>journo</i>, when thou shalt <i>troll</i> into an <i>back slum</i> to hide thyself.

    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel <i>cackled</i> unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy <i>frocks</i>. And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel disguised himself, and <i>trolled</i> into the battle.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Syria commanded <i>her</i> <i>trey dacha</i> and <i>dewey</i> captains that had rule over <i>her</i> <i>rattling coves</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>palaver</i> <i>nishta</i> with <i>pogey</i> <i>nishta</i> <i>dowry</i>, save only with the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when the captains of the <i>rattling coves</i> <i>vardad</i> Jehoshaphat, that they <i>cackled</i>, Surely it is the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel. And they turned aside to <i>palaver</i> against <i>her</i>: and Jehoshaphat <i>screeched</i> out.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when the captains of the <i>rattling coves</i> perceived that it was not the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And a certain <i>homie</i> drew a bow at a venture, and <i>slapped</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto the driver of <i>her</i> <i>trundling cheat</i>, Turn thine <i>famble</i>, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.
    </li>
    <li>And the battle increased that <i>journo</i>: and the <i>dowriest homie</i> was stayed up in <i>her</i> <i>trundling cheat</i> against the Syrians, and <i>carked it</i> at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the <i>trundling cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And there <i>trolled</i> a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, <i>cackling</i>, Every <i>homie</i> to <i>her</i> <i>smoke</i>, and every <i>homie</i> to <i>her</i> own country.
    </li>
    <li>So the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>carked it</i>, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the <i>dowriest homie</i> in Samaria.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>una</i> <i>dhobied</i> the <i>trundling cheat</i> in the pool of Samaria; and the <i>women who are not conventionally attractive</i> licked up <i>her</i> blood; and they <i>dhobied</i> <i>her</i> armour; according unto the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> which <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now the <i>lettie</i> of the acts of Ahab, and all that <i>she</i> did, and the ivory <i>lattie</i> which <i>she</i> made, and all the <i>smokes</i> that <i>she</i> built, are they not <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the chronicles of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Israel?
    </li>
    <li>So Ahab <i>lettied</i> with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>; and Ahaziah <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> reigned in <i>her</i> stead.
    </li>
    <li>And Jehoshaphat the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Asa began to reign over Judah in the <i>quarter</i> year of Ahab <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>Jehoshaphat was <i>trey dacha</i> and <i>chinker</i> years <i>badge</i> when <i>she</i> began to reign; and <i>she</i> reigned <i>dewey dacha</i> and <i>chinker</i> years in Jerusalem. And <i>her</i> mother&#8217;s name was Azubah the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Shilhi.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>minced</i> in all the ways of Asa <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>; <i>she</i> turned not aside from it, doing that which was <i>sweet</i> in the <i>ogles</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>: <i>any road up</i> the high places were not <i>lelled</i> away; for the <i>homies and palones</i> offered and burnt <i>smelly</i> yet in the high places.
    </li>
    <li>And Jehoshaphat made peace with the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>Now the <i>lettie</i> of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and <i>her</i> might that <i>she</i> shewed, and how <i>she</i> warred, are they not <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the chronicles of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Judah?
    </li>
    <li>And the remnant of the <i>homie palones</i>, which remained in the days of <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> Asa, <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> out of the land.
    </li>
    <li>There was then no <i>dowriest homie</i> in Edom: a deputy was <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Jehoshaphat made <i>latties on water</i> of Tharshish to <i>troll</i> to Ophir for <i>gelt</i>: but they <i>trolled</i> not; for the <i>latties on water</i> were broken at Eziongeber.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> Ahaziah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my <i>serving homies</i> <i>troll</i> with thy <i>serving homies</i> in the <i>latties on water</i>. But Jehoshaphat would not.
    </li>
    <li>And Jehoshaphat <i>lettied</i> with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>, and was buried with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i> in the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i> <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>: and Jehoram <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> reigned in <i>her</i> stead.
    </li>
    <li>Ahaziah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, and reigned <i>dewey</i> years over Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> did <i>nana</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>minced</i> in the way of <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, and in the way of <i>her</i> mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nebat, who made Israel to <i>kertever</i>:
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> served Baal, and worshipped <i>her</i>, and provoked to <i>wild</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, according to all that <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> had done.
    </li>
