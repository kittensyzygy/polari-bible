    <h1>Nahum</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>The burden of Nineveh. The <i>glossy</i> of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.
    </li>
    <li><i>Gloria</i> is jealous, and the <i>Duchess</i> revengeth; the <i>Duchess</i> revengeth, and is furious; the <i>Duchess</i> will <i>lell</i> <i>the rights</i> on <i>her</i> adversaries, and <i>she</i> reserveth wrath for <i>her</i> enemies.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> is slow to <i>wild</i>, and <i>dowry</i> in power, and will not at all acquit the <i>naff</i>: the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>her</i> way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of <i>her</i> <i>plates</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languisheth.
    </li>
    <li>The mountains quake at <i>her</i>, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned at <i>her</i> presence, <i>any road up</i>, the world, and all that <i>lett</i> therein.
    </li>
    <li>Who can stand before <i>her</i> indignation? and who can <i>lett</i> in the fierceness of <i>her</i> <i>wild</i>? <i>her</i> fury is poured out like <i>binco fakement</i>, and the rocks are thrown down by <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> is <i>bona</i>, a <i>butch</i> hold in the <i>journo</i> of trouble; and <i>she</i> knoweth them that trust in <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But with an overrunning <i>dowry aqua</i> <i>she</i> will make an utter end of the place thereof, and <i>munge</i> shall pursue <i>her</i> enemies.
    </li>
    <li>What do ye imagine against the <i>Duchess</i>? <i>she</i> will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.
    </li>
    <li>For while they be folden together as thorns, and while they are <i>daffy</i> as drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry.
    </li>
    <li>There is <i>una</i> <i>troll</i> out of thee, that imagineth <i>nana</i> against the <i>Duchess</i>, a <i>naff</i> counsellor.
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>; Though they be quiet, and likewise many, yet thus shall they be cut down, when <i>she</i> shall pass through. Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee <i>nishta</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For now will I break <i>her</i> yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>parkered</i> a <i>butch lav</i> concerning thee, that <i>nishta</i> of thy name be sown: out of the <i>lattie</i> of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image: I will make thy grave; for thou art vile.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i> upon the mountains the <i>plates</i> of <i>her</i> that <i>parkereth</i> <i>bona</i> tidings, that publisheth peace! O Judah, keep thy solemn <i>dowry munjarlees</i>, perform thy vows: for the <i>naff</i> shall <i>nishta</i> pass through thee; <i>she</i> is utterly cut off.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>She</i> that dasheth in pieces is <i>troll</i> up before thy <i>eke</i>: keep the munition, <i>varda</i> the way, make thy loins <i>butch</i>, fortify thy power mightily.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>Duchess</i> hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and marred their vine branches.
    </li>
    <li>The shield of <i>her</i> <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i> is made red, the valiant <i>homies</i> are in scarlet: the <i>rattling coves</i> shall be with flaming torches in the <i>journo</i> of <i>her</i> preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>rattling coves</i> shall rage in the streets, they shall justle <i>una</i> against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> shall recount <i>her</i> worthies: they shall stumble in their <i>mince</i>; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be prepared.
    </li>
    <li>The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the <i>dowry lattie</i> shall be dissolved.
    </li>
    <li>And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up, and her maids shall lead her as with the <i>cackling fakement</i> of doves, tabering upon their <i>foofs</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But Nineveh is of <i>badge</i> like a pool of <i>aqua</i>: yet they shall <i>scarper</i> away. Stand, stand, shall they <i>screech</i>; but none shall <i>varda</i> back.
    </li>
    <li><i>Lell</i> ye the spoil of silver, <i>lell</i> the spoil of <i>gelt</i>: for there is none end of the store and <i>fabeness</i> out of all the <i>dolly</i> furniture.
    </li>
    <li>She is empty, and void, and waste: and the <i>thumping cheat</i> melteth, and the knees <i>slap</i> together, and <i>dowry</i> pain is in all loins, and the <i>ekes</i> of them all gather blackness.
    </li>
    <li>Where is the dwelling of the lions, and the feedingplace of the <i>bean</i> lions, where the lion, even the <i>badge</i> lion, <i>minced</i>, and the lion&#8217;s whelp, and none made them afraid?
    </li>
    <li>The lion did tear in pieces enough for <i>her</i> whelps, and strangled for <i>her</i> lionesses, and filled <i>her</i> holes with prey, and <i>her</i> dens with ravin.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, I am against thee, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts, and I will burn her <i>rattling coves</i> in the smoke, and the <i>dowry efink</i> shall devour thy <i>bean</i> lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the <i>cackling fakement</i> of thy messengers shall <i>nishta</i> be <i>aunt nelled</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Woe to the bloody <i>smoke</i>! it is all full of lies and robbery; the prey departeth not;
    </li>
    <li>The <i>screech</i> of a whip, and the <i>screech</i> of the rattling of the wheels, and of the pransing horses, and of the jumping <i>rattling coves</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The horseman lifteth up both the bright <i>dowry efink</i> and the glittering spear: and there is a multitude of <i>ferricadoozed</i>, and a <i>dowry</i> number of carcases; and there is none end of their corpses; they stumble upon their corpses:
    </li>
    <li>Because of the multitude of the <i>bitainedoms</i> of the wellfavoured <i>charvering donna</i>, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her <i>bitainedoms</i>, and families through her witchcrafts.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, I am against thee, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts; and I will discover thy <i>frocks</i> upon thy <i>eke</i>, and I will shew the nations thy <i>nanti zhoosh</i>, and the kingdoms thy <i>scharda</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and will set thee as a gazingstock.
    </li>
    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, that all they that <i>varda</i> upon thee shall <i>scarper</i> from thee, and <i>cackle</i>, Nineveh is <i>laued</i> waste: who will bemoan her? whence shall I <i>charper</i> comforters for thee?
    </li>
    <li>Art thou <i>benar</i> than populous No, that was situate among the rivers, that had the <i>aquas</i> round about it, whose rampart was the sea, and her wall was from the sea?
    </li>
    <li>Ethiopia and Egypt were her <i>butchness</i>, and it was infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers.
    </li>
    <li>Yet was she <i>lelled</i> away, she <i>trolled</i> into captivity: her <i>bean</i> <i>chavvies</i> also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they cast lots for her honourable <i>homies</i>, and all her <i>dowry</i> <i>homies</i> were bound in chains.
    </li>
    <li>Thou also shalt be <i>daffy</i>: thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt <i>charper</i> <i>butchness</i> because of the enemy.
    </li>
    <li>All thy <i>butch</i> holds shall be like fig trees with the firstripe figs: if they be shaken, they shall even fall into the <i>screech</i> of the eater.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, thy <i>homies and palones</i> in the midst of thee are <i>palones</i>: the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies: the <i>binco fakement</i> shall devour thy bars.
    </li>
    <li>Draw thee <i>aquas</i> for the siege, fortify thy <i>butch</i> holds: <i>troll</i> into clay, and <i>mince</i> the morter, make <i>butch</i> the brickkiln.
    </li>
    <li>There shall the <i>binco fakement</i> devour thee; the <i>dowry efink</i> shall cut thee off, it shall <i>jarry</i> thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts.
    </li>
    <li>Thou hast multiplied thy <i>bodega homies</i> above the <i>twinkling fakements</i> of heaven: the cankerworm spoileth, and fleeth away.
    </li>
    <li>Thy crowned are as the locusts, and thy captains as the <i>dowry</i> grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold <i>journo</i>, but when the sun ariseth they <i>scarper</i> away, and their place is not known where they are.
    </li>
    <li>Thy shepherds slumber, O <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria: thy nobles shall <i>lett</i> in the dust: thy <i>homies and palones</i> is scattered upon the mountains, and no <i>homie</i> gathereth them.
    </li>
    <li>There is no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is <i>naff</i>: all that <i>aunt nell</i> the bruit of thee shall clap the <i>fambles</i> over thee: for upon whom hath not thy <i>naffness</i> passed continually?
    </li>
