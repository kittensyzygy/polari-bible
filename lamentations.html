    <h1>Lamentations</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>How doth the <i>smoke</i> <i>lett</i> solitary, that was full of <i>homies and palones</i>! how is she become as a widow! she that was <i>dowry</i> among the nations, and princess among the provinces, how is she become tributary!
  </li>
  <li>She weepeth sore in the <i>nochy</i>, and her tears are on her cheeks: among all her <i>affairs</i> she hath none to comfort her: all her <i>bencoves</i> have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.
  </li>
  <li>Judah is <i>trolled</i> into captivity because of affliction, and because of <i>dowry</i> servitude: she <i>letteth</i> among the heathen, she findeth no <i>lettie</i>: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.
  </li>
  <li>The ways of Zion do mourn, because none <i>troll</i> to the solemn <i>dowry munjarlees</i>: all her gates are desolate: her <i>godly homies</i> sigh, her <i>nanti charvers</i> are afflicted, and she is in bitterness.
  </li>
  <li>Her adversaries are the <i>dowriest</i>, her enemies prosper; for the <i>Duchess</i> hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her <i>chavvies</i> are <i>trolled</i> into captivity before the enemy.
  </li>
  <li>And from the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Zion all her beauty is <i>trolled off</i>: her <i>princesses</i> are become like harts that find no pasture, and they are <i>trolled</i> <i>nanti</i> <i>butchness</i> before the pursuer.
  </li>
  <li>Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her <i>dolly</i> <i>fakements</i> that she had in the days of <i>badge</i>, when her <i>homies and palones</i> fell into the <i>famble</i> of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries <i>vardad</i> her, and did mock at her sabbaths.
  </li>
  <li>Jerusalem hath grievously <i>kertervered</i>; therefore she is removed: all that honoured her despise her, because they have <i>vardad</i> her <i>nanti zhoosh</i>: <i>any road up</i>, she sigheth, and turneth backward.
  </li>
  <li>Her filthiness is in her <i>frocks</i>; she remembereth not her last end; therefore she <i>trolled</i> down wonderfully: she had no comforter. O <i>Duchess</i>, <i>varda</i> my affliction: for the enemy hath magnified himself.
  </li>
  <li>The adversary hath spread out <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> upon all her <i>dolly</i> <i>fakements</i>: for she hath <i>vardad</i> that the heathen entered into her sanctuary, whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy <i>punters</i>.
  </li>
  <li>All her <i>homies and palones</i> sigh, they <i>charper</i> <i>pannan</i>; they have <i>parkered</i> their <i>dolly</i> <i>fakements</i> for <i>carnish</i> to relieve the <i>nishta lucoddy</i>: <i>varda</i>, O <i>Duchess</i>, and consider; for I am become vile.
  </li>
  <li>Is it <i>nishter</i> to you, all ye that <i>troll by</i>? <i>varda</i>, and <i>varda</i> if there be any <i>sharda</i> like unto my <i>sharda</i>, which is done unto me, wherewith the <i>Duchess</i> hath afflicted me in the <i>journo</i> of <i>her</i> fierce <i>wild</i>.
  </li>
  <li>From above hath <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> <i>binco fakement</i> into my bones, and it prevaileth against them: <i>she</i> hath spread a net for my <i>plates</i>, <i>she</i> hath turned me back: <i>she</i> hath made me desolate and faint all the <i>journo</i>.
  </li>
  <li>The yoke of my transgressions is bound by <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>: they are wreathed, and <i>troll</i> up upon my neck: <i>she</i> hath made my <i>butchness</i> to fall, the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>laued</i> me into their <i>fambles</i>, from whom I am not able to rise up.
  </li>
  <li>The <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>minced</i> under <i>plate</i> all my <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i> in the midst of me: <i>she</i> hath <i>screeched</i> an assembly against me to crush my <i>bean coves</i>: the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>minced</i> the <i>nanti charver</i>, the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Judah, as in a winepress.
  </li>
  <li>For these <i>fakements</i> I <i>parnie</i>; mine <i>ogle</i>, mine <i>ogle</i> runneth down with <i>aqua</i>, because the comforter that should relieve my <i>nishta lucoddy</i> is <i>nishter ajax</i> me: my <i>chavvies</i> are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.
  </li>
  <li>Zion spreadeth forth her <i>fambles</i>, and there is none to comfort her: the <i>Duchess</i> hath commanded concerning Jacob, that <i>her</i> adversaries should be round about <i>her</i>: Jerusalem is as a menstruous <i>palone</i> among them.
  </li>
  <li>The <i>Duchess</i> is <i>bona</i>; for I have rebelled against <i>her</i> <i>butch lav</i>: <i>aunt nell</i>, I pray you, all <i>homies and palones</i>, and <i>varda</i> my <i>sharda</i>: my <i>nanti charvers</i> and my <i>bean coves</i> are <i>trolled</i> into captivity.
  </li>
  <li>I <i>screeched</i> for my <i>affairs</i>, but they <i>mogued</i> me: my <i>godly homies</i> and mine <i>fungi</i> <i>parkered</i> up the <i>fairy</i> in the <i>smoke</i>, while they sought their <i>carnish</i> to relieve their <i>nishta lucoddies</i>.
  </li>
  <li><i>Varda</i>, O <i>Duchess</i>; for I am in distress: my <i>chutney locker</i> are troubled; mine <i>thumping cheat</i> is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: abroad the <i>dowry efink</i> bereaveth, at home there is as <i>carking it</i>.
  </li>
  <li>They have <i>aunt nelled</i> that I sigh: there is none to comfort me: all mine enemies have <i>aunt nelled</i> of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done it: thou wilt <i>parker</i> the <i>journo</i> that thou hast <i>screeched</i>, and they shall be like unto me.
  </li>
  <li>Let all their <i>naffness</i> <i>troll</i> before thee; and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs are many, and my <i>thumping cheat</i> is faint.
  </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>How hath the <i>Duchess</i> covered the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Zion with a cloud in <i>her</i> <i>wild</i>, and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered not <i>her</i> footstool in the <i>journo</i> of <i>her</i> <i>wild</i>!
  </li>
  <li>The <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>jarried</i> up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied: <i>she</i> hath thrown down in <i>her</i> wrath the <i>butch</i> holds of the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Judah; <i>she</i> hath brought them down to the ground: <i>she</i> hath <i>dingy</i> the kingdom and the <i>princesses</i> thereof.
  </li>
  <li><i>She</i> hath cut off in <i>her</i> fierce <i>wild</i> all the <i>colin</i> of Israel: <i>she</i> hath drawn back <i>her</i> <i>sweet martini</i> from before the enemy, and <i>she</i> burned against Jacob like a flaming <i>binco fakement</i>, which devoureth round about.
  </li>
  <li><i>She</i> hath bent <i>her</i> bow like an enemy: <i>she</i> stood with <i>her</i> <i>sweet martini</i> as an adversary, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> all that were <i>dolly</i> to the <i>ogle</i> in the <i>bijou tabernaclette</i> of the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Zion: <i>she</i> poured out <i>her</i> fury like <i>binco fakement</i>.
  </li>
  <li>The <i>Duchess</i> was as an enemy: <i>she</i> hath <i>jarried</i> up Israel, <i>she</i> hath <i>jarried</i> up all her <i>dowry latties</i>: <i>she</i> hath <i>battyfanged</i> <i>her</i> <i>butch</i> holds, and hath increased in the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Judah mourning and lamentation.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>she</i> hath violently <i>lelled</i> away <i>her</i> <i>bijou tabernaclette</i>, as if it were of a garden: <i>she</i> hath <i>battyfanged</i> <i>her</i> places of the assembly: the <i>Duchess</i> hath caused the solemn <i>dowry munjarlees</i> and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of <i>her</i> <i>wild</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> and the <i>godly homie</i>.
  </li>
  <li>The <i>Duchess</i> hath cast off <i>her</i> <i>grovelling fakement</i>, <i>she</i> hath abhorred <i>her</i> sanctuary, <i>she</i> hath <i>parkered</i> up into the <i>famble</i> of the enemy the walls of her <i>dowry latties</i>; they have made a <i>screech</i> in the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, as in the <i>journo</i> of a solemn <i>dowry munjarlee</i>.
  </li>
  <li>The <i>Duchess</i> hath purposed to <i>battyfang</i> the wall of the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Zion: <i>she</i> hath stretched out a line, <i>she</i> hath not withdrawn <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> from destroying: therefore <i>she</i> made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together.
  </li>
  <li>Her gates are sunk into the ground; <i>she</i> hath <i>battyfanged</i> and broken her bars: her <i>dowriest homie</i> and her <i>princesses</i> are among the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>: the law is <i>nishta</i>; her prophets also find no vision from the <i>Duchess</i>.
  </li>
  <li>The <i>fungi</i> of the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Zion <i>lett</i> upon the ground, and keep <i>nishta cackle</i>: they have cast up dust upon their <i>ekes</i>; they have girded themselves with <i>nylon</i>: the <i>nanti charvers</i> of Jerusalem hang down their <i>ekes</i> to the ground.
  </li>
  <li>Mine <i>ogles</i> do fail with tears, my <i>chutney locker</i> are troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the <i>palone chavvie</i> of my <i>homies and palones</i>; because the <i>chavvies</i> and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the <i>smoke</i>.
  </li>
  <li>They <i>cackle</i> to their mothers, Where is corn and <i>sherry</i>? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the <i>smoke</i>, when their <i>nishta lucoddy</i> was poured out into their mothers&#8217; bosom.
  </li>
  <li>What <i>fakement</i> shall I <i>lell</i> to <i>varda-ing fakement</i> for thee? what <i>fakement</i> shall I liken to thee, O <i>palone chavvie</i> of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O <i>nanti charver</i> <i>palone chavvie</i> of Zion? for thy breach is <i>dowry</i> like the sea: who can heal thee?
  </li>
  <li>Thy prophets have <i>vardad</i> vain and <i>dizzy</i> <i>fakements</i> for thee: and they have not discovered thine <i>codness</i>, to turn away thy captivity; but have <i>vardad</i> for thee false burdens and causes of banishment.
  </li>
  <li>All that <i>troll by</i> clap their <i>fambles</i> at thee; they hiss and wag their <i>eke</i> at the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Jerusalem, <i>cackling</i>, Is this the <i>smoke</i> that <i>homies</i> <i>screech</i> The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?
  </li>
  <li>All thine enemies have opened their <i>screech</i> against thee: they hiss and gnash the <i>hampsteads</i>: they <i>cackle</i>, We have <i>jarried</i> her up: <i>mais oui</i> this is the <i>journo</i> that we looked for; we have found, we have <i>vardad</i> it.
  </li>
  <li>The <i>Duchess</i> hath done that which <i>she</i> had devised; <i>she</i> hath fulfilled <i>her</i> <i>lav</i> that <i>she</i> had commanded in the days of <i>badge</i>: <i>she</i> hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and <i>she</i> hath caused thine enemy to rejoice over thee, <i>she</i> hath set up the <i>colin</i> of thine adversaries.
  </li>
  <li>Their <i>thumping cheat</i> <i>screeched</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>, O wall of the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Zion, let tears run down like a river <i>journo</i> and <i>nochy</i>: <i>parker</i> thyself no <i>lettie</i>; let not the apple of thine <i>ogle</i> cease.
  </li>
  <li>Arise, <i>screech</i> out in the <i>nochy</i>: in the beginning of the watches pour out thine <i>thumping cheat</i> like <i>aqua</i> before the <i>eke</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>: lift up thy <i>fambles</i> toward <i>her</i> for the life of thy <i>bean</i> <i>chavvies</i>, that faint for hunger in the top of every street.
  </li>
  <li><i>Varda</i>, O <i>Duchess</i>, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall the <i>palones</i> <i>jarry</i> their fruit, and <i>chavvies</i> of a span long? shall the <i>godly homie</i> and the prophet be <i>ferricadoozed</i> in the sanctuary of the <i>Duchess</i>?
  </li>
  <li>The <i>bean</i> and the <i>badge</i> lie on the ground in the streets: my <i>nanti charvers</i> and my <i>bean coves</i> are fallen by the <i>dowry efink</i>; thou hast <i>ferricadoozed</i> them in the <i>journo</i> of thine <i>wild</i>; thou hast <i>ferricadozad</i>, and not pitied.
  </li>
  <li>Thou hast <i>screeched</i> as in a solemn <i>journo</i> my terrors round about, so that in the <i>journo</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s <i>wild</i> none <i>scarpered</i> <i>nishta</i> remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.
  </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>I AM the <i>homie</i> that hath <i>vardad</i> affliction by the rod of <i>her</i> wrath.
  </li>
  <li><i>She</i> hath led me, and brought me into <i>munge</i>, but not into <i>sparkle</i>.
  </li>
  <li>Surely against me is <i>she</i> turned; <i>she</i> turneth <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> against me all the <i>journo</i>.
  </li>
  <li>My flesh and my skin hath <i>she</i> made <i>badge</i>; <i>she</i> hath broken my bones.
  </li>
  <li><i>She</i> hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail.
  </li>
  <li><i>She</i> hath set me in dark places, as they that be <i>stiff</i> of <i>badge</i>.
  </li>
  <li><i>She</i> hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: <i>she</i> hath made my chain heavy.
  </li>
  <li>Also when I <i>screech</i> and <i>screech</i>, <i>she</i> shutteth out my <i>meshigener muttering</i>.
  </li>
  <li><i>She</i> hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, <i>she</i> hath made my paths <i>bent</i>.
  </li>
  <li><i>She</i> was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret places.
  </li>
  <li><i>She</i> hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: <i>she</i> hath made me desolate.
  </li>
  <li><i>She</i> hath bent <i>her</i> bow, and set me as a <i>Marcia</i> for the arrow.
  </li>
  <li><i>She</i> hath caused the arrows of <i>her</i> quiver to enter into my reins.
  </li>
  <li>I was a derision to all my <i>homies and palones</i>; and their <i>chant</i> all the <i>journo</i>.
  </li>
  <li><i>She</i> hath filled me with bitterness, <i>she</i> hath made me <i>daffy</i> with wormwood.
  </li>
  <li><i>She</i> hath also broken my <i>hampsteads</i> with gravel stones, <i>she</i> hath covered me with ashes.
  </li>
  <li>And thou hast removed my <i>nishta lucoddy</i> far off from peace: I forgat prosperity.
  </li>
  <li>And I <i>cackled</i>, My <i>butchness</i> and my hope is perished from the <i>Duchess</i>:
  </li>
  <li>Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.
  </li>
  <li>My <i>nishta lucoddy</i> hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.
  </li>
  <li>This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.
  </li>
  <li>It is of the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s mercies that we are not consumed, because <i>her</i> compassions fail not.
  </li>
  <li>They are new every morning: <i>dowry</i> is thy faithfulness.
  </li>
  <li>The <i>Duchess</i> is my portion, <i>cackleth</i> my <i>nishta lucoddy</i>; therefore will I hope in <i>her</i>.
  </li>
  <li>The <i>Duchess</i> is <i>bona</i> unto them that wait for <i>her</i>, to the <i>nishta lucoddy</i> that <i>charpereth</i> <i>her</i>.
  </li>
  <li>It is <i>bona</i> that a <i>homie</i> should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the <i>Duchess</i>.
  </li>
  <li>It is <i>bona</i> for a <i>homie</i> that <i>she</i> bear the yoke of <i>her</i> <i>beandom</i>.
  </li>
  <li><i>She</i> sitteth alone and keepeth <i>nishta cackle</i>, because <i>she</i> hath borne it upon <i>her</i>.
  </li>
  <li><i>She</i> <i>laueth</i> <i>her</i> <i>screech</i> in the dust; if so be there may be hope.
  </li>
  <li><i>She</i> giveth <i>her</i> cheek to <i>her</i> that <i>slappeth</i> <i>her</i>: <i>she</i> is filled full with reproach.
  </li>
  <li>For the <i>Duchess</i> will not cast off for ever:
  </li>
  <li>But though <i>she</i> cause grief, yet will <i>she</i> have compassion according to the multitude of <i>her</i> mercies.
  </li>
  <li>For <i>she</i> doth not afflict willingly <i>nishta</i> grieve the <i>chavvies</i> of <i>homies</i>.
  </li>
  <li>To crush under <i>her</i> <i>plates</i> all the prisoners of the earth.
  </li>
  <li>To turn aside the <i>sweet</i> of a <i>homie</i> before the <i>eke</i> of the most High,
  </li>
  <li>To subvert a <i>homie</i> in <i>her</i> cause, the <i>Duchess</i> approveth not.
  </li>
  <li>Who is <i>she</i> that <i>cackleth</i>, and it <i>trolleth</i> to pass, when the <i>Duchess</i> commandeth it not?
  </li>
  <li>Out of the <i>screech</i> of the most High proceedeth not <i>nana</i> and <i>bona</i>?
  </li>
  <li>Wherefore doth a living <i>homie</i> complain, a <i>homie</i> for the <i>zsa zsa-ing</i> of <i>her</i> <i>kertervers</i>?
  </li>
  <li>Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the <i>Duchess</i>.
  </li>
  <li>Let us lift up our <i>thumping cheat</i> with our <i>fambles</i> unto <i>Gloria</i> in the heavens.
  </li>
  <li>We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned.
  </li>
  <li>Thou hast covered with <i>wild</i>, and <i>chivvied</i> us: thou hast <i>ferricadoozed</i>, thou hast not pitied.
  </li>
  <li>Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our <i>meshigener muttering</i> should not pass through.
  </li>
  <li>Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the <i>homies and palones</i>.
  </li>
  <li>All our enemies have opened their <i>screeches</i> against us.
  </li>
  <li>Fear and a snare is <i>troll</i> upon us, desolation and destruction.
  </li>
  <li>Mine <i>ogle</i> runneth down with rivers of <i>aqua</i> for the destruction of the <i>palone chavvie</i> of my <i>homies and palones</i>.
  </li>
  <li>Mine <i>ogle</i> trickleth down, and ceaseth not, <i>nanti</i> any intermission.
  </li>
  <li>Till the <i>Duchess</i> <i>varda</i> down, and <i>varda</i> from heaven.
  </li>
  <li>Mine <i>ogle</i> affecteth mine <i>thumping cheat</i> because of all the <i>palone chavvies</i> of my <i>smoke</i>.
  </li>
  <li>Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, <i>nanti</i> cause.
  </li>
  <li>They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me.
  </li>
  <li><i>Aquas</i> flowed over mine <i>eke</i>; then I <i>cackled</i>, I am cut off.
  </li>
  <li>I <i>screeched</i> upon thy name, O <i>Duchess</i>, out of the low dungeon.
  </li>
  <li>Thou hast <i>aunt nelled</i> my <i>cackling fakement</i>: hide not thine <i>aunt nelling cheat</i> at my breathing, at my <i>screech</i>.
  </li>
  <li>Thou drewest near in the <i>journo</i> that I <i>screeched</i> upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not.
  </li>
  <li>O <i>Duchess</i>, thou hast pleaded the causes of my <i>nishta lucoddy</i>; thou hast redeemed my life.
  </li>
  <li>O <i>Duchess</i>, thou hast <i>vardad</i> my wrong: <i>beak</i> thou my cause.
  </li>
  <li>Thou hast <i>vardad</i> all their <i>the rights</i> and all their imaginations against me.
  </li>
  <li>Thou hast <i>aunt nelled</i> their reproach, O <i>Duchess</i>, and all their imaginations against me;
  </li>
  <li>The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the <i>journo</i>.
  </li>
  <li><i>Varda</i> their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their musick.
  </li>
  <li>Render unto them a recompence, O <i>Duchess</i>, according to the <i>acting dickey</i> of their <i>fambles</i>.
  </li>
  <li><i>Parker</i> them <i>sharda</i> of <i>thumping cheat</i>, thy curse unto them.
  </li>
  <li><i>Chivvy</i> and <i>battyfang</i> them in <i>wild</i> from under the heavens of the <i>Duchess</i>.
  </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>How is the <i>gelt</i> become dim! how is the most <i>bona</i> <i>gelt</i> changed! the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street.
  </li>
  <li>The precious <i>homie chavvies</i> of Zion, comparable to <i>bona</i> <i>gelt</i>, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the <i>acting dickey</i> of the <i>fambles</i> of the potter!
  </li>
  <li>Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they <i>parker</i> suck to their <i>bean</i> ones: the <i>palone chavvie</i> of my <i>homies and palones</i> is become cruel, like the ostriches in the <i>nishta smoke</i>.
  </li>
  <li>The <i>polari</i> of the sucking <i>chavvie</i> cleaveth to the roof of <i>her</i> <i>screech</i> for thirst: the <i>bean</i> <i>chavvies</i> ask <i>pannan</i>, and no <i>homie</i> breaketh it unto them.
  </li>
  <li>They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.
  </li>
  <li>For the <i>zsa zsa-ing</i> of the <i>codness</i> of the <i>palone chavvie</i> of my <i>homies and palones</i> is <i>dowrier</i> than the <i>zsa zsa-ing</i> of the <i>kertever</i> of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no <i>fambles</i> stayed on her.
  </li>
  <li>Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in <i>lucoddy</i> than rubies, their polishing was of sapphire:
  </li>
  <li>Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick.
  </li>
  <li>They that be <i>ferricadoozed</i> with the <i>dowry efink</i> are <i>benar</i> than they that be <i>ferricadoozed</i> with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for want of the fruits of the field.
  </li>
  <li>The <i>fambles</i> of the pitiful <i>palones</i> have sodden their own <i>chavvies</i>: they were their <i>carnish</i> in the destruction of the <i>palone chavvie</i> of my <i>homies and palones</i>.
  </li>
  <li>The <i>Duchess</i> hath accomplished <i>her</i> fury; <i>she</i> hath poured out <i>her</i> fierce <i>wild</i>, and hath kindled a <i>binco fakement</i> in Zion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof.
  </li>
  <li>The <i>dowriest homies</i> of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem.
  </li>
  <li>For the <i>kertervers</i> of her prophets, and the <i>cods</i> of her <i>godly homies</i>, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her,
  </li>
  <li>They have wandered as <i>nanti varda</i> <i>homies</i> in the streets, they have <i>dingy</i> themselves with blood, so that <i>homies</i> could not <i>reef</i> their <i>frocks</i>.
  </li>
  <li>They <i>screeched</i> unto them, <i>troll off</i> ye; it is <i>nanti sparkle</i>; <i>troll off</i>, <i>troll off</i>, <i>reef</i> not: when they fled away and wandered, they <i>cackled</i> among the heathen, They shall <i>nishta</i> sojourn there.
  </li>
  <li>The <i>wild</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>medzered</i> them; <i>she</i> will <i>nishta</i> regard them: they respected not the persons of the <i>godly homies</i>, they favoured not the <i>fungi</i>.
  </li>
  <li>As for us, our <i>ogles</i> as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us.
  </li>
  <li>They hunt our steps, that we cannot <i>troll</i> in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is <i>troll</i>.
  </li>
  <li>Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they pursued us upon the mountains, they <i>laued</i> wait for us in the <i>nishta smoke</i>.
  </li>
  <li>The breath of our <i>bugle</i>, the anointed of the <i>Duchess</i>, was <i>lelled</i> in their pits, of whom we <i>cackled</i>, Under <i>her</i> shadow we shall live among the heathen.
  </li>
  <li>Rejoice and be glad, O <i>palone chavvie</i> of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be <i>daffy</i>, and shalt make thyself <i>nanti zhoosh</i>.
  </li>
  <li>The <i>zsa zsa-ing</i> of thine <i>codness</i> is accomplished, O <i>palone chavvie</i> of Zion; <i>she</i> will <i>nishta</i> carry thee away into captivity: <i>she</i> will visit thine <i>codness</i>, O <i>palone chavvie</i> of Edom; <i>she</i> will discover thy <i>kertervers</i>.
  </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>Remember, O <i>Duchess</i>, what is <i>troll</i> upon us: consider, and <i>varda</i> our reproach.
  </li>
  <li>Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our <i>latties</i> to aliens.
  </li>
  <li>We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers are as widows.
  </li>
  <li>We have <i>daffy</i> our <i>aqua</i> for <i>dinarly</i>; our wood is sold unto us.
  </li>
  <li>Our necks are under <i>chivvying</i>: we <i>acting dickey</i>, and have no <i>lettie</i>.
  </li>
  <li>We have <i>parkered</i> the <i>famble</i> to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with <i>pannan</i>.
  </li>
  <li>Our <i>aunties</i> have <i>kertervered</i>, and are not; and we have borne their <i>cods</i>.
  </li>
  <li><i>Serving homies</i> have ruled over us: there is none that doth deliver us out of their <i>famble</i>.
  </li>
  <li>We gat our <i>pannan</i> with the peril of our lives because of the <i>dowry efink</i> of the <i>nishta smoke</i>.
  </li>
  <li>Our skin was <i>goolie</i> like an oven because of the <i>nanna</i> <i>nix munjarlee</i>.
  </li>
  <li>They ravished the <i>palones</i> in Zion, and the maids in the <i>smokes</i> of Judah.
  </li>
  <li><i>Princesses</i> are hanged up by their <i>famble</i>: the <i>ekes</i> of <i>fungi</i> were not honoured.
  </li>
  <li>They <i>lelled</i> the <i>bean coves</i> to grind, and the <i>chavvies</i> fell under the wood.
  </li>
  <li>The <i>fungi</i> have ceased from the gate, the <i>bean coves</i> from their musick.
  </li>
  <li>The joy of our <i>thumping cheat</i> is ceased; our <i>wallop</i> is turned into mourning.
  </li>
  <li>The <i>mudge</i> is fallen from our <i>eke</i>: woe unto us, that we have <i>kertervered</i>!
  </li>
  <li>For this our <i>thumping cheat</i> is faint; for these <i>fakements</i> our <i>ogles</i> are dim.
  </li>
  <li>Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes <i>mince</i> upon it.
  </li>
  <li>Thou, O <i>Duchess</i>, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation to generation.
  </li>
  <li>Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, and forsake us so long time?
  </li>
  <li>Turn thou us unto thee, O <i>Duchess</i>, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of <i>badge</i>.
  </li>
  <li>But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art <i>dowry</i> <i>dander</i> against us.
  </li>
