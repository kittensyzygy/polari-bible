    <h1>Mark</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>The beginning of the <i>gossip</i> of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>;
    </li>
    <li>As it is <i>screeved</i> in the prophets, <i>varda</i>, I <i>lau</i> my messenger before thy <i>eke</i>, which shall prepare thy way before thee.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>cackling fakement</i> of <i>una</i> <i>screeching</i> in the <i>nishta smoke</i>, Prepare ye the way of the <i>Duchess</i>, make <i>her</i> paths <i>hettie</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Jane</i> did baptize in the <i>nishta smoke</i>, and <i>cackle</i> the baptism of repentance for the remission of <i>kertervers</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And there <i>trolled</i> out unto <i>her</i> all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of <i>her</i> in the river of Jordan, confessing their <i>kertervers</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Jane</i> was clothed with camel&#8217;s <i>riah</i>, and with a girdle of a skin about <i>her</i> loins; and <i>she</i> did <i>jarry</i> locusts and wild honey;
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackled</i>, <i>cackling</i>, There <i>trolleth</i> <i>una</i> mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose <i>slingbacks</i> I am not <i>bona</i> to stoop down and unloose.
    </li>
    <li>I indeed have baptized you with <i>aqua</i>: but <i>she</i> shall baptize you with the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> in those days, that <i>Josie</i> <i>trolled</i> from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of <i>Jane</i> in Jordan.
    </li>
    <li>And straightway <i>trolling</i> up out of the <i>aqua</i>, <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> the heavens opened, and the <i>Fairy</i> like a dove <i>trolling down</i> upon <i>her</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And there <i>trolled</i> a <i>cackling fakement</i> from heaven, <i>cackling</i>, Thou art my beloved <i>homie chavvie</i>, in whom I am well pleased.
    </li>
    <li>And immediately the <i>Fairy</i> driveth <i>her</i> into the <i>nishta smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> was there in the <i>nishta smoke</i> <i>quarter dacha</i> days, tempted of <i>Sadie</i>; and was with the wild beasts; and the <i>fairies</i> ministered unto <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now after that <i>Jane</i> was put in <i>charpering carsey</i>, <i>Josie</i> <i>trolled</i> into Galilee, <i>cackling</i> the <i>gossip</i> of the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackling</i>, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i> is at <i>famble</i>: repent ye, and believe the <i>gossip</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now as <i>she</i> <i>minced</i> by the sea of Galilee, <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> <i>Simone</i> and <i>Andrea</i> <i>her</i> <i>sister</i> <i>chucking</i> a net into the sea: for they were fishers.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>troll</i> ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And straightway they forsook their nets, and <i>trolled after</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> had <i>trolled</i> a <i>bijou</i> farther thence, <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> James the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Zebedee, and <i>Jane</i> <i>her</i> <i>sister</i>, who also were in the <i>lattie on water</i> mending their nets.
    </li>
    <li>And straightway <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> them: and they <i>dry</i> their <i>Auntie</i> Zebedee in the <i>lattie on water</i> with the hired <i>serving homies</i>, and <i>trolled</i> after <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>trolled</i> into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath <i>journo</i> <i>she</i> entered into the synagogue, and taught.
    </li>
    <li>And they were <i>gobsmacked</i> at <i>her</i> doctrine: for <i>she</i> taught them as <i>una</i> that had authority, and not as the <i>betty bracelets</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And there was in their synagogue a <i>homie</i> with an <i>nanti sparkle</i> <i>Fairy</i>; and <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> out,
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackling</i>, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou <i>Josie</i> of Nazareth? art thou <i>troll</i> to <i>battyfang</i> us? I know thee who thou art, the <i>fabulosa</i> <i>una</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> rebuked <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Hold thy peace, and <i>troll</i> out of <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>nanti sparkle</i> <i>Fairy</i> had torn <i>her</i>, and <i>screeched</i> with a loud <i>cackling fakement</i>, <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> out of <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they were all <i>gobsmacked</i>, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, <i>cackling</i>, What <i>fakement</i> is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth <i>she</i> even the <i>nanti sparkle</i> <i>fairies</i>, and they do obey <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And immediately <i>her</i> fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.
    </li>
    <li>And forthwith, when they were <i>troll</i> out of the synagogue, they entered into the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Simone</i> and <i>Andrea</i>, with James and <i>Jane</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>Simone</i>&#8216;s <i>palone affair</i>&#8216;s mother <i>lett</i> sick of a fever, and anon they <i>cackle</i> <i>her</i> of her.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> and <i>lelled</i> her by the <i>famble</i>, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever <i>dry</i> her, and she ministered unto them.
    </li>
    <li>And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto <i>her</i> all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.
    </li>
    <li>And all the <i>smoke</i> was gathered together at the door.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to <i>cackle</i>, because they knew <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And in the morning, rising up a <i>dowry</i> while before <i>journo</i>, <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> out, and <i>trolled off</i> into a solitary place, and there prayed.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Simone</i> and they that were with <i>her</i> <i>trolled after</i> after <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when they had found <i>her</i>, they <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, All <i>homies</i> <i>charper</i> for thee.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Let us <i>troll</i> into the next towns, that I may <i>cackle</i> there also: for therefore <i>trolled</i> I forth.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.
    </li>
    <li>And there <i>trolled</i> a leper to <i>her</i>, beseeching <i>her</i>, and kneeling down to <i>her</i>, and <i>cackling</i> unto <i>her</i>, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i>, <i>trolled</i> with compassion, put forth <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>, and <i>reefed</i> <i>her</i>, and <i>cackleth</i> unto <i>her</i>, I will; be thou clean.
    </li>
    <li>And as soon as <i>she</i> had <i>cackled</i>, immediately the leprosy <i>trolled off</i> from <i>her</i>, and <i>she</i> was cleansed.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>hettily</i> charged <i>her</i>, and forthwith <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> away;
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackleth</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>varda</i> thou <i>cackle</i> <i>nishter</i> to any <i>homie</i>: but <i>troll</i> thy way, shew thyself to the <i>godly homie</i>, and offer for thy cleansing those <i>fakements</i> which <i>Maureen</i> commanded, for a testimony unto them.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> out, and began to publish it <i>dowry</i>, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that <i>Josie</i> could <i>nishta</i> openly enter into the <i>smoke</i>, but was <i>nanti</i> in desert places: and they <i>trolled</i> to <i>her</i> from every quarter.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And again <i>she</i> entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was noised that <i>she</i> was in the <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to <i>lall</i> them, no, not so <i>dowry</i> as about the door: and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> the <i>lav</i> unto them.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>troll</i> unto <i>her</i>, bringing <i>una</i> sick of the palsy, which was borne of <i>quarter</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when they could not <i>troll</i> <i>ajax</i> unto <i>her</i> for the press, they uncovered the roof where <i>she</i> was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy <i>lett</i>.
    </li>
    <li>When <i>Josie</i> <i>vardad</i> their faith, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto the sick of the palsy, <i>homie chavvie</i>, thy <i>kertervers</i> be forgiven thee.
    </li>
    <li>But there was certain of the <i>betty bracelets</i> sitting there, and reasoning in their <i>thumping cheats</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Why doth this <i>homie</i> thus <i>cackle</i> <i>billingsgates</i>? who can forgive <i>kertervers</i> but <i>Gloria</i> only?
    </li>
    <li>And immediately when <i>Josie</i> perceived in <i>her</i> <i>Fairy</i> that they so reasoned within themselves, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Why reason ye these <i>fakements</i> in your <i>thumping cheats</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Whether is it easier to <i>cackle</i> to the sick of the palsy, Thy <i>kertervers</i> be forgiven thee; or to <i>cackle</i>, Arise, and <i>lell</i> up thy bed, and <i>mince</i>?
    </li>
    <li>But that ye may know that the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> hath power on earth to forgive <i>kertervers</i>, (<i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i> to the sick of the palsy,)
    </li>
    <li>I <i>cackle</i> unto thee, Arise, and <i>lell</i> up thy bed, and <i>troll</i> thy way into thine <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And immediately <i>she</i> arose, <i>lelled</i> up the bed, and <i>trolled</i> forth before them all; insomuch that they were all <i>gobsmacked</i>, and glorified <i>Gloria</i>, <i>cackling</i>, We never <i>vardad</i> it on this fashion.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto <i>her</i>, and <i>she</i> taught them.
    </li>
    <li>And as <i>she</i> <i>trolled by</i>, <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> Levi the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>troll after</i> me. And <i>she</i> arose and <i>trolled after</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, that, as <i>Josie</i> sat at <i>carnish</i> in <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>, many <i>landladies</i> and <i>kerterverers</i> sat also together with <i>Josie</i> and <i>her</i> disciples: for there were many, and they <i>trolled after</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>betty bracelets</i> and <i>lily laws</i> <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i> <i>jarry</i> with <i>landladies</i> and <i>kerterverers</i>, they <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> disciples, How is it that <i>she</i> eateth and <i>buvareth</i> with <i>landladies</i> and <i>kerterverers</i>?
    </li>
    <li>When <i>Josie</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> it, <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i> unto them, They that are whole have no need of the <i>crocus</i>, but they that are sick: I <i>trolled</i> not to <i>screech</i> the <i>bona</i>, but <i>kerterverers</i> to repentance.
    </li>
    <li>And the disciples of <i>Jane</i> and of the <i>lily laws</i> used to <i>nishta manjarry</i>: and they <i>troll</i> and <i>cackle</i> unto <i>her</i>, Why do the disciples of <i>Jane</i> and of the <i>lily laws</i> <i>nishta manjarry</i>, but thy disciples <i>nishta manjarry</i> not?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Can the <i>chavvies</i> of the bridechamber <i>nishta manjarry</i>, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot <i>nishta manjarry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But the days will <i>troll</i>, when the bridegroom shall be <i>lelled</i> away from them, and then shall they <i>nishta manjarry</i> in those days.
    </li>
    <li>No <i>homie</i> also seweth a piece of new cloth on an <i>badge</i> <i>frock</i>: else the new piece that filled it up <i>lelleth</i> away from the <i>badge</i>, and the rent is made worse.
    </li>
    <li>And no <i>homie</i> <i>laueth</i> new <i>sherry</i> into <i>badge</i> <i>schooners</i>: else the new <i>sherry</i> doth burst the <i>schooners</i>, and the <i>sherry</i> is spilled, and the <i>schooners</i> will be marred: but new <i>sherry</i> must be put into new <i>schooners</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, that <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> through the corn fields on the sabbath <i>journo</i>; and <i>her</i> disciples began, as they <i>trolled</i>, to pluck the <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> of corn.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>lily laws</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>varda</i>, why do they on the sabbath <i>journo</i> that which is not lawful?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Have ye never <i>varda the lavs</i> what <i>Davina</i> did, when <i>she</i> had need, and was an hungred, <i>she</i>, and they that were with <i>her</i>?
    </li>
    <li>How <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> into the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> in the days of Abiathar the high <i>godly homie</i>, and did <i>jarry</i> the shewbread, which is not lawful to <i>jarry</i> but for the <i>godly homies</i>, and <i>parkered</i> also to them which were with <i>her</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, The sabbath was made for <i>homie</i>, and not <i>homie</i> for the sabbath:
    </li>
    <li>Therefore the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> is <i>Duchess</i> also of the sabbath.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And <i>she</i> entered again into the synagogue; and there was a <i>homie</i> there which had a withered <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they watched <i>her</i>, whether <i>she</i> would heal <i>her</i> on the sabbath <i>journo</i>; that they might accuse <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i> unto the <i>homie</i> which had the withered <i>famble</i>, Stand forth.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i> unto them, Is it lawful to do <i>bona</i> on the sabbath days, or to do <i>nana</i>? to save life, or to <i>ferricadoza</i>? But they held their peace.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> had looked round about on them with <i>wild</i>, being grieved for the hardness of their <i>thumping cheats</i>, <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i> unto the <i>homie</i>, Stretch forth thine <i>famble</i>. And <i>she</i> stretched it out: and <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> was restored whole as the other.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>lily laws</i> <i>trolled</i> forth, and straightway <i>lelled</i> counsel with the Herodians against <i>her</i>, how they might <i>battyfang</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>Josie</i> withdrew himself with <i>her</i> disciples to the sea: and a <i>dowry</i> multitude from Galilee <i>trolled after</i> <i>her</i>, and from Judaea,
    </li>
    <li>And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a <i>dowry</i> multitude, when they had <i>aunt nelled</i> what <i>dowry</i> <i>fakements</i> <i>she</i> did, <i>trolled</i> unto <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> to <i>her</i> disciples, that a <i>pogey</i> <i>lattie on water</i> should wait on <i>her</i> because of the multitude, lest they should throng <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon <i>her</i> for to <i>reef</i> <i>her</i>, as many as had plagues.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>nanti sparkle</i> <i>fairies</i>, when they <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i>, fell down before <i>her</i>, and <i>screeched</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Thou art the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>hettily</i> charged them that they should not make <i>her</i> known.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> goeth up into a mountain, and <i>screecheth</i> unto <i>her</i> whom <i>she</i> would: and they <i>trolled</i> unto <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> ordained <i>kenza</i>, that they should be with <i>her</i>, and that <i>she</i> might <i>lau</i> them forth to <i>cackle</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Simone</i> <i>she</i> surnamed <i>Petra</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And James the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Zebedee, and <i>Jane</i> the <i>sister</i> of James; and <i>she</i> surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The <i>homie chavvies</i> of thunder:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Andrea</i>, and <i>Phyllis</i>, and Bartholomew, and <i>Matilda</i>, and Thomas, and James the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and <i>Simone</i> the Canaanite,
    </li>
    <li>And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed <i>her</i>: and they <i>trolled</i> into an <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the multitude <i>trolleth</i> together again, so that they could not so <i>dowry</i> as <i>jarry</i> <i>pannan</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>her</i> <i>bencoves</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> of it, they <i>trolled</i> out to <i>lett</i> hold on <i>her</i>: for they <i>cackled</i>, <i>she</i> is beside himself.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>betty bracelets</i> which <i>trolled</i> down from Jerusalem <i>cackled</i>, <i>she</i> hath Beelzebub, and by the <i>princess</i> of the devils casteth <i>she</i> out devils.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> them unto <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto them in parables, How can <i>Sadie</i> cast out <i>Sadie</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And if a kingdom be <i>medzered</i> against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
    </li>
    <li>And if a <i>lattie</i> be <i>medzered</i> against itself, that <i>lattie</i> cannot stand.
    </li>
    <li>And if <i>Sadie</i> rise up against himself, and be <i>medzered</i>, <i>she</i> cannot stand, but hath an end.
    </li>
    <li>No <i>homie</i> can enter into a <i>manly alice</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, and spoil <i>her</i> goods, except <i>she</i> will first bind the <i>manly alice</i>; and then <i>she</i> will spoil <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Verily I <i>cackle</i> unto you, All <i>kertervers</i> shall be forgiven unto the <i>homie chavvies</i> of <i>homies</i>, and <i>billingsgates</i> wherewith soever they shall blaspheme:
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> that shall blaspheme against the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i> hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation.
    </li>
    <li>Because they <i>cackled</i>, <i>she</i> hath an <i>nanti sparkle</i> <i>Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>There <i>trolled</i> then <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i> and <i>her</i> mother, and, standing <i>nanti</i>, <i>laued</i> unto <i>her</i>, calling <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the multitude sat about <i>her</i>, and they <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>varda</i>, thy mother and thy <i>sisters</i> <i>nanti</i> <i>charper</i> for thee.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> answered them, <i>cackling</i>, Who is my mother, or my <i>sisters</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> looked round about on them which sat about <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i> my mother and my <i>sisters</i>!
    </li>
    <li>For whosoever shall do the will of <i>Gloria</i>, the same is my <i>sister</i>, and my sister, and mother.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And <i>she</i> began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto <i>her</i> a <i>dowry</i> multitude, so that <i>she</i> entered into a <i>lattie on water</i>, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> taught them many <i>fakements</i> by parables, and <i>cackled</i> unto them in <i>her</i> doctrine,
    </li>
    <li><i>Aunt nell</i>; <i>varda</i>, there <i>trolled</i> out a sower to sow:
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, as <i>she</i> sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air <i>trolled</i> and devoured it up.
    </li>
    <li>And some fell on stony ground, where it had not <i>dowry</i> earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:
    </li>
    <li>But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.
    </li>
    <li>And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.
    </li>
    <li>And other fell on <i>bona</i> ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some <i>trey dacha</i>, and some <i>sey dacha</i>, and some an <i>chenter</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>she</i> that hath <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> to <i>aunt nell</i>, let <i>her</i> <i>aunt nell</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> was alone, they that were about <i>her</i> with the <i>kenza</i> asked of <i>her</i> the parable.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Unto you it is <i>parkered</i> to know the mystery of the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>: but unto them that are <i>nanti</i>, all these <i>fakements</i> are done in parables:
    </li>
    <li>That <i>vardaing</i> they may <i>varda</i>, and not perceive; and hearing they may <i>aunt nell</i>, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their <i>kertervers</i> should be forgiven them.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?
    </li>
    <li>The sower soweth the <i>lav</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And these are they by the way side, where the <i>lav</i> is sown; but when they have <i>aunt nelled</i>, <i>Sadie</i> <i>trolleth</i> immediately, and <i>lelleth</i> away the <i>lav</i> that was sown in their <i>thumping cheats</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>lav</i>, immediately <i>lall</i> it with gladness;
    </li>
    <li>And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or <i>chivvying</i> ariseth for the <i>lav</i>&#8216;s sake, immediately they are offended.
    </li>
    <li>And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as <i>aunt nell</i> the <i>lav</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other <i>fakements</i> entering in, choke the <i>lav</i>, and it becometh unfruitful.
    </li>
    <li>And these are they which are sown on <i>bona</i> ground; such as <i>aunt nell</i> the <i>lav</i>, and <i>lall</i> it, and <i>parker</i> forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some <i>sey dacha</i>, and some an <i>chenter</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?
    </li>
    <li>For there is <i>nishter</i> hid, which shall not be manifested; <i>nishta</i> was any <i>fakement</i> kept secret, but that it should <i>troll</i> abroad.
    </li>
    <li>If any <i>homie</i> have <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> to <i>aunt nell</i>, let <i>her</i> <i>aunt nell</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>lell</i> heed what ye <i>aunt nell</i>: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that <i>aunt nell</i> shall more be <i>parkered</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> that hath, to <i>her</i> shall be <i>parkered</i>: and <i>she</i> that hath not, from <i>her</i> shall be <i>lelled</i> even that which <i>she</i> hath.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, So is the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>, as if a <i>homie</i> should cast <i>maria</i> into the ground;
    </li>
    <li>And should <i>letty</i>, and rise <i>nochy</i> and <i>journo</i>, and the <i>maria</i> should spring and grow up, <i>she</i> knoweth not how.
    </li>
    <li>For the earth <i>parkereth</i> forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the <i>aunt nelling cheat</i>, after that the full corn in the <i>aunt nelling cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately <i>she</i> <i>laueth</i> in the sickle, because the harvest is <i>troll</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>? or with what comparison shall we compare it?
    </li>
    <li>It is like a grain of mustard <i>maria</i>, which, when it is sown in the earth, is <i>nanti dowry</i> than all the seeds that be in the earth:
    </li>
    <li>But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh <i>dowrier</i> than all herbs, and shooteth out <i>dowry</i> branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.
    </li>
    <li>And with many such parables <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i> the <i>lav</i> unto them, as they were able to <i>aunt nell</i> it.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>nanti</i> a parable <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i> not unto them: and when they were alone, <i>she</i> expounded all <i>fakements</i> to <i>her</i> disciples.
    </li>
    <li>And the same <i>journo</i>, when the even was <i>troll</i>, <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i> unto them, Let us <i>troll over</i> unto the other side.
    </li>
    <li>And when they had <i>laued</i> away the multitude, they <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> even as <i>she</i> was in the <i>lattie on water</i>. And there were also with <i>her</i> other <i>bijou</i> <i>latties on water</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And there arose a <i>dowry</i> storm of wind, and the waves <i>zsa zsa-ed</i> into the <i>lattie on water</i>, so that it was now full.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> was in the hinder part of the <i>lattie on water</i>, asleep on a pillow: and they awake <i>her</i>, and <i>cackle</i> unto <i>her</i>, Master, carest thou not that we perish?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> arose, and rebuked the wind, and <i>cackled</i> unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a <i>dowry</i> calm.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?
    </li>
    <li>And they feared exceedingly, and <i>cackled</i> <i>una</i> to another, What manner of <i>homie</i> is this, that even the wind and the sea obey <i>her</i>?
    </li>

    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And they <i>trolled</i> over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> was <i>troll</i> out of the <i>lattie on water</i>, immediately there met <i>her</i> out of the tombs a <i>homie</i> with an <i>nanti sparkle</i> <i>Fairy</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Who had <i>her</i> dwelling among the tombs; and no <i>homie</i> could bind <i>her</i>, no, not with chains:
    </li>
    <li>Because that <i>she</i> had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by <i>her</i>, and the fetters broken in pieces: <i>nishta</i> could any <i>homie</i> tame <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And always, <i>nochy</i> and <i>journo</i>, <i>she</i> was in the mountains, and in the tombs, <i>screeching</i>, and cutting himself with stones.
    </li>
    <li>But when <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>nishta ajax</i> off, <i>she</i> ran and worshipped <i>her</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>screeched</i> with a loud <i>cackling fakement</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, What have I to do with thee, <i>Josie</i>, thou <i>homie chavvie</i> of the most high <i>Gloria</i>? I adjure thee by <i>Gloria</i>, that thou torment me not.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>troll</i> out of the <i>homie</i>, thou <i>nanti sparkle</i> <i>Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> asked <i>her</i>, What is thy name? And <i>she</i> answered, <i>cackling</i>, My name is Legion: for we are many.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> besought <i>her</i> <i>dowry</i> that <i>she</i> would not <i>lau</i> them away out of the country.
    </li>
    <li>Now there was there <i>ajax</i> unto the mountains a <i>dowry</i> herd of swine feeding.

    <li>And all the devils besought <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>lau</i> us into the swine, that we may enter into them.
    </li>
    <li>And forthwith <i>Josie</i> <i>parkered</i> them leave. And the <i>nanti sparkle</i> <i>fairies</i> <i>trolled</i> out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about <i>dewey</i> <i>mille</i>😉 and were choked in the sea.
    </li>
    <li>And they that fed the swine fled, and <i>cackled</i> it in the <i>smoke</i>, and in the country. And they <i>trolled</i> out to <i>varda</i> what it was that was done.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>troll</i> to <i>Josie</i>, and <i>varda</i> <i>her</i> that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in <i>her</i> <i>sweet</i> mind: and they were afraid.
    </li>
    <li>And they that <i>vardad</i> it <i>cackled</i> them how it befell to <i>her</i> that was possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine.
    </li>
    <li>And they began to pray <i>her</i> to <i>troll off</i> out of their coasts.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> was <i>troll</i> into the <i>lattie on water</i>, <i>she</i> that had been possessed with the devil prayed <i>her</i> that <i>she</i> might be with <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Howbeit <i>Josie</i> suffered <i>her</i> not, but <i>cackleth</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>troll</i> home to thy <i>bencoves</i>, and <i>cackle</i> them how <i>dowry</i> <i>fakements</i> the <i>Duchess</i> hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled off</i>, and began to publish in Decapolis how <i>dowry</i> <i>fakements</i> <i>Josie</i> had done for <i>her</i>: and all <i>homies</i> did marvel.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>Josie</i> was passed over again by <i>lattie on water</i> unto the other side, <i>dowry</i> <i>homies and palones</i> gathered unto <i>her</i>: and <i>she</i> was <i>ajax</i> unto the sea.
    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, there <i>trolleth</i> <i>una</i> of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> fell at <i>her</i> <i>plates</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And besought <i>her</i> greatly, <i>cackling</i>, My <i>bijou</i> <i>palone chavvie</i> <i>lettieth</i> at the point of <i>carking it</i>: I pray thee, <i>troll</i> and <i>lett</i> thy <i>fambles</i> on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> <i>trolled</i> with <i>her</i>; and <i>dowry</i> <i>homies and palones</i> <i>trolled after</i> <i>her</i>, and thronged <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And a certain <i>palone</i>, which had an issue of blood <i>kenza</i> years,
    </li>
    <li>And had suffered many <i>fakements</i> of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was <i>nishter</i> bettered, but rather grew worse,
    </li>
    <li>When she had <i>aunt nelled</i> of <i>Josie</i>, <i>trolled</i> in the press behind, and <i>reefed</i> <i>her</i> <i>frock</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For she <i>cackled</i>, If I may <i>reef</i> but <i>her</i> <i>zhoosh</i>, I shall be whole.
    </li>
    <li>And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her <i>lucoddy</i> that she was healed of that plague.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i>, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had <i>trolled</i> out of <i>her</i>, turned <i>her</i> about in the press, and <i>cackled</i>, Who <i>reefed</i> my <i>zhoosh</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>her</i> disciples <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Thou <i>vardest</i> the multitude thronging thee, and <i>cackleth</i> thou, Who <i>reefed</i> me?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> looked round about to <i>varda</i> her that had done this <i>fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>palone</i> fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, <i>trolled</i> and fell down before <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i> <i>her</i> all the truth.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto her, <i>palone chavvie</i>, thy faith hath made thee whole; <i>sling yer hook</i>, and be whole of thy plague.
    </li>
    <li>While <i>she</i> yet <i>cackled</i>, there <i>trolled</i> from the ruler of the synagogue&#8217;s <i>lattie</i> certain which <i>cackled</i>, Thy <i>palone chavvie</i> is <i>stiff</i>: why troublest thou the Master any further?
    </li>
    <li>As soon as <i>Josie</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>lav</i> that was <i>cackled</i>, <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i> unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> suffered no <i>homie</i> to <i>troll after</i> <i>her</i>, save <i>Petra</i>, and James, and <i>Jane</i> the <i>sister</i> of James.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolleth</i> to the <i>lattie</i> of the ruler of the synagogue, and <i>vardaeth</i> the tumult, and them that <i>parnied</i> and wailed greatly.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> was <i>troll</i> in, <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i> unto them, Why make ye this ado, and <i>parnie</i>? the damsel is not <i>stiff</i>, but sleepeth.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>tittered</i> <i>her</i> to scorn. But when <i>she</i> had put them all out, <i>she</i> <i>lelleth</i> the <i>Auntie</i> and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with <i>her</i>, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> the damsel by the <i>famble</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I <i>cackle</i> unto thee, arise.
    </li>
    <li>And straightway the damsel arose, and <i>minced</i>; for she was of the age of <i>kenza</i> years. And they were <i>gobsmacked</i> with a <i>dowry</i> <i>gobsmacked-ness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> charged them <i>hettily</i> that no <i>homie</i> should know it; and commanded that something should be <i>parkered</i> her to <i>jarry</i>.

    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> out from thence, and <i>trolled</i> into <i>her</i> own country; and <i>her</i> disciples <i>troll after</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when the sabbath <i>journo</i> was <i>troll</i>, <i>she</i> began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing <i>her</i> were <i>gobsmacked</i>, <i>cackling</i>, From whence hath this <i>homie</i> these <i>fakements</i>? and what wisdom is this which is <i>parkered</i> unto <i>her</i>, that even such <i>dowry butch</i> works are wrought by <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Is not this the carpenter, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Mary, the <i>sister</i> of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and <i>Simone</i>? and are not <i>her</i> sisters here with us? And they were offended at <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>Josie</i>, <i>cackled</i> unto them, A prophet is not <i>nanti</i> honour, but in <i>her</i> own country, and among <i>her</i> own kin, and in <i>her</i> own <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> could there do no <i>dowry butch</i> <i>acting dickey</i>, save that <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i> upon a <i>nishta dowry</i> sick folk, and healed them.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> marvelled because of their unbelief. And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> round about the villages, teaching.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> unto <i>her</i> the <i>kenza</i>, and began to <i>lau</i> them forth by <i>dewey</i> and <i>dewey</i>; and <i>parkered</i> them power over <i>nanti sparkle</i> <i>fairies</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And commanded them that they should <i>lell</i> <i>nishter</i> for their journey, save a <i>trolling fakement</i> only; no scrip, no <i>pannan</i>, no <i>dinarly</i> in their purse:
    </li>
    <li>But be shod with sandals; and not put on <i>dewey</i> coats.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an <i>lattie</i>, there <i>lett</i> till ye <i>troll off</i> from that place.
    </li>
    <li>And whosoever shall not <i>lall</i> you, <i>nishta</i> <i>aunt nell</i> you, when ye <i>troll off</i> thence, shake off the dust under your <i>plates</i> for a testimony against them. Verily I <i>cackle</i> unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the <i>journo</i> of judgment, than for that <i>smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>trolled</i> out, and <i>cackled</i> that <i>homies</i> should repent.
    </li>
    <li>And they cast out many devils, and anointed with <i>lube</i> many that were sick, and healed them.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>dowriest homie</i> Herod <i>aunt nelled</i> of <i>her</i>; (for <i>her</i> name was spread abroad:) and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, That <i>Jane</i> the Baptist was risen from the <i>stiff</i>, and therefore <i>dowry butch</i> works do shew forth themselves in <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Others <i>cackled</i>, That it is Elias. And others <i>cackled</i>, That it is a prophet, or as <i>una</i> of the prophets.
    </li>
    <li>But when Herod <i>aunt nelled</i> thereof, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, It is <i>Jane</i>, whom I beheaded: <i>she</i> is risen from the <i>stiff</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For Herod himself had <i>laued</i> forth and <i>laued</i> hold upon <i>Jane</i>, and bound <i>her</i> in <i>charpering carsey</i> for Herodias&#8217; sake, <i>her</i> <i>sister</i> <i>Phyllis</i>&#8216;s <i>palone affair</i>: for <i>she</i> had married her.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>Jane</i> had <i>cackled</i> unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy <i>sister</i>&#8216;s <i>palone affair</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against <i>her</i>, and would have <i>ferricadozad</i> <i>her</i>; but she could not:
    </li>
    <li>For Herod feared <i>Jane</i>, knowing that <i>she</i> was a just <i>homie</i> and an <i>fabulosa</i>, and observed <i>her</i>; and when <i>she</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> did many <i>fakements</i>, and <i>aunt nelled</i> <i>her</i> gladly.
    </li>
    <li>And when a convenient <i>journo</i> was <i>troll</i>, that Herod on <i>her</i> birthday made a supper to <i>her</i> <i>ladies</i>, high captains, and <i>dowriest</i> estates of Galilee;
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>palone chavvie</i> of the <i>cackled</i> Herodias <i>trolled</i> in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with <i>her</i>, the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will <i>parker</i> it thee.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will <i>parker</i> it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.
    </li>
    <li>And she <i>trolled</i> forth, and <i>cackled</i> unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she <i>cackled</i>, The <i>eke</i> of <i>Jane</i> the Baptist.
    </li>
    <li>And she <i>trolled</i> in straightway with haste unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and asked, <i>cackling</i>, I will that thou <i>parker</i> me by and by in a charger the <i>eke</i> of <i>Jane</i> the Baptist.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> was exceeding sorry; yet for <i>her</i> oath&#8217;s sake, and for their sakes which sat with <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> would not reject her.
    </li>
    <li>And immediately the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>laued</i> an executioner, and commanded <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> to be brought: and <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> and beheaded <i>her</i> in the <i>charpering carsey</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And brought <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> in a charger, and <i>parkered</i> it to the damsel: and the damsel <i>parkered</i> it to her mother.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>her</i> disciples <i>aunt nelled</i> of it, they <i>trolled</i> and <i>lelled</i> up <i>her</i> corpse, and <i>laued</i> it in a tomb.
    </li>
    <li>And the apostles gathered themselves together unto <i>Josie</i>, and <i>cackled</i> <i>her</i> all <i>fakements</i>, both what they had done, and what they had taught.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>troll</i> ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and <i>lettie</i> a while: for there were many <i>trolling</i> and going, and they had no leisure so <i>dowry</i> as to <i>jarry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>trolled off</i> into a desert place by <i>lattie on water</i> privately.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>vardad</i> them departing, and many knew <i>her</i>, and ran afoot thither out of all <i>smokes</i>, and outwent them, and <i>trolled</i> together unto <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i>, when <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> out, <i>vardad</i> <i>dowry</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, and was <i>trolled</i> with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and <i>she</i> began to teach them many <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>journo</i> was now far spent, <i>her</i> disciples <i>trolled</i> unto <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed:
    </li>
    <li><i>Lau</i> them away, that they may <i>troll</i> into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves <i>pannan</i>: for they have <i>nishter</i> to <i>jarry</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> answered and <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>parker</i> ye them to <i>jarry</i>. And they <i>cackle</i> unto <i>her</i>, Shall we <i>troll</i> and buy <i>dewey</i> <i>chenter</i> pennyworth of <i>pannan</i>, and <i>parker</i> them to <i>jarry</i>?
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> <i>cackleth</i> unto them, How many loaves have ye? <i>troll</i> and <i>varda</i>. And when they knew, they <i>cackle</i>, <i>chinker</i>, and <i>dewey</i> fishes.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> commanded them to make all <i>lett</i> down by companies upon the green grass.
    </li>
    <li>And they sat down in ranks, by <i>chenters</i>, and by fifties.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> had <i>lelled</i> the <i>chinker</i> loaves and the <i>dewey</i> fishes, <i>she</i> looked up to heaven, and <i>fabed</i>, and brake the loaves, and <i>parkered</i> them to <i>her</i> disciples to set before them; and the <i>dewey</i> fishes <i>medzered</i> <i>she</i> among them all.
    </li>
    <li>And they did all <i>jarry</i>, and were filled.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>lelled</i> up <i>kenza</i> baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.
    </li>
    <li>And they that did <i>jarry</i> of the loaves were about <i>chinker</i> <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And straightway <i>she</i> constrained <i>her</i> disciples to get into the <i>lattie on water</i>, and to <i>troll</i> to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> away the <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> had <i>laued</i> them away, <i>she</i> <i>trolled off</i> into a mountain to pray.
    </li>
    <li>And when even was <i>troll</i>, the <i>lattie on water</i> was in the midst of the sea, and <i>she</i> alone on the land.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the <i>quarter</i> <i>varda</i> of the <i>nochy</i> <i>she</i> <i>trolleth</i> unto them, <i>mincing</i> upon the sea, and would have <i>trolled by</i> them.
    </li>
    <li>But when they <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i> <i>mincing</i> upon the sea, they supposed it had been a <i>Fairy</i>, and <i>screeched</i> out:
    </li>
    <li>For they all <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i>, and were troubled. And immediately <i>she</i> talked with them, and <i>cackleth</i> unto them, Be of <i>bona</i> cheer: it is I; be not afraid.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> up unto them into the <i>lattie on water</i>; and the wind ceased: and they were sore <i>gobsmacked</i> in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.
    </li>
    <li>For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their <i>thumping cheat</i> was hardened.
    </li>
    <li>And when they had passed over, they <i>trolled</i> into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.
    </li>
    <li>And when they were <i>troll</i> out of the <i>lattie on water</i>, straightway they knew <i>her</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they <i>aunt nelled</i> <i>she</i> was.
    </li>
    <li>And whithersoever <i>she</i> entered, into villages, or <i>smokes</i>, or country, they <i>laued</i> the sick in the streets, and besought <i>her</i> that they might <i>reef</i> if it were but the border of <i>her</i> <i>frock</i>: and as many as <i>reefed</i> <i>her</i> were made whole.

    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>

    <li>Then <i>trolled</i> together unto <i>her</i> the <i>lily laws</i>, and certain of the <i>betty bracelets</i>, which <i>trolled</i> from Jerusalem.

    <li>And when they <i>vardad</i> some of <i>her</i> disciples <i>jarry</i> <i>pannan</i> with defiled, that is to <i>cackle</i>, with unwashen, <i>fambles</i>, they found fault.

    <li>For the <i>lily laws</i>, and all the <i>kosher homies</i>, except they <i>dhobie</i> their <i>fambles</i> oft, <i>jarry</i> not, holding the tradition of the <i>fungi</i>.

    </li>
    <li>For laying aside the <i>butch lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, ye hold the tradition of <i>homies</i>, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like <i>fakements</i> ye do.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Full well ye reject the <i>butch lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, that ye may keep your own tradition.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>Maureen</i> <i>cackled</i>, Honour thy <i>Auntie</i> and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth <i>Auntie</i> or mother, let <i>her</i> <i>cark it</i> the <i>carking it</i>:
    </li>
    <li>But ye <i>cackle</i>, If a <i>homie</i> shall <i>cackle</i> to <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> or mother, It is Corban, that is to <i>cackle</i>, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; <i>she</i> shall be free.
    </li>
    <li>And ye suffer <i>her</i> <i>nishta</i> to do ought for <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> or <i>her</i> mother;
    </li>
    <li>Making the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i> of none effect through your tradition, which ye have <i>laued</i>: and many such like <i>fakements</i> do ye.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> had <i>screeched</i> all the <i>homies and palones</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>aunt nell</i> unto me every <i>una</i> of you, and understand:
    </li>
    <li>There is <i>nishter</i> from <i>nanti</i> a <i>homie</i>, that entering into <i>her</i> can defile <i>her</i>: but the <i>fakements</i> which <i>troll</i> out of <i>her</i>, those are they that defile the <i>homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>If any <i>homie</i> have <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> to <i>aunt nell</i>, let <i>her</i> <i>aunt nell</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> was entered into the <i>lattie</i> from the <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>her</i> disciples asked <i>her</i> concerning the parable.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i> unto them, Are ye so <i>nanti</i> understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever <i>fakement</i> from <i>nanti</i> entereth into the <i>homie</i>, it cannot defile <i>her</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Because it entereth not into <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, That which <i>trolleth</i> out of the <i>homie</i>, that defileth the <i>homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For from within, out of the <i>thumping cheat</i> of <i>homies</i>, proceed <i>nana</i> thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,
    </li>
    <li>Thefts, <i>ogling</i>, <i>naffness</i>, deceit, lasciviousness, an <i>nana</i> <i>ogle</i>, <i>billingsgate</i>, pride, foolishness:
    </li>
    <li>All these <i>nana</i> <i>fakements</i> <i>troll</i> from within, and defile the <i>homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And from thence <i>she</i> arose, and <i>trolled</i> into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an <i>lattie</i>, and would have no <i>homie</i> know it: but <i>she</i> could not be hid.
    </li>
    <li>For a certain <i>palone</i>, whose <i>bean</i> <i>palone chavvie</i> had an <i>nanti sparkle</i> <i>Fairy</i>, <i>aunt nelled</i> of <i>her</i>, and <i>trolled</i> and fell at <i>her</i> <i>plates</i>:
    </li>
    <li>The <i>palone</i> was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought <i>her</i> that <i>she</i> would cast forth the devil out of her <i>palone chavvie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>Josie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto her, Let the <i>chavvies</i> first be filled: for it is not meet to <i>lell</i> the <i>chavvies</i>&#8216;s <i>pannan</i>, and to cast it unto the <i>women who are not conventionally attractive</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And she answered and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Yes, <i>Duchess</i>: yet the <i>women who are not conventionally attractive</i> under the table <i>jarry</i> of the <i>chavvies</i>&#8216;s crumbs.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto her, For this <i>cackling</i> <i>troll</i> thy way; the devil is <i>trolled</i> out of thy <i>palone chavvie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when she was <i>troll</i> to her <i>lattie</i>, she found the devil <i>trolled</i> out, and her <i>palone chavvie</i> <i>laued</i> upon the bed.
    </li>
    <li>And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>parker</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>una</i> that was <i>nanti nellyarda</i>, and had an impediment in <i>her</i> <i>cackle</i>; and they beseech <i>her</i> to put <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> upon <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> aside from the multitude, and put <i>her</i> <i>luppers</i> into <i>her</i> <i>aunt nelly cheats</i>, and <i>she</i> spit, and <i>reefed</i> <i>her</i> <i>polari</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And looking up to heaven, <i>she</i> sighed, and <i>cackleth</i> unto <i>her</i>, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.
    </li>
    <li>And straightway <i>her</i> <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> were opened, and the string of <i>her</i> <i>polari</i> was loosed, and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> plain.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> charged them that they should <i>cackle</i> no <i>homie</i>: but the more <i>she</i> charged them, so <i>dowry</i> the more a <i>dowry</i> deal they published it;
    </li>
    <li>And were beyond measure <i>gobsmacked</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>she</i> hath done all <i>fakements</i> well: <i>she</i> maketh both the <i>nanti nellyarda</i> to <i>aunt nell</i>, and the <i>nanti polari</i> to <i>cackle</i>.

    <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>In those days the multitude being <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry</i>, and having <i>nishter</i> to <i>jarry</i>, <i>Josie</i> <i>screeched</i> <i>her</i> disciples unto <i>her</i>, and <i>cackleth</i> unto them,
    </li>
    <li>I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me <i>trey</i> days, and have <i>nishter</i> to <i>jarry</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And if I <i>lau</i> them away <i>nistha manjarrying</i> to their own <i>latties</i>, they will faint by the way: for divers of them <i>trolled</i> from far.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>her</i> disciples answered <i>her</i>, From whence can a <i>homie</i> satisfy these <i>homies</i> with <i>pannan</i> here in the <i>nishta smoke</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they <i>cackled</i>, <i>setter</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> commanded the <i>homies and palones</i> to <i>lett</i> down on the ground: and <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> the <i>setter</i> loaves, and <i>parkered</i> thanks, and brake, and <i>parkered</i> to <i>her</i> disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they had a <i>nishta dowry</i> <i>pogey</i> fishes: and <i>she</i> <i>fabed</i>, and commanded to set them also before them.
    </li>
    <li>So they did <i>jarry</i>, and were filled: and they <i>lelled</i> up of the broken <i>carnish</i> that was <i>dry</i> <i>setter</i> baskets.
    </li>
    <li>And they that had <i>jarried</i> were about <i>quarter</i> <i>mille</i>: and <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> them away.
    </li>
    <li>And straightway <i>she</i> entered into a <i>lattie on water</i> with <i>her</i> disciples, and <i>trolled</i> into the parts of Dalmanutha.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>lily laws</i> <i>trolled</i> forth, and began to question with <i>her</i>, seeking of <i>her</i> a sign from heaven, tempting <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> sighed deeply in <i>her</i> <i>Fairy</i>, and <i>cackleth</i>, Why doth this generation <i>charper</i> after a sign? verily I <i>cackle</i> unto you, There shall no sign be <i>parkered</i> unto this generation.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>dry</i> them, and entering into the <i>lattie on water</i> again <i>trolled off</i> to the other side.
    </li>
    <li>Now the disciples had forgotten to <i>lell</i> <i>pannan</i>, <i>nishta</i> had they in the <i>lattie on water</i> with them more than <i>una</i> loaf.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> charged them, <i>cackling</i>, <i>lell</i> heed, <i>gardy loo</i> of the leaven of the <i>lily laws</i>, and of the leaven of Herod.
    </li>
    <li>And they reasoned among themselves, <i>cackling</i>, It is because we have no <i>pannan</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>Josie</i> knew it, <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i> unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no <i>pannan</i>? perceive ye not yet, <i>nishta</i> understand? have ye your <i>thumping cheat</i> yet hardened?
    </li>
    <li>Having <i>ogles</i>, <i>varda</i> ye not? and having <i>aunt nelly cheats</i>, <i>aunt nell</i> ye not? and do ye not remember?
    </li>
    <li>When I brake the <i>chinker</i> loaves among <i>chinker</i> <i>mille</i>, how many baskets full of fragments <i>lelled</i> ye up? They <i>cackle</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>kenza</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>setter</i> among <i>quarter</i> <i>mille</i>, how many baskets full of fragments <i>lelled</i> ye up? And they <i>cackled</i>, <i>setter</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, How is it that ye <i>nix</i> understand?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolleth</i> to Bethsaida; and they <i>parker</i> a <i>nanti varda</i> <i>homie</i> unto <i>her</i>, and besought <i>her</i> to <i>reef</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> the <i>nanti varda</i> <i>homie</i> by the <i>famble</i>, and led <i>her</i> out of the town; and when <i>she</i> had spit on <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i>, and put <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i> upon <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> asked <i>her</i> if <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> ought.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> looked up, and <i>cackled</i>, I <i>varda</i> <i>homies</i> as trees, <i>mincing</i>.

    <li>After that <i>she</i> put <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i> again upon <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i>, and made <i>her</i> <i>varda</i> up: and <i>she</i> was restored, and <i>vardad</i> every <i>homie</i> clearly.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> away to <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>troll</i> into the town, <i>nishta</i> <i>cackle</i> it to any in the town.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> <i>trolled</i> out, and <i>her</i> disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way <i>she</i> asked <i>her</i> disciples, <i>cackling</i> unto them, Whom do <i>homies</i> <i>cackle</i> that I am?
    </li>
    <li>And they answered, <i>Jane</i> the Baptist; but some <i>cackle</i>, Elias; and others, <i>una</i> of the prophets.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i> unto them, But whom <i>cackle</i> ye that I am? And <i>Petra</i> answereth and <i>cackleth</i> unto <i>her</i>, Thou art the <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> charged them that they should <i>cackle</i> no <i>homie</i> of <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> began to teach them, that the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> must suffer many <i>fakements</i>, and be rejected of the <i>fungi</i>, and of the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homies</i>, and <i>betty bracelets</i>, and be <i>ferricadozad</i>, and after <i>trey</i> days rise again.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> that <i>cackling</i> openly. And <i>Petra</i> <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i>, and began to rebuke <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But when <i>she</i> had turned about and looked on <i>her</i> disciples, <i>she</i> rebuked <i>Petra</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>Get her</i>: for thou savourest not the <i>fakements</i> that be of <i>Gloria</i>, but the <i>fakements</i> that be of <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> had <i>screeched</i> the <i>homies and palones</i> unto <i>her</i> with <i>her</i> disciples also, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Whosoever will <i>troll</i> after me, let <i>her</i> deny himself, and <i>lell</i> up <i>her</i> cross, and <i>troll after</i> me.
    </li>
    <li>For whosoever will save <i>her</i> life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose <i>her</i> life for my sake and the <i>gossip</i>&#8216;s, the same shall save it.
    </li>
    <li>For what shall it profit a <i>homie</i>, if <i>she</i> shall gain the whole world, and lose <i>her</i> own <i>nishta lucoddy</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Or what shall a <i>homie</i> <i>parker</i> in exchange for <i>her</i> <i>nishta lucoddy</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my <i>lavs</i> in this adulterous and sinful generation; of <i>her</i> also shall the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> be ashamed, when <i>she</i> <i>trolleth</i> in the <i>fabeness</i> of <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> with the <i>fabulosa</i> <i>fairies</i>.

    <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Verily I <i>cackle</i> unto you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of <i>carking it</i>, till they have <i>vardad</i> the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i> <i>troll</i> with power.
    </li>
    <li>And after <i>sey</i> days <i>Josie</i> <i>lelleth</i> with <i>her</i> <i>Petra</i>, and James, and <i>Jane</i>, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and <i>she</i> was transfigured before them.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>her</i> <i>clobber</i> became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them.
    </li>
    <li>And there appeared unto them Elias with <i>Maureen</i>: and they were talking with <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Petra</i> answered and <i>cackled</i> to <i>Josie</i>, Master, it is <i>bona</i> for us to be here: and let us make <i>trey</i> <i>bijoux tabernaclettes</i>; <i>una</i> for thee, and <i>una</i> for <i>Maureen</i>, and <i>una</i> for Elias.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> wist not what to <i>cackle</i>; for they were sore afraid.
    </li>
    <li>And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a <i>cackling fakement</i> <i>trolled</i> out of the cloud, <i>cackling</i>, This is my beloved <i>homie chavvie</i>: <i>aunt nell</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they <i>vardad</i> no <i>homie</i> any more, save <i>Josie</i> only with themselves.
    </li>
    <li>And as they <i>trolled</i> down from the mountain, <i>she</i> charged them that they should <i>cackle</i> no <i>homie</i> what <i>fakements</i> they had <i>vardad</i>, till the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> were risen from the <i>stiff</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they kept that <i>cackling</i> with themselves, questioning <i>una</i> with another what the rising from the <i>stiff</i> should mean.
    </li>
    <li>And they asked <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Why <i>cackle</i> the <i>betty bracelets</i> that Elias must first <i>troll</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> answered and <i>cackled</i> them, Elias verily <i>trolleth</i> first, and restoreth all <i>fakements</i>; and how it is <i>screeved</i> of the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, that <i>she</i> must suffer many <i>fakements</i>, and be set at nought.
    </li>
    <li>But I <i>cackle</i> unto you, That Elias is indeed <i>troll</i>, and they have done unto <i>her</i> whatsoever they listed, as it is <i>screeved</i> of <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> to <i>her</i> disciples, <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> a <i>dowry</i> multitude about them, and the <i>betty bracelets</i> questioning with them.
    </li>
    <li>And straightway all the <i>homies and palones</i>, when they beheld <i>her</i>, were greatly <i>gobsmacked</i>, and <i>trolling</i> to <i>her</i> saluted <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> asked the <i>betty bracelets</i>, What question ye with them?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>una</i> of the multitude answered and <i>cackled</i>, Master, I have brought unto thee my <i>homie chavvie</i>, which hath a <i>nanti polari</i> <i>Fairy</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And wheresoever <i>she</i> <i>lelleth</i> <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> teareth <i>her</i>: and <i>she</i> foameth, and gnasheth with <i>her</i> <i>hampsteads</i>, and pineth away: and I <i>cackled</i> to thy disciples that they should cast <i>her</i> out; and they could not.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> answereth <i>her</i>, and <i>cackleth</i>, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> unto me.
    </li>
    <li>And they brought <i>her</i> unto <i>her</i>: and when <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i>, straightway the <i>Fairy</i> tare <i>her</i>; and <i>she</i> fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> asked <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, How long is it ago since this <i>trolled</i> unto <i>her</i>? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Of a <i>chavvie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And ofttimes it hath cast <i>her</i> into the <i>binco fakement</i>, and into the <i>aquas</i>, to <i>battyfang</i> <i>her</i>: but if thou canst do any <i>fakement</i>, have compassion on us, and help us.
    </li>
    <li><i>Josie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, If thou canst believe, all <i>fakements</i> are possible to <i>her</i> that believeth.
    </li>
    <li>And straightway the <i>Auntie</i> of the <i>chavvie</i> <i>screeched</i> out, and <i>cackled</i> with tears, <i>Duchess</i>, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.

    <li>When <i>Josie</i> <i>vardad</i> that the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>trolled</i> <i>trolling</i> together, <i>she</i> rebuked the foul <i>Fairy</i>, <i>cackling</i> unto <i>her</i>, Thou <i>nanti polari</i> and <i>nanti nellyarda</i> <i>Fairy</i>, I charge thee, <i>troll</i> out of <i>her</i>, and enter <i>nishta</i> into <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Fairy</i> <i>screeched</i>, and rent <i>her</i> sore, and <i>trolled</i> out of <i>her</i>: and <i>she</i> was as <i>una</i> <i>stiff</i>; insomuch that many <i>cackled</i>, <i>she</i> is <i>stiff</i>.

    <li>But <i>Josie</i> <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> by the <i>famble</i>, and lifted <i>her</i> up; and <i>she</i> arose.

    <li>And when <i>she</i> was <i>troll</i> into the <i>lattie</i>, <i>her</i> disciples asked <i>her</i> privately, Why could not we cast <i>her</i> out?

    <li>But they understood not that <i>cackling</i>, and were afraid to ask <i>her</i>.

    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> to Capernaum: and being in the <i>lattie</i> <i>she</i> asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?

    <li>Whosoever shall <i>lall</i> <i>una</i> of such <i>chavvies</i> in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever shall <i>lall</i> me, receiveth not me, but <i>her</i> that <i>laued</i> me.

    <li>And whosoever shall offend <i>una</i> of these <i>bijou</i> ones that believe in me, it is <i>benar</i> for <i>her</i> that a millstone were hanged about <i>her</i> neck, and <i>she</i> were cast into the sea.

    <li>But from the beginning of the creation <i>Gloria</i> made them <i>omee</i> and <i>palone</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For this cause shall a <i>homie</i> leave <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> and mother, and cleave to <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And they twain shall be <i>una</i> flesh: so then they are <i>nishta</i> twain, but <i>una</i> flesh.
    </li>
    <li>What therefore <i>Gloria</i> hath joined together, let not <i>homie</i> put asunder.
    </li>
    <li>And in the <i>lattie</i> <i>her</i> disciples asked <i>her</i> again of the same matter.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i> unto them, Whosoever shall put away <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>, and marry another, committeth adultery against her.
    </li>
    <li>And if a <i>palone</i> shall put away her <i>homie affair</i>, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.
    </li>
    <li>And they brought <i>bean</i> <i>chavvies</i> to <i>her</i>, that <i>she</i> should <i>reef</i> them: and <i>her</i> disciples rebuked those that brought them.
    </li>
    <li>But when <i>Josie</i> <i>vardad</i> it, <i>she</i> was <i>dowry</i> displeased, and <i>cackled</i> unto them, Suffer the <i>bijou</i> <i>chavvies</i> to <i>troll</i> unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Verily I <i>cackle</i> unto you, Whosoever shall not <i>lall</i> the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i> as a <i>bijou</i> <i>chavvie</i>, <i>she</i> shall not enter therein.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> them up in <i>her</i> arms, put <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i> upon them, and <i>fabed</i> them.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> was <i>trolled</i> forth into the way, there <i>trolled</i> <i>una</i> <i>trolling</i>, and kneeled to <i>her</i>, and asked <i>her</i>, <i>bona</i> Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Why callest thou me <i>bona</i>? there is none <i>bona</i> but <i>una</i>, that is, <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thou knowest the <i>butch lavs</i>, <i>nix</i> commit adultery, <i>nix</i> <i>ferricadoza</i>, <i>nix</i> <i>sharper</i>, <i>nix</i> bear false <i>varda-ing fakement</i>, Defraud not, Honour thy <i>Auntie</i> and mother.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> answered and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Master, all these have I observed from my <i>beandom</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>Josie</i> beholding <i>her</i> loved <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>una</i> <i>fakement</i> thou lackest: <i>troll</i> thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and <i>parker</i> to the <i>nanti dinarly</i>, and thou shalt have <i>gelt</i> in heaven: and <i>troll</i>, <i>lell</i> up the cross, and <i>troll after</i> me.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> was sad at that <i>cackling</i>, and <i>trolled</i> away grieved: for <i>she</i> had <i>dowry</i> possessions.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> looked round about, and <i>cackleth</i> unto <i>her</i> disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>!
    </li>
    <li>And the disciples were <i>gobsmacked</i> at <i>her</i> <i>lavs</i>. But <i>Josie</i> answereth again, and <i>cackleth</i> unto them, <i>chavvies</i>, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>!
    </li>
    <li>It is easier for a camel to <i>troll</i> through the <i>ogle</i> of a needle, than for a rich <i>homie</i> to enter into the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they were <i>gobsmacked</i> out of measure, <i>cackling</i> among themselves, Who then can be saved?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> looking upon them <i>cackleth</i>, With <i>homies</i> it is impossible, but not with <i>Gloria</i>: for with <i>Gloria</i> all <i>fakements</i> are possible.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>Petra</i> began to <i>cackle</i> unto <i>her</i>, Lo, we have <i>dry</i> all, and have <i>trolled after</i> thee.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> answered and <i>cackled</i>, Verily I <i>cackle</i> unto you, There is no <i>homie</i> that hath <i>dry</i> <i>lattie</i>, or <i>sisters</i>, or sisters, or <i>Auntie</i>, or mother, or <i>palone affair</i>, or <i>chavvies</i>, or lands, for my sake, and the <i>gossip</i>&#8216;s,
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> shall <i>lall</i> an hundredfold now in this time, <i>latties</i>, and <i>sisters</i>, and sisters, and mothers, and <i>chavvies</i>, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to <i>troll</i> eternal life.
    </li>
    <li>But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.
    </li>
    <li>And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and <i>Josie</i> <i>trolled</i> before them: and they were <i>gobsmacked</i>; and as they <i>trolled after</i>, they were afraid. And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> again the <i>kenza</i>, and began to <i>cackle</i> them what <i>fakements</i> should happen unto <i>her</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackling</i>, <i>varda</i>, we <i>troll</i> up to Jerusalem; and the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> shall be <i>laued</i> unto the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homies</i>, and unto the <i>betty bracelets</i>; and they shall condemn <i>her</i> to <i>carking it</i>, and shall deliver <i>her</i> to the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And they shall mock <i>her</i>, and shall scourge <i>her</i>, and shall spit upon <i>her</i>, and shall <i>ferricadoza</i> <i>her</i>: and the third <i>journo</i> <i>she</i> shall rise again.
    </li>
    <li>And James and <i>Jane</i>, the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Zebedee, <i>troll</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall <i>fancy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?
    </li>
    <li>They <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Grant unto us that we may <i>lett</i>, <i>una</i> on thy <i>sweet martini</i>, and the other on thy <i>dry martini</i>, in thy <i>fabeness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>Josie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye <i>buvare</i> of the cup that I <i>buvare</i> of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, We can. And <i>Josie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Ye shall indeed <i>buvare</i> of the cup that I <i>buvare</i> of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:
    </li>
    <li>But to <i>lett</i> on my <i>sweet martini</i> and on my <i>dry martini</i> is not mine to <i>parker</i>; but it shall be <i>parkered</i> to them for whom it is prepared.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>dacha</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> it, they began to be <i>dowry</i> displeased with James and <i>Jane</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>Josie</i> <i>screeched</i> them to <i>her</i>, and <i>cackleth</i> unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> exercise lordship over them; and their <i>dowry</i> ones exercise authority upon them.
    </li>
    <li>But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be <i>dowry</i> among you, shall be your minister:
    </li>
    <li>And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be <i>serving homie</i> of all.
    </li>
    <li>For even the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> <i>trolled</i> not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> life a ransom for many.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>trolled</i> to Jericho: and as <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> out of Jericho with <i>her</i> disciples and a <i>dowry</i> number of <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>nanti varda</i> Bartimaeus, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> that it was <i>Josie</i> of Nazareth, <i>she</i> began to <i>screech</i> out, and <i>cackle</i>, <i>Josie</i>, thou <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>Davina</i>, have mercy on me.
    </li>
    <li>And many charged <i>her</i> that <i>she</i> should hold <i>her</i> peace: but <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> the more a <i>dowry</i> deal, Thou <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>Davina</i>, have mercy on me.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> stood still, and commanded <i>her</i> to be <i>screeched</i>. And they <i>screech</i> the <i>nanti varda</i> <i>homie</i>, <i>cackling</i> unto <i>her</i>, Be of <i>bona</i> comfort, rise; <i>she</i> <i>screecheth</i> thee.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i>, <i>chucking</i> away <i>her</i> <i>frock</i>, rose, and <i>trolled</i> to <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> answered and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The <i>nanti varda</i> <i>homie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, that I might <i>lall</i> my <i>vardaing</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>troll</i> thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately <i>she</i> <i>lalled</i> <i>her</i> <i>vardaing</i>, and <i>trolled after</i> <i>Josie</i> in the way.

    <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And when they <i>trolled</i> <i>ajax</i> to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, <i>she</i> sendeth forth <i>dewey</i> of <i>her</i> disciples,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackleth</i> unto them, <i>troll</i> your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never <i>homie</i> sat; loose <i>her</i>, and <i>parker</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And if any <i>homie</i> <i>cackle</i> unto you, Why do ye this? <i>cackle</i> ye that the <i>Duchess</i> hath need of <i>her</i>; and straightway <i>she</i> will <i>lau</i> <i>her</i> hither.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>trolled</i> their way, and found the colt tied by the door <i>nanti</i> in a place where <i>dewey</i> ways met; and they loose <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And certain of them that stood there <i>cackled</i> unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>cackled</i> unto them even as <i>Josie</i> had commanded: and they let them <i>troll</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they brought the colt to <i>Josie</i>, and cast their <i>frocks</i> on <i>her</i>; and <i>she</i> sat upon <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And many spread their <i>frocks</i> in the way: and others cut down branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way.
    </li>
    <li>And they that <i>trolled</i> before, and they that <i>trolled after</i>, <i>screeched</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Hosanna; <i>fabed</i> is <i>she</i> that <i>trolleth</i> in the name of the <i>Duchess</i>:
    </li>
    <li><i>Fabed</i> be the kingdom of our <i>Auntie</i> <i>Davina</i>, that <i>trolleth</i> in the name of the <i>Duchess</i>: Hosanna in the highest.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> entered into Jerusalem, and into the <i>holy carsey</i>: and when <i>she</i> had looked round about upon all <i>fakements</i>, and now the eventide was <i>troll</i>, <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> out unto Bethany with the <i>kenza</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And on the morrow, when they were <i>troll</i> from Bethany, <i>she</i> was hungry:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>vardaing</i> a fig tree <i>nishta ajax</i> off having leaves, <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i>, if haply <i>she</i> might find any <i>fakement</i> thereon: and when <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> to it, <i>she</i> found <i>nishter</i> but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> answered and <i>cackled</i> unto it, No <i>homie</i> <i>jarry</i> fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And <i>her</i> disciples <i>aunt nelled</i> it.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>troll</i> to Jerusalem: and <i>Josie</i> <i>trolled</i> into the <i>holy carsey</i>, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the <i>holy carsey</i>, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;
    </li>
    <li>And would not suffer that any <i>homie</i> should carry any <i>fakement</i> through the <i>holy carsey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> taught, <i>cackling</i> unto them, Is it not <i>screeved</i>, My <i>lattie</i> shall be <i>screeched</i> of all nations the <i>lattie</i> of <i>meshigener muttering</i>? but ye have made it a den of <i>sharpering homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>betty bracelets</i> and <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homies</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> it, and sought how they might <i>battyfang</i> <i>her</i>: for they feared <i>her</i>, because all the <i>homies and palones</i> was <i>gobsmacked</i> at <i>her</i> doctrine.
    </li>
    <li>And when even was <i>troll</i>, <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> out of the <i>smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And in the morning, as they <i>trolled by</i>, they <i>vardad</i> the fig tree dried up from the roots.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Petra</i> calling to remembrance <i>cackleth</i> unto <i>her</i>, Master, <i>varda</i>, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> answering <i>cackleth</i> unto them, Have faith in <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For verily I <i>cackle</i> unto you, That whosoever shall <i>cackle</i> unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>, but shall believe that those <i>fakements</i> which <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i> shall <i>troll</i> to pass; <i>she</i> shall have whatsoever <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore I <i>cackle</i> unto you, What <i>fakements</i> soever ye <i>fancy</i>, when ye pray, believe that ye <i>lall</i> them, and ye shall have them.
    </li>
    <li>And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your <i>Auntie</i> also which is in heaven may forgive you your <i>catervers</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But if ye <i>nix</i> forgive, <i>nishta</i> will your <i>Auntie</i> which is in heaven forgive your <i>catervers</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>troll</i> again to Jerusalem: and as <i>she</i> was <i>mincing</i> in the <i>holy carsey</i>, there <i>troll</i> to <i>her</i> the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homies</i>, and the <i>betty bracelets</i>, and the <i>fungi</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackle</i> unto <i>her</i>, By what authority doest thou these <i>fakements</i>? and who <i>parkered</i> thee this authority to do these <i>fakements</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> answered and <i>cackled</i> unto them, I will also ask of you <i>una</i> question, and answer me, and I will <i>cackle</i> you by what authority I do these <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The baptism of <i>Jane</i>, was it from heaven, or of <i>homies</i>? answer me.
    </li>
    <li>And they reasoned with themselves, <i>cackling</i>, If we shall <i>cackle</i>, From heaven; <i>she</i> will <i>cackle</i>, Why then did ye not believe <i>her</i>?
    </li>
    <li>But if we shall <i>cackle</i>, Of <i>homies</i>; they feared the <i>homies and palones</i>: for all <i>homies</i> counted <i>Jane</i>, that <i>she</i> was a prophet indeed.
    </li>
    <li>And they answered and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Josie</i>, We cannot <i>cackle</i>. And <i>Josie</i> answering <i>cackleth</i> unto them, <i>nishta</i> do I <i>cackle</i> you by what authority I do these <i>fakements</i>.

    <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And <i>she</i> began to <i>cackle</i> unto them by parables. A certain <i>homie</i> planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and <i>trolled</i> into a far country.
    </li>
    <li>And at the season <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> to the husbandmen a <i>serving homie</i>, that <i>she</i> might <i>lall</i> from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.
    </li>
    <li>And they caught <i>her</i>, and <i>zsa zsa-ed</i> <i>her</i>, and <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> away empty.
    </li>
    <li>And again <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> unto them another <i>serving homie</i>; and at <i>her</i> they cast stones, and wounded <i>her</i> in the <i>eke</i>, and <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> away shamefully handled.
    </li>
    <li>And again <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> another; and <i>her</i> they <i>ferricadozad</i>, and many others; beating some, and killing some.
    </li>
    <li>Having yet therefore <i>una</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>, <i>her</i> <i>heartface</i>, <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> also last unto them, <i>cackling</i>, They will reverence my <i>homie chavvie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But those husbandmen <i>cackled</i> among themselves, This is the heir; <i>troll</i>, let us <i>ferricadoza</i> <i>her</i>, and the inheritance shall be our&#8217;s.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i>, and <i>ferricadozad</i> <i>her</i>, and cast <i>her</i> out of the vineyard.
    </li>
    <li>What shall therefore the <i>Duchess</i> of the vineyard do? <i>she</i> will <i>troll</i> and <i>battyfang</i> the husbandmen, and will <i>parker</i> the vineyard unto others.
    </li>
    <li>And have ye not <i>varda the lavs</i> this <i>glossy</i>; The stone which the builders rejected is become the <i>eke</i> of the corner:
    </li>
    <li>This was the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s doing, and it is marvellous in our <i>ogles</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And they sought to <i>lett</i> hold on <i>her</i>, but feared the <i>homies and palones</i>: for they knew that <i>she</i> had <i>cackled</i> the parable against them: and they <i>dry</i> <i>her</i>, and <i>trolled</i> their way.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>lau</i> unto <i>her</i> certain of the <i>lily laws</i> and of the Herodians, to catch <i>her</i> in <i>her</i> <i>lavs</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when they were <i>troll</i>, they <i>cackle</i> unto <i>her</i>, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no <i>homie</i>: for thou regardest not the person of <i>homies</i>, but teachest the way of <i>Gloria</i> <i>no flies</i>: Is it lawful to <i>parker</i> tribute to Caesar, or not?
    </li>
    <li>Shall we <i>parker</i>, or shall we not <i>parker</i>? But <i>she</i>, knowing their hypocrisy, <i>cackled</i> unto them, Why tempt ye me? <i>parker</i> me a penny, that I may <i>varda</i> it.
    </li>
    <li>And they brought it. And <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i> unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Caesar&#8217;s.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> answering <i>cackled</i> unto them, Render to Caesar the <i>fakements</i> that are Caesar&#8217;s, and to <i>Gloria</i> the <i>fakements</i> that are <i>Gloria</i>&#8216;s. And they marvelled at <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>troll</i> unto <i>her</i> the Sadducees, which <i>cackle</i> there is no resurrection; and they asked <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Master, <i>Maureen</i> <i>screeved</i> unto us, If a <i>homie</i>&#8216;s <i>sister</i> <i>cark it</i>, and leave <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i> behind <i>her</i>, and leave no <i>chavvies</i>, that <i>her</i> <i>sister</i> should <i>lell</i> <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>, and raise up <i>maria</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>sister</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now there were <i>setter</i> <i>sisters</i>: and the first <i>lelled</i> a <i>palone affair</i>, and dying <i>dry</i> no <i>maria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the second <i>lelled</i> her, and <i>carked it</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>dry</i> <i>she</i> any <i>maria</i>: and the third likewise.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>setter</i> had her, and <i>dry</i> no <i>maria</i>: last of all the <i>palone</i> <i>carked it</i> also.
    </li>
    <li>In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose <i>palone affair</i> shall she be of them? for the <i>setter</i> had her to <i>palone affair</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> answering <i>cackled</i> unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the <i>glossies</i>, <i>nishta</i> the power of <i>Gloria</i>?
    </li>
    <li>For when they shall rise from the <i>stiff</i>, they <i>nishta</i> marry, <i>nishta</i> are <i>parkered</i> in marriage; but are as the <i>fairies</i> which are in heaven.
    </li>
    <li>And as <i>reefing</i> the <i>stiff</i>, that they rise: have ye not <i>varda the lavs</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of <i>Maureen</i>, how in the bush <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, I am the <i>Gloria</i> of Abraham, and the <i>Gloria</i> of Isaac, and the <i>Gloria</i> of Jacob?
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> is not the <i>Gloria</i> of the <i>stiff</i>, but the <i>Gloria</i> of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>una</i> of the <i>betty bracelets</i> <i>trolled</i>, and having <i>aunt nelled</i> them reasoning together, and perceiving that <i>she</i> had answered them well, asked <i>her</i>, Which is the first <i>butch lav</i> of all?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> answered <i>her</i>, The first of all the <i>butch lavs</i> is, <i>aunt nell</i>, O Israel; The <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i> is <i>una</i> <i>Duchess</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And thou shalt love the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> with all thy <i>thumping cheat</i>, and with all thy <i>nishta lucoddy</i>, and with all thy mind, and with all thy <i>butchness</i>: this is the first <i>butch lav</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy <i>homie ajax</i> as thyself. There is none other <i>butch lav</i> <i>dowrier</i> than these.
    </li>
    <li>And the scribe <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Well, Master, thou hast <i>cackled</i> the truth: for there is <i>una</i> <i>Gloria</i>; and there is none other but <i>she</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And to love <i>her</i> with all the <i>thumping cheat</i>, and with all the understanding, and with all the <i>nishta lucoddy</i>, and with all the <i>butchness</i>, and to love <i>her</i> <i>homie ajax</i> as himself, is more than all whole burnt <i>parkerings</i> and <i>parkers</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>Josie</i> <i>vardad</i> that <i>she</i> answered discreetly, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Thou art not <i>nishter ajax</i> the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>. And no <i>homie</i> after that durst ask <i>her</i> any question.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> answered and <i>cackled</i>, while <i>she</i> taught in the <i>holy carsey</i>, How <i>cackle</i> the <i>betty bracelets</i> that <i>Crystal</i> is the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>Davina</i>?
    </li>
    <li>For <i>Davina</i> himself <i>cackled</i> by the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>, The <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> to my <i>Duchess</i>, <i>lett</i> thou on my <i>sweet martini</i>, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.
    </li>
    <li><i>Davina</i> therefore himself <i>screecheth</i> <i>her</i> <i>Duchess</i>; and whence is <i>she</i> then <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>? And the common <i>homies and palones</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> <i>her</i> gladly.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them in <i>her</i> doctrine, <i>gardy loo</i> of the <i>betty bracelets</i>, which love to <i>troll</i> in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces,
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest</i> seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost <i>letties</i> at <i>dowry munjarlees</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Which devour widows&#8217; <i>latties</i>, and for a pretence make long <i>meshigener mutterings</i>: these shall <i>lall</i> <i>dowrier</i> damnation.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the <i>homies and palones</i> cast <i>dinarly</i> into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in <i>dowry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And there <i>trolled</i> a certain <i>nanti dinarly</i> widow, and she threw in <i>dewey</i> mites, which make a farthing.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>her</i> disciples, and <i>cackleth</i> unto them, Verily I <i>cackle</i> unto you, That this <i>nanti dinarly</i> widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:
    </li>
    <li>For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.
    </li>

    <h2>Chapter 13</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And as <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> out of the <i>holy carsey</i>, <i>una</i> of <i>her</i> disciples <i>cackleth</i> unto <i>her</i>, Master, <i>varda</i> what manner of stones and what buildings are here!
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> answering <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>vardest</i> thou these <i>dowry</i> buildings? there shall not be <i>dry</i> <i>una</i> stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.
    </li>
    <li>And as <i>she</i> sat upon the mount of Olives over against the <i>holy carsey</i>, <i>Petra</i> and James and <i>Jane</i> and <i>Andrea</i> asked <i>her</i> privately,
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackle</i> us, when shall these <i>fakements</i> be? and what shall be the sign when all these <i>fakements</i> shall be fulfilled?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> answering them began to <i>cackle</i>, <i>lell</i> heed lest any <i>homie</i> <i>mogue</i> you:
    </li>
    <li>For many shall <i>troll</i> in my name, <i>cackling</i>, I am <i>Crystal</i>; and shall <i>mogue</i> many.
    </li>
    <li>And when ye shall <i>aunt nell</i> of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for such <i>fakements</i> must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.
    </li>
    <li>For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be <i>nix munjarlees</i> and troubles: these are the beginnings of <i>shardas</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>lell</i> heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and <i>dowriest homies</i> for my sake, for a testimony against them.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>gossip</i> must first be published among all nations.
    </li>
    <li>But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, <i>lell</i> no thought beforehand what ye shall <i>cackle</i>, <i>nishta</i> do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be <i>parkered</i> you in that hour, that <i>cackle</i> ye: for it is not ye that <i>cackle</i>, but the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now the <i>sister</i> shall betray the <i>sister</i> to <i>carking it</i>, and the <i>Auntie</i> the <i>homie chavvie</i>; and <i>chavvies</i> shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to <i>carking it</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And ye shall be hated of all <i>homies</i> for my name&#8217;s sake: but <i>she</i> that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
    </li>
    <li>But when ye shall <i>varda</i> the <i>dowry cod</i> of desolation, <i>cackled</i> of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let <i>her</i> that <i>vardaeth the lavs</i> understand,) then let them that be in Judaea <i>scarper</i> to the mountains:
    </li>
    <li>And let <i>her</i> that is on the housetop not <i>troll</i> down into the <i>lattie</i>, <i>nishta</i> enter therein, to <i>lell</i> any <i>fakement</i> out of <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And let <i>her</i> that is in the field not turn back again for to <i>lell</i> up <i>her</i> <i>frock</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But woe to them that are <i>up the duff</i>, and to them that <i>parker</i> suck in those days!
    </li>
    <li>And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.
    </li>
    <li>For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which <i>Gloria</i> created unto this time, <i>nishta</i> shall be.
    </li>
    <li>And except that the <i>Duchess</i> had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect&#8217;s sake, whom <i>she</i> hath chosen, <i>she</i> hath shortened the days.
    </li>
    <li>And then if any <i>homie</i> shall <i>cackle</i> to you, Lo, here is <i>Crystal</i>; or, lo, <i>she</i> is there; believe <i>her</i> not:
    </li>
    <li>For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>lell</i> ye heed: <i>varda</i>, I have foretold you all <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be <i>munged</i>, and the moon shall not <i>parker</i> her <i>sparkle</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>twinkling fakements</i> of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.
    </li>
    <li>And then shall they <i>varda</i> the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> <i>trolling</i> in the clouds with <i>dowry</i> power and <i>fabeness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And then shall <i>she</i> <i>lau</i> <i>her</i> <i>fairies</i>, and shall gather together <i>her</i> elect from the <i>quarter</i> winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.
    </li>
    <li>Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and <i>laueth</i> forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:
    </li>
    <li>So ye in like manner, when ye shall <i>varda</i> these <i>fakements</i> <i>troll</i> to pass, know that it is <i>ajax</i>, even at the doors.
    </li>
    <li>Verily I <i>cackle</i> unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these <i>fakements</i> be done.
    </li>
    <li>Heaven and earth shall <i>troll away</i>: but my <i>lavs</i> shall not <i>troll away</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But of that <i>journo</i> and that hour knoweth no <i>homie</i>, no, not the <i>fairies</i> which are in heaven, <i>nishta</i> the <i>homie chavvie</i>, but the <i>Auntie</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Lell</i> ye heed, <i>varda</i> and pray: for ye know not when the time is.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> is as a <i>homie</i> taking a far journey, who <i>dry</i> <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>, and <i>parkered</i> authority to <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>, and to every <i>homie</i> <i>her</i> <i>acting dickey</i>, and commanded the porter to <i>varda</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i> ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the <i>lattie</i> <i>trolleth</i>, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning:
    </li>
    <li>Lest <i>trolling</i> suddenly <i>she</i> find you sleeping.
    </li>
    <li>And what I <i>cackle</i> unto you I <i>cackle</i> unto all, <i>varda</i>.

    <h2>Chapter 14</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>After <i>dewey</i> days was the <i>dowry munjarlee</i> of the <i>trollover</i>, and of unleavened <i>pannan</i>: and the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homies</i> and the <i>betty bracelets</i> sought how they might <i>lell</i> <i>her</i> by craft, and put <i>her</i> to <i>carking it</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But they <i>cackled</i>, Not on the <i>dowry munjarlee</i> <i>journo</i>, lest there be an uproar of the <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And being in Bethany in the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Simone</i> the leper, as <i>she</i> sat at <i>carnish</i>, there <i>trolled</i> a <i>palone</i> having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard <i>dowry</i> precious; and she brake the box, and poured it on <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and <i>cackled</i>, Why was this waste of the ointment made?
    </li>
    <li>For it might have been sold for more than <i>trey</i> <i>chenter</i> pence, and have been <i>parkered</i> to the <i>nanti dinarly</i>. And they murmured against her.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> <i>cackled</i>, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a <i>bona</i> <i>acting dickey</i> on me.
    </li>
    <li>For ye have the <i>nanti dinarly</i> with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them <i>bona</i>: but me ye have not always.
    </li>
    <li>She hath done what she could: she is <i>troll</i> aforehand to anoint my <i>lucoddy</i> to the burying.
    </li>
    <li>Verily I <i>cackle</i> unto you, Wheresoever this <i>gossip</i> shall be <i>cackled</i> throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be <i>cackled</i> of for a memorial of her.
    </li>
    <li>And Judas Iscariot, <i>una</i> of the <i>kenza</i>, <i>trolled</i> unto the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homies</i>, to betray <i>her</i> unto them.
    </li>
    <li>And when they <i>aunt nelled</i> it, they were glad, and promised to <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> <i>dinarly</i>. And <i>she</i> sought how <i>she</i> might conveniently betray <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the first <i>journo</i> of unleavened <i>pannan</i>, when they <i>ferricadozad</i> the <i>trollover</i>, <i>her</i> disciples <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Where wilt thou that we <i>troll</i> and prepare that thou mayest <i>jarry</i> the <i>trollover</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> sendeth forth <i>dewey</i> of <i>her</i> disciples, and <i>cackleth</i> unto them, <i>troll</i> ye into the <i>smoke</i>, and there shall meet you a <i>homie</i> bearing a pitcher of <i>aqua</i>: <i>troll after</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And wheresoever <i>she</i> shall <i>troll</i> in, <i>cackle</i> ye to the goodman of the <i>lattie</i>, The Master <i>cackleth</i>, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall <i>jarry</i> the <i>trollover</i> with my disciples?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> will shew you a large <i>dark room</i> furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>her</i> disciples <i>trolled</i> forth, and <i>trolled</i> into the <i>smoke</i>, and found as <i>she</i> had <i>cackled</i> unto them: and they made ready the <i>trollover</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And in the <i>bijou nochy</i> <i>she</i> <i>trolleth</i> with the <i>kenza</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And as they sat and did <i>jarry</i>, <i>Josie</i> <i>cackled</i>, Verily I <i>cackle</i> unto you, <i>una</i> of you which eateth with me shall betray me.
    </li>
    <li>And they began to be <i>shardaful</i>, and to <i>cackle</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>una</i> by <i>una</i>, Is it I? and another <i>cackled</i>, Is it I?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> answered and <i>cackled</i> unto them, It is <i>una</i> of the <i>kenza</i>, that dippeth with me in the dish.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> indeed goeth, as it is <i>screeved</i> of <i>her</i>: but woe to that <i>homie</i> by whom the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> is betrayed! <i>bona</i> were it for that <i>homie</i> if <i>she</i> had never been born.
    </li>
    <li>And as they did <i>jarry</i>, <i>Josie</i> <i>lelled</i> <i>pannan</i>, and <i>fabed</i>, and brake it, and <i>parkered</i> to them, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>lell</i>, <i>jarry</i>: this is my <i>lucoddy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> the cup, and when <i>she</i> had <i>parkered</i> thanks, <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> it to them: and they all drank of it.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.
    </li>
    <li>Verily I <i>cackle</i> unto you, I will <i>buvare</i> <i>nishta</i> of the fruit of the vine, until that <i>journo</i> that I <i>buvare</i> it new in the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when they had sung an hymn, they <i>trolled</i> out into the mount of Olives.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> <i>cackleth</i> unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this <i>nochy</i>: for it is <i>screeved</i>, I will <i>slap</i> the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.
    </li>
    <li>But after that I am risen, I will <i>troll</i> before you into Galilee.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>Petra</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> <i>cackleth</i> unto <i>her</i>, Verily I <i>cackle</i> unto thee, That this <i>journo</i>, even in this <i>nochy</i>, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> the more vehemently, If I should <i>cark it</i> with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also <i>cackled</i> they all.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>trolled</i> to a place which was named Gethsemane: and <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i> to <i>her</i> disciples, <i>lett</i> ye here, while I shall pray.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelleth</i> with <i>her</i> <i>Petra</i> and James and <i>Jane</i>, and began to be sore <i>gobsmacked</i>, and to be <i>dowry</i> heavy;
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackleth</i> unto them, My <i>nishta lucoddy</i> is exceeding <i>shardaful</i> unto <i>carking it</i>: tarry ye here, and <i>varda</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> forward a <i>bijou</i>, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Abba, <i>Auntie</i>, all <i>fakements</i> are possible unto thee; <i>lell</i> away this cup from me: <i>any road up</i> not what I will, but what thou wilt.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolleth</i>, and findeth them sleeping, and <i>cackleth</i> unto <i>Petra</i>, <i>Simone</i>, sleepest thou? couldest not thou <i>varda</i> <i>una</i> hour?
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i> ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The <i>Fairy</i> truly is ready, but the flesh is <i>nelly</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And again <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> away, and prayed, and <i>cackled</i> the same <i>lavs</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> <i>trolled back</i>, <i>she</i> found them asleep again, (for their <i>ogles</i> were heavy,) <i>nishta</i> wist they what to answer <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolleth</i> the third time, and <i>cackleth</i> unto them, <i>letty</i> on now, and <i>lell</i> your <i>lettie</i>: it is enough, the hour is <i>troll</i>; <i>varda</i>, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> is betrayed into the <i>fambles</i> of <i>kerterverers</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Rise up, let us <i>troll</i>; lo, <i>she</i> that betrayeth me is at <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And immediately, while <i>she</i> yet <i>cackled</i>, <i>trolleth</i> Judas, <i>una</i> of the <i>kenza</i>, and with <i>her</i> a <i>dowry</i> multitude with <i>dowry efinks</i> and staves, from the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homies</i> and the <i>betty bracelets</i> and the <i>fungi</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> that betrayed <i>her</i> had <i>parkered</i> them a token, <i>cackling</i>, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is <i>she</i>; <i>lell</i> <i>her</i>, and lead <i>her</i> away safely.
    </li>
    <li>And as soon as <i>she</i> was <i>troll</i>, <i>she</i> goeth straightway to <i>her</i>, and <i>cackleth</i>, Master, master; and kissed <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>laued</i> their <i>fambles</i> on <i>her</i>, and <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>una</i> of them that stood by drew a <i>dowry efink</i>, and <i>slapped</i> a <i>serving homie</i> of the high <i>godly homie</i>, and cut off <i>her</i> <i>aunt nelling cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> answered and <i>cackled</i> unto them, Are ye <i>troll</i> out, as against a <i>sharpering homie</i>, with <i>dowry efinks</i> and with staves to <i>lell</i> me?
    </li>
    <li>I was daily with you in the <i>holy carsey</i> teaching, and ye <i>lelled</i> me not: but the <i>glossies</i> must be fulfilled.
    </li>
    <li>And they all forsook <i>her</i>, and fled.
    </li>
    <li>And there <i>trolled after</i> <i>her</i> a certain <i>bean cove</i>, having a <i>lycra</i> cloth cast about <i>her</i> <i>nanti zhoosh</i> <i>lucoddy</i>; and the <i>bean coves</i> <i>laued</i> hold on <i>her</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>dry</i> the <i>lycra</i> cloth, and fled from them <i>nanti zhoosh</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they led <i>Josie</i> away to the high <i>godly homie</i>: and with <i>her</i> were assembled all the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homies</i> and the <i>fungi</i> and the <i>betty bracelets</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Petra</i> <i>trolled after</i> <i>her</i> <i>nishta ajax</i> off, even into the <i>dowry lattie</i> of the high <i>godly homie</i>: and <i>she</i> sat with the <i>serving homies</i>, and warmed himself at the <i>binco fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homies</i> and all the council sought for <i>varda-ing fakement</i> against <i>Josie</i> to put <i>her</i> to <i>carking it</i>; and found none.
    </li>
    <li>For many bare false <i>varda-ing fakement</i> against <i>her</i>, but their <i>varda-ing fakement</i> agreed not together.
    </li>
    <li>And there arose certain, and bare false <i>varda-ing fakement</i> against <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>We <i>aunt nelled</i> <i>her</i> <i>cackle</i>, I will <i>battyfang</i> this <i>holy carsey</i> that is made with <i>fambles</i>, and within <i>trey</i> days I will build another made <i>nanti</i> <i>fambles</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>nishta</i> so did their <i>varda-ing fakement</i> agree together.
    </li>
    <li>And the high <i>godly homie</i> stood up in the midst, and asked <i>Josie</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Answerest thou <i>nishter</i>? what is it which these <i>varda-ing fakement</i> against thee?
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> held <i>her</i> peace, and answered <i>nishter</i>. Again the high <i>godly homie</i> asked <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Art thou the <i>Crystal</i>, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of the <i>fabed</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> <i>cackled</i>, I am: and ye shall <i>varda</i> the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> sitting on the <i>sweet martini</i> of power, and <i>trolling</i> in the clouds of heaven.
    </li>
    <li>Then the high <i>godly homie</i> rent <i>her</i> <i>zhoosh</i>, and <i>cackleth</i>, What need we any further witnesses?
    </li>
    <li>Ye have <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>billingsgate</i>: what think ye? And they all condemned <i>her</i> to be guilty of <i>carking it</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And some began to spit on <i>her</i>, and to cover <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>, and to buffet <i>her</i>, and to <i>cackle</i> unto <i>her</i>, Prophesy: and the <i>serving homies</i> did strike <i>her</i> with the palms of their <i>fambles</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And as <i>Petra</i> was beneath in the <i>dowry lattie</i>, there <i>trolleth</i> <i>una</i> of the maids of the high <i>godly homie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And when she <i>vardad</i> <i>Petra</i> warming himself, she looked upon <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, And thou also wast with <i>Josie</i> of Nazareth.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> denied, <i>cackling</i>, I know not, <i>nishta</i> understand I what thou <i>cackleth</i>. And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> out into the porch; and the cock crew.
    </li>
    <li>And a maid <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i> again, and began to <i>cackle</i> to them that stood by, This is <i>una</i> of them.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> denied it again. And a <i>bijou</i> after, they that stood by <i>cackled</i> again to <i>Petra</i>, Surely thou art <i>una</i> of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy <i>cackle</i> agreeth thereto.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> began to curse and to swear, <i>cackling</i>, I know not this <i>homie</i> of whom ye <i>cackle</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the second time the cock crew. And <i>Petra</i> <i>screeched</i> to mind the <i>lav</i> that <i>Josie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when <i>she</i> thought thereon, <i>she</i> <i>parnied</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 15</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And straightway in the morning the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homies</i> held a consultation with the <i>fungi</i> and <i>betty bracelets</i> and the whole council, and bound <i>Josie</i>, and <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> away, and <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> to Pilate.
    </li>
    <li>And Pilate asked <i>her</i>, Art thou the <i>dowriest homie</i> of the <i>kosher homies</i>? And <i>she</i> answering <i>cackled</i> unto them, Thou <i>cackleth</i> it.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homies</i> accused <i>her</i> of many <i>fakements</i>: but <i>she</i> answered <i>nishter</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Pilate asked <i>her</i> again, <i>cackling</i>, Answerest thou <i>nishter</i>? <i>varda</i> how many <i>fakements</i> they <i>varda-ing fakement</i> against thee.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>Josie</i> yet answered <i>nishter</i>; so that Pilate marvelled.
    </li>
    <li>Now at that <i>dowry munjarlee</i> <i>she</i> released unto them <i>una</i> prisoner, whomsoever they <i>fancied</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And there was <i>una</i> named Barabbas, which <i>lett</i> bound with them that had made insurrection with <i>her</i>, who had committed murder in the insurrection.
    </li>
    <li>And the multitude <i>screeching</i> aloud began to <i>fancy</i> <i>her</i> to do as <i>she</i> had ever done unto them.
    </li>
    <li>But Pilate answered them, <i>cackling</i>, Will ye that I release unto you the <i>dowriest homie</i> of the <i>kosher homies</i>?
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> knew that the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homies</i> had <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> for envy.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homies</i> <i>trolled</i> the <i>homies and palones</i>, that <i>she</i> should rather release Barabbas unto them.
    </li>
    <li>And Pilate answered and <i>cackled</i> again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto <i>her</i> whom ye <i>screech</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> of the <i>kosher homies</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>screeched</i> out again, Crucify <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then Pilate <i>cackled</i> unto them, Why, what <i>nana</i> hath <i>she</i> done? And they <i>screeched</i> out the more exceedingly, Crucify <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And so Pilate, willing to content the <i>homies and palones</i>, released Barabbas unto them, and <i>laued</i> <i>Josie</i>, when <i>she</i> had scourged <i>her</i>, to be crucified.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>butch homies</i> led <i>her</i> away into the hall, <i>screeched</i> Praetorium; and they <i>screech</i> together the whole band.
    </li>
    <li>And they clothed <i>her</i> with purple, and platted a <i>mudge</i> of thorns, and put it about <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And began to salute <i>her</i>, Hail, <i>dowriest homie</i> of the <i>kosher homies</i>!
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>slapped</i> <i>her</i> on the <i>eke</i> with a reed, and did spit upon <i>her</i>, and bowing their knees worshipped <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when they had mocked <i>her</i>, they <i>lelled</i> off the purple from <i>her</i>, and put <i>her</i> own <i>zhoosh</i> on <i>her</i>, and led <i>her</i> out to crucify <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they compel <i>una</i> <i>Simone</i> a Cyrenian, who <i>trolled by</i>, <i>trolling</i> out of the country, the <i>Auntie</i> of Alexander and Rufus, to bear <i>her</i> cross.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> to <i>buvare</i> <i>sherry</i> mingled with myrrh: but <i>she</i> <i>lalled</i> it not.
    </li>
    <li>And when they had crucified <i>her</i>, they parted <i>her</i> <i>frocks</i>, <i>chucking</i> lots upon them, what every <i>homie</i> should <i>lell</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And it was the third hour, and they crucified <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the superscription of <i>her</i> accusation was <i>screeved</i> over, THE <i>dowriest homie</i> OF THE <i>kosher homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And with <i>her</i> they crucify <i>dewey</i> <i>sharpering homies</i>; the <i>una</i> on <i>her</i> <i>sweet martini</i>, and the other on <i>her</i> <i>dry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>glossy</i> was fulfilled, which <i>cackleth</i>, And <i>she</i> was numbered with the transgressors.
    </li>
    <li>And they that <i>trolled by</i> railed on <i>her</i>, wagging their <i>ekes</i>, and <i>cackling</i>, Ah, thou that destroyest the <i>holy carsey</i>, and buildest it in <i>trey</i> days,
    </li>
    <li>Save thyself, and <i>troll</i> down from the cross.
    </li>
    <li>Likewise also the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homies</i> mocking <i>cackled</i> among themselves with the <i>betty bracelets</i>, <i>she</i> saved others; himself <i>she</i> cannot save.
    </li>
    <li>Let <i>Crystal</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel <i>troll down</i> now from the cross, that we may <i>varda</i> and believe. And they that were crucified with <i>her</i> reviled <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>seyth</i> hour was <i>troll</i>, there was <i>munge</i> over the whole land until the ninth hour.
    </li>
    <li>And at the ninth hour <i>Josie</i> <i>screeched</i> with a loud <i>cackling fakement</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My <i>Gloria</i>, my <i>Gloria</i>, why hast thou forsaken me?
    </li>
    <li>And some of them that stood by, when they <i>aunt nelled</i> it, <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, <i>she</i> <i>screecheth</i> Elias.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>una</i> ran and filled a spunge full of <i>alcopop</i>, and put it on a reed, and <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> to <i>buvare</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Let alone; let us <i>varda</i> whether Elias will <i>troll</i> to <i>lell</i> <i>her</i> down.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> <i>screeched</i> with a loud <i>cackling fakement</i>, and <i>parkered</i> up the <i>fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the veil of the <i>holy carsey</i> was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.
    </li>
    <li>And when the centurion, which stood over against <i>her</i>, <i>vardad</i> that <i>she</i> so <i>screeched</i> out, and <i>parkered</i> up the <i>fairy</i>, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Truly this <i>homie</i> was the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>There were also <i>palones</i> looking on <i>nishta ajax</i> off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the <i>nanti dowry</i> and of Joses, and Salome;
    </li>
    <li>(Who also, when <i>she</i> was in Galilee, <i>trolled after</i> <i>her</i>, and ministered unto <i>her</i>😉 and many other <i>palones</i> which <i>trolled</i> up with <i>her</i> unto Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And now when the even was <i>troll</i>, because it was the preparation, that is, the <i>journo</i> before the sabbath,
    </li>
    <li><i>Josephine</i> of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>, <i>trolled</i>, and <i>trolled</i> in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the <i>lucoddy</i> of <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Pilate marvelled if <i>she</i> were already <i>stiff</i>: and calling unto <i>her</i> the centurion, <i>she</i> asked <i>her</i> whether <i>she</i> had been any while <i>stiff</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> knew it of the centurion, <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> the <i>lucoddy</i> to <i>Josephine</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> bought <i>bona</i> <i>lycra</i>, and <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> down, and wrapped <i>her</i> in the <i>lycra</i>, and <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.
    </li>
    <li>And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where <i>she</i> was <i>laued</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 16</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought <i>bona</i> spices, that they might <i>troll</i> and anoint <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>dowry</i> early in the morning the first <i>journo</i> of the week, they <i>trolled</i> unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>cackled</i> among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?
    </li>
    <li>And when they looked, they <i>vardad</i> that the stone was rolled away: for it was <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And entering into the sepulchre, they <i>vardad</i> a <i>bean cove</i> sitting on the <i>sweet</i> side, clothed in a long white <i>frock</i>; and they were affrighted.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i> unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye <i>charper</i> <i>Josie</i> of Nazareth, which was crucified: <i>she</i> is risen; <i>she</i> is not here: <i>varda</i> the place where they <i>laued</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>troll</i> your way, <i>cackle</i> <i>her</i> disciples and <i>Petra</i> that <i>she</i> goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye <i>varda</i> <i>her</i>, as <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto you.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>trolled</i> out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were <i>gobsmacked</i>: <i>nishta</i> <i>cackled</i> they any <i>fakement</i> to any <i>homie</i>; for they were afraid.
    </li>
    <li>Now when <i>Josie</i> was risen early the first <i>journo</i> of the week, <i>she</i> appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom <i>she</i> had cast <i>setter</i> devils.
    </li>
    <li>And she <i>trolled</i> and <i>cackled</i> them that had been with <i>her</i>, as they mourned and <i>parnied</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they, when they had <i>aunt nelled</i> that <i>she</i> was alive, and had been <i>vardad</i> of her, believed not.
    </li>
    <li>After that <i>she</i> appeared in another form unto <i>dewey</i> of them, as they <i>minced</i>, and <i>trolled</i> into the country.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>trolled</i> and <i>cackled</i> it unto the residue: <i>nishta</i> believed they them.
    </li>
    <li>Afterward <i>she</i> appeared unto the <i>long dedger</i> as they sat at <i>carnish</i>, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of <i>thumping cheat</i>, because they believed not them which had <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i> after <i>she</i> was risen.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>troll</i> ye into all the world, and <i>cackle</i> the <i>gossip</i> to every creature.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but <i>she</i> that believeth not shall be damned.
    </li>
    <li>And these signs shall <i>troll after</i> them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall <i>cackle</i> with new <i>polaris</i>;
    </li>
    <li>They shall <i>lell</i> up serpents; and if they <i>buvare</i> any deadly <i>fakement</i>, it shall not hurt them; they shall <i>lett</i> <i>fambles</i> on the sick, and they shall recover.
    </li>
    <li>So then after the <i>Duchess</i> had <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>she</i> was <i>lalled</i> up into heaven, and sat on the <i>sweet martini</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>trolled</i> forth, and <i>cackled</i> every where, the <i>Duchess</i> working with them, and confirming the <i>lav</i> with signs following. <i>Larlou</i>.
