    <li><i>Any road up</i> on the morrow, when the <i>naffs</i> <i>trolled</i> to strip the <i>ferricadoozed</i>, that they found Saul and <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> fallen in mount Gilboa.
    </li>
    <li>And when they had stripped <i>her</i>, they <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>, and <i>her</i> armour, and <i>laued</i> into the land of the <i>naffs</i> round about, to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they put <i>her</i> armour in the <i>lattie</i> of their gods, and fastened <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> in the <i>holy carsey</i> of Dagon.
    </li>
    <li>And when all Jabeshgilead <i>aunt nelled</i> all that the <i>naffs</i> had done to Saul,
    </li>
    <li>They arose, all the valiant <i>homies</i>, and <i>lelled</i> away the <i>lucoddy</i> of Saul, and the bodies of <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted <i>setter</i> days.
    </li>
    <li>So Saul <i>carked it</i> for <i>her</i> transgression which <i>she</i> committed against the <i>Duchess</i>, even against the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, which <i>she</i> kept not, and also for asking counsel of <i>una</i> that had a familiar <i>Fairy</i>, to enquire of it;
    </li>
    <li>And enquired not of the <i>Duchess</i>: therefore <i>she</i> <i>ferricadoozaed</i> <i>her</i>, and turned the kingdom unto <i>Davina</i> the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jesse.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Then all Israel gathered themselves to <i>Davina</i> unto Hebron, <i>cackling</i>, <i>varda</i>, we are thy bone and thy flesh.
    </li>
    <li>And moreover in time past, even when Saul was <i>dowriest homie</i>, thou wast <i>she</i> that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i> unto thee, Thou shalt feed my <i>homies and palones</i> Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my <i>homies and palones</i> Israel.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore <i>trolled</i> all the <i>fungi</i> of Israel to the <i>dowriest homie</i> to Hebron; and <i>Davina</i> made a covenant with them in Hebron before the <i>Duchess</i>; and they anointed <i>Davina</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> over Israel, according to the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> by Samuel.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> and all Israel <i>trolled</i> to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.
    </li>
    <li>And the inhabitants of Jebus <i>cackled</i> to <i>Davina</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>troll</i> hither. <i>Any road up</i> <i>Davina</i> <i>lelled</i> the <i>butch lattie</i> of Zion, which is the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> <i>cackled</i>, Whosoever <i>slappeth</i> the Jebusites first shall be <i>dowriest</i> and captain. So Joab the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Zeruiah <i>trolled</i> first up, and was <i>dowriest</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> <i>letted</i> in the <i>butch lattie</i>; therefore they <i>screeched</i> it the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> built the <i>smoke</i> round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the <i>lettie</i> of the <i>smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So <i>Davina</i> waxed <i>dowrier</i> and <i>dowrier</i>: for the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts was with <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>These also are the <i>dowriest</i> of the <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i> whom <i>Davina</i> had, who strengthened themselves with <i>her</i> in <i>her</i> kingdom, and with all Israel, to make <i>her</i> <i>dowriest homie</i>, according to the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> concerning Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And this is the number of the <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i> whom <i>Davina</i> had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the <i>dowriest</i> of the captains: <i>she</i> lifted up <i>her</i> spear against <i>trey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>ferricadoozed</i> by <i>her</i> at <i>una</i> time.
    </li>
    <li>And after <i>her</i> was Eleazar the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was <i>una</i> of the <i>trey</i> mighties.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> was with <i>Davina</i> at Pasdammim, and there the <i>naffs</i> were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the <i>homies and palones</i> fled from before the <i>naffs</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and <i>laued</i> it, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> the <i>naffs</i>; and the <i>Duchess</i> saved them by a <i>dowry</i> deliverance.
    </li>
    <li>Now <i>trey</i> of the <i>trey dacha</i> captains <i>trolled</i> down to the rock to <i>Davina</i>, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the <i>naffs</i> encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> was then in the hold, and the <i>naffs</i>&#8216; garrison was then at Bethlehem.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> longed, and <i>cackled</i>, Oh that <i>una</i> would <i>parker</i> me <i>buvare</i> of the <i>aqua</i> of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate!
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>trey</i> brake through the host of the <i>naffs</i>, and drew <i>aqua</i> out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and <i>lelled</i> it, and brought it to <i>Davina</i>: but <i>Davina</i> would not <i>buvare</i> of it, but poured it out to the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackled</i>, My <i>Gloria</i> forbid it me, that I should do this <i>fakement</i>: shall I <i>buvare</i> the blood of these <i>homies</i> that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it. Therefore <i>she</i> would not <i>buvare</i> it. These <i>fakements</i> did these <i>trey</i> mightiest.
    </li>
    <li>And Abishai the <i>sister</i> of Joab, <i>she</i> was <i>dowriest</i> of the <i>trey</i>: for lifting up <i>her</i> spear against <i>trey</i> <i>chenter</i>, <i>she</i> <i>ferricadoozaed</i> them, and had a name among the <i>trey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Of the <i>trey</i>, <i>she</i> was more honourable than the <i>dewey</i>; for <i>she</i> was their captain: howbeit <i>she</i> attained not to the first <i>trey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Benaiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jehoiada, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of a valiant <i>homie</i> of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; <i>she</i> <i>ferricadoozaed</i> <i>dewey</i> lionlike <i>homies</i> of Moab: also <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> down and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> a lion in a pit in a snowy <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>ferricadoozaed</i> an Egyptian, a <i>homie</i> of <i>dowry</i> stature, <i>chinker</i> cubits high; and in the Egyptian&#8217;s <i>famble</i> was a spear like a weaver&#8217;s beam; and <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> down to <i>her</i> with a <i>trolling fakement</i>, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian&#8217;s <i>famble</i>, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> <i>her</i> with <i>her</i> own spear.
    </li>
    <li>These <i>fakements</i> did Benaiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jehoiada, and had the name among the <i>trey</i> mighties.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, <i>she</i> was honourable among the <i>trey dacha</i>, but attained not to the first <i>trey</i>: and <i>Davina</i> set <i>her</i> over <i>her</i> <i>charpering homie</i>.

    <li>They were armed with bows, and could use both the <i>sweet martini</i> and the <i>dry</i> in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow, even of Saul&#8217;s <i>sisters</i> of Benjamin.

    <li>The <i>dowriest</i> was Ahiezer, then Joash, the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Shemaah the Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Azmaveth; and Berachah, and Jehu the Antothite.

    <li>And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto <i>Davina</i> into the hold to the <i>nishta smoke</i> <i>homies</i> of might, and <i>homies</i> of <i>barney</i> fit for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose <i>ekes</i> were like the <i>ekes</i> of lions, and were as swift as the roes upon the mountains;

    <li>Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,

    <li>These were of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Gad, captains of the host: <i>una</i> of the <i>nanti dowriest</i> was over an <i>chenter</i>, and the <i>dowriest</i> over a <i>mille</i>.
    </li>
    <li>These are they that <i>trolled</i> over Jordan in the first month, when it had overflown all <i>her</i> banks; and they put to flight all them of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the west.
    </li>
    <li>And there <i>trolled</i> of the <i>chavvies</i> of Benjamin and Judah to the hold unto <i>Davina</i>.

    <li>And <i>Davina</i> <i>trolled</i> out to meet them, and answered and <i>cackled</i> unto them, If ye be <i>troll</i> peaceably unto me to help me, mine <i>thumping cheat</i> shall be knit unto you: but if ye be <i>troll</i> to betray me to mine enemies, <i>vardaing</i> there is no wrong in mine <i>fambles</i>, the <i>Gloria</i> of our <i>aunties</i> <i>varda</i> thereon, and rebuke it.

    <li>Then the <i>Fairy</i> <i>trolled</i> upon Amasai, who was <i>dowriest</i> of the captains, and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Thine are we, <i>Davina</i>, and on thy side, thou <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jesse: peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to thine helpers; for thy <i>Gloria</i> helpeth thee.

    </li>
    <li>And there fell some of Manasseh to <i>Davina</i>, when <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> with the <i>naffs</i> against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the <i>ladies</i> of the <i>naffs</i> upon advisement <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> away, <i>cackling</i>, <i>she</i> will fall to <i>her</i> master Saul to the jeopardy of our <i>ekes</i>.

    </li>
    <li>And they helped <i>Davina</i> against the band of the rovers: for they were all <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i> of valour, and were captains in the host.

    <li>For at that time <i>journo</i> by <i>journo</i> there <i>trolled</i> to <i>Davina</i> to help <i>her</i>, until it was a <i>dowry</i> host, like the host of <i>Gloria</i>.

    <li>And of the <i>chavvies</i> of Issachar, which were <i>homies</i> that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the <i>ekes</i> of them were <i>dewey</i> <i>chenter</i>; and all their <i>sisters</i> were at their <i>butch lav</i>.

    <li>All these <i>homies</i> of <i>barney</i>, that could keep rank, <i>trolled</i> with a <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> to Hebron, to make <i>Davina</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> over all Israel: and all the <i>lettie</i> also of Israel were of <i>una</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> to make <i>Davina</i> <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And there they were with <i>Davina</i> <i>trey</i> days, eating and <i>bevvying</i>: for their <i>sisters</i> had prepared for them.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover they that were <i>ajax</i> them, even unto Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought <i>pannan</i> on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, and <i>carnish</i>, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and <i>sherry</i>, and <i>lube</i>, and oxen, and sheep <i>dowrily</i>: for there was joy in Israel.

    <h2>Chapter 13</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> consulted with the captains of <i>milles</i> and <i>chenters</i>, and with every leader.

    <li>And <i>Davina</i> <i>cackled</i> unto all the <i>punters</i> of Israel, If it seem <i>bona</i> unto you, and that it be of the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i>, let us <i>lau</i> abroad unto our <i>sisters</i> every where, that are <i>dry</i> in all the land of Israel, and with them also to the <i>godly homies</i> and Levites which are in their <i>smokes</i> and suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us:
    </li>
    <li>And let us <i>parker</i> again the <i>bijou arkette</i> of our <i>Gloria</i> to us: for we enquired not at it in the days of Saul.
    </li>
    <li>And all the <i>punters</i> <i>cackled</i> that they would do so: for the <i>fakement</i> was <i>sweet</i> in the <i>ogles</i> of all the <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So <i>Davina</i> gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to <i>parker</i> the <i>bijou arkette</i> of <i>Gloria</i> from Kirjathjearim.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> <i>trolled</i> up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kirjathjearim, which belonged to Judah, to <i>parker</i> up thence the <i>bijou arkette</i> of <i>Gloria</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, that <i>letteth</i> between the cherubims, whose name is <i>screeched</i> on it.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>lelled</i> the <i>bijou arkette</i> of <i>Gloria</i> in a new cart out of the <i>lattie</i> of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> and all Israel played before <i>Gloria</i> with all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.
    </li>
    <li>And when they <i>trolled</i> unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> to hold the <i>bijou arkette</i>; for the oxen stumbled.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>wild</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> was kindled against Uzza, and <i>she</i> <i>slapped</i> <i>her</i>, because <i>she</i> put <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> to the <i>bijou arkette</i>: and there <i>she</i> <i>carked it</i> before <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> was displeased, because the <i>Duchess</i> had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is <i>screeched</i> Perezuzza to this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> was afraid of <i>Gloria</i> that <i>journo</i>, <i>cackling</i>, How shall I <i>parker</i> the <i>bijou arkette</i> of <i>Gloria</i> home to me?
    </li>
    <li>So <i>Davina</i> brought not the <i>bijou arkette</i> home to himself to the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i>, but <i>lelled</i> it aside into the <i>lattie</i> of Obededom the Gittite.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>bijou arkette</i> of <i>Gloria</i> remained with the family of Obededom in <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i> <i>trey</i> months. And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>fabed</i> the <i>lattie</i> of Obededom, and all that <i>she</i> had.

    <li>And <i>Davina</i> perceived that the <i>Duchess</i> had confirmed <i>her</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> over Israel, for <i>her</i> kingdom was lifted up on high, because of <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i> Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> <i>lelled</i> more <i>palone affairs</i> at Jerusalem: and <i>Davina</i> <i>chavvied</i> more <i>homie chavvies</i> and <i>palone chavvies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now these are the names of <i>her</i> <i>chavvies</i> which <i>she</i> had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,

    <li>And the <i>naffs</i> <i>trolled</i> and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.

    <li>And <i>Davina</i> enquired of <i>Gloria</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Shall I <i>troll</i> up against the <i>naffs</i>? And wilt thou deliver them into mine <i>famble</i>? And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>troll</i> up; for I will deliver them into thine <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So they <i>trolled</i> up to Baalperazim; and <i>Davina</i> <i>slapped</i> them there. Then <i>Davina</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>Gloria</i> hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine <i>famble</i> like the breaking forth of <i>aquas</i>: therefore they <i>screeched</i> the name of that place Baalperazim.
    </li>
    <li>And when they had <i>dry</i> their gods there, <i>Davina</i> <i>parkered</i> a <i>butch lav</i>, and they were burned with <i>binco fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>naffs</i> yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore <i>Davina</i> enquired again of <i>Gloria</i>; and <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>troll not</i> up after them; turn away from them, and <i>troll</i> upon them over against the mulberry trees.
    </li>
    <li>And it shall be, when thou shalt <i>aunt nell</i> a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt <i>troll out</i> to battle: for <i>Gloria</i> is <i>trolled</i> forth before thee to <i>slap</i> the host of the <i>naffs</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Davina</i> therefore did as <i>Gloria</i> commanded <i>her</i>: and they <i>slapped</i> the host of the <i>naffs</i> from Gibeon even to Gazer.
    </li>
    <li>And the fame of <i>Davina</i> <i>trolled</i> out into all lands; and the <i>Duchess</i> brought the fear of <i>her</i> upon all nations.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 15</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> made <i>her</i> <i>latties</i> in the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i>, and prepared a place for the <i>bijou arkette</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and pitched for it a <i>trolling lettie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>Davina</i> <i>cackled</i>, None ought to carry the <i>bijou arkette</i> of <i>Gloria</i> but the Levites: for them hath the <i>Duchess</i> chosen to carry the <i>bijou arkette</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and to minister unto <i>her</i> for ever.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to <i>parker</i> up the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> unto <i>her</i> place, which <i>she</i> had prepared for it.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> assembled the <i>chavvies</i> of Aaron, and the Levites:
    </li>
    <li>Of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Kohath; Uriel the <i>dowriest</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i> an <i>chenter</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Merari; Asaiah the <i>dowriest</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i> <i>dewey</i> <i>chenter</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Gershom; Joel the <i>dowriest</i> and <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i> an <i>chenter</i> and <i>trey dacha</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the <i>dowriest</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i> <i>dewey</i> <i>chenter</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Hebron; Eliel the <i>dowriest</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i> fourscore:
    </li>
    <li>Of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Uzziel; Amminadab the <i>dowriest</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i> an <i>chenter</i> and <i>kenza</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> <i>screeched</i> for Zadok and Abiathar the <i>godly homies</i>, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackled</i> unto them, Ye are the <i>dowriest</i> of the <i>aunties</i> of the Levites: <i>bonafy</i> yourselves, both ye and your <i>sisters</i>, that ye may <i>parker</i> up the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel unto the place that I have prepared for it.
    </li>
    <li>For because ye did it not at the first, the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i> made a breach upon us, for that we sought <i>her</i> not after the due order.
    </li>
    <li>So the <i>godly homies</i> and the Levites sanctified themselves to <i>parker</i> up the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of the Levites bare the <i>bijou arkette</i> of <i>Gloria</i> upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as <i>Maureen</i> commanded according to the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> <i>cackled</i> to the <i>dowriest</i> of the Levites to appoint their <i>sisters</i> to be the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the <i>cackling fakement</i> with joy.
    </li>
    <li>So the Levites appointed Heman the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Joel; and of <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, Asaph the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Berechiah; and of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Merari their <i>sisters</i>, Ethan the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Kushaiah;
    </li>
    <li>And with them their <i>sisters</i> of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters.
    </li>
    <li>So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound with cymbals of brass;
    </li>
    <li>And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth;
    </li>
    <li>And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.
    </li>
    <li>And Chenaniah, <i>dowriest</i> of the Levites, was for <i>chant</i>: <i>she</i> instructed about the <i>chant</i>, because <i>she</i> was skilful.
    </li>
    <li>And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the <i>bijou arkette</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the <i>godly homies</i>, did blow with the trumpets before the <i>bijou arkette</i> of <i>Gloria</i>: and Obededom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the <i>bijou arkette</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So <i>Davina</i>, and the <i>fungi</i> of Israel, and the captains over <i>milles</i>, <i>trolled</i> to <i>parker</i> up the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the covenant of the <i>Duchess</i> out of the <i>lattie</i> of Obededom with joy.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when <i>Gloria</i> helped the Levites that bare the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the covenant of the <i>Duchess</i>, that they offered <i>setter</i> bullocks and <i>setter</i> rams.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> was clothed with a <i>frock</i> of <i>bona</i> <i>lycra</i>, and all the Levites that bare the <i>bijou arkette</i>, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the <i>chant</i> with the singers: <i>Davina</i> also had upon <i>her</i> an ephod of <i>lycra</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thus all Israel brought up the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the covenant of the <i>Duchess</i> with <i>screeching</i>, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a <i>screech</i> with psalteries and harps.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, as the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the covenant of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> to the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i>, that Michal, the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Saul looking out at a window <i>vardad</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>Davina</i> <i>walloping</i> and playing: and she despised <i>her</i> in her <i>thumping cheat</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 16</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>So they brought the <i>bijou arkette</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and set it in the midst of the <i>trolling lettie</i> that <i>Davina</i> had pitched for it: and they offered burnt <i>parkers</i> and peace <i>parkerings</i> before <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>Davina</i> had made an end of <i>parkering</i> the burnt <i>parkerings</i> and the peace <i>parkerings</i>, <i>she</i> <i>fabed</i> the <i>homies and palones</i> in the name of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> dealt to every <i>una</i> of Israel, both <i>homie</i> and <i>palone</i>, to every <i>una</i> a loaf of <i>pannan</i>, and a <i>bona</i> piece of flesh, and a flagon of <i>sherry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and to record, and to thank and praise the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel:
    </li>
    <li>Asaph the <i>dowriest</i>, and next to <i>her</i> Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;
    </li>
    <li>Benaiah also and Jahaziel the <i>godly homies</i> with trumpets continually before the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the covenant of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then on that <i>journo</i> <i>Davina</i> <i>laued</i> first this psalm to thank the <i>Duchess</i> into the <i>famble</i> of Asaph and <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Parker</i> thanks unto the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>screech</i> upon <i>her</i> name, make known <i>her</i> deeds among the <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Sing unto <i>her</i>, sing psalms unto <i>her</i>, talk ye of all <i>her</i> <i>fabulosa</i> works.
    </li>
    <li><i>Fabeness</i> ye in <i>her</i> <i>fabulosa</i> name: let the <i>thumping cheat</i> of them rejoice that <i>charper</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Charper</i> the <i>Duchess</i> and <i>her</i> <i>butchness</i>, <i>charper</i> <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> continually.
    </li>
    <li>Remember <i>her</i> marvellous works that <i>she</i> hath done, <i>her</i> wonders, and the judgments of <i>her</i> <i>screech</i>;
    </li>
    <li>O ye <i>maria</i> of Israel <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i>, ye <i>chavvies</i> of Jacob, <i>her</i> chosen ones.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> is the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i>; <i>her</i> judgments are in all the earth.
    </li>
    <li>Be ye mindful always of <i>her</i> covenant; the <i>lav</i> which <i>she</i> commanded to a <i>mille</i> <i>chavvies</i>;

    <li>Even of the covenant which <i>she</i> made with Abraham, and of <i>her</i> oath unto Isaac;

    <li>And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant,

    <li><i>Cackling</i>, Unto thee will I <i>parker</i> the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;

    <li>When ye were but <i>nishta dowry</i>, even a <i>nishta dowry</i>, and strangers in it.
    </li>
    <li>And when they <i>trolled</i> from nation to nation, and from <i>una</i> kingdom to another <i>homies and palones</i>;

    <li><i>She</i> suffered no <i>homie</i> to do them wrong: <i>any road up</i>, <i>she</i> reproved <i>dowriest homies</i> for their sakes,

    <li>Sing unto the <i>Duchess</i>, all the earth; shew forth from <i>journo</i> to <i>journo</i> <i>her</i> salvation.

    <li>For all the gods of the <i>homies and palones</i> are idols: but the <i>Duchess</i> made the heavens.

    <li><i>Fabed</i> be the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel for ever and ever. And all the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>Larlou</i>, and praised the <i>Duchess</i>.

    <li>So <i>she</i> <i>dry</i> there before the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the covenant of the <i>Duchess</i> Asaph and <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, to minister before the <i>bijou arkette</i> continually, as every <i>journo</i>&#8216;s <i>acting dickey</i> required:

    <li>To offer burnt <i>parkerings</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i> upon the <i>grovelling fakement</i> of the burnt <i>parkering</i> continually morning and <i>bijou nochy</i>, and to do according to all that is <i>screeved</i> in the law of the <i>Duchess</i>, which <i>she</i> commanded Israel;

    <h2>Chapter 17</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now it <i>trolled</i> to pass, as <i>Davina</i> sat in <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>, that <i>Davina</i> <i>cackled</i> to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I <i>lett</i> in an <i>lattie</i> of cedars, but the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the covenant of the <i>Duchess</i> remaineth under curtains.
    </li>
    <li>Then Nathan <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Davina</i>, Do all that is in thine <i>thumping cheat</i>; for <i>Gloria</i> is with thee.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> the same <i>nochy</i>, that the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>trolled</i> to Nathan, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Troll</i> and <i>cackle</i> <i>Davina</i> my <i>serving homie</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>nishta</i> build me an <i>lattie</i> to <i>lett</i> in:
    </li>
    <li>For I have not <i>letted</i> in an <i>lattie</i> since the <i>journo</i> that I brought up Israel unto this <i>journo</i>; but have <i>trolled</i> from <i>trolling lettie</i> to <i>trolling lettie</i>, and from <i>una</i> <i>bijou tabernaclette</i> to another.
    </li>
    <li>Wheresoever I have <i>minced</i> with all Israel, <i>cackled</i> I a <i>lav</i> to any of the <i>beaks</i> of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Why have ye not built me an <i>lattie</i> of cedars?
    </li>
    <li>Now therefore thus shalt thou <i>cackle</i> unto my <i>serving homie</i> <i>Davina</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts, I <i>lelled</i> thee from the sheepcote, even from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my <i>homies and palones</i> Israel:
    </li>
    <li>And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast <i>minced</i>, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the <i>dowry</i> <i>homies</i> that are in the earth.
    </li>
    <li>Also I will ordain a place for my <i>homies and palones</i> Israel, and will plant them, and they shall <i>lett</i> in their place, and shall be <i>trolled</i> <i>nishta</i>; <i>nishta</i> shall the <i>chavvies</i> of <i>naffness</i> waste them any more, as at the beginning,
    </li>
    <li>And since the time that I commanded <i>beaks</i> to be over my <i>homies and palones</i> Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I <i>cackle</i> thee that the <i>Duchess</i> will build thee an <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must <i>troll</i> to be with thy <i>aunties</i>, that I will raise up thy <i>maria</i> after thee, which shall be of thy <i>homie chavvies</i>; and I will establish <i>her</i> kingdom.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> shall build me an <i>lattie</i>, and I will stablish <i>her</i> throne for ever.
    </li>
    <li>I will be <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, and <i>she</i> shall be my <i>homie chavvie</i>: and I will not <i>lell</i> my mercy away from <i>her</i>, as I <i>lelled</i> it from <i>her</i> that was before thee:
    </li>
    <li>But I will settle <i>her</i> in mine <i>lattie</i> and in my kingdom for ever: and <i>her</i> throne shall be established for evermore.
    </li>
    <li>According to all these <i>lavs</i>, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan <i>cackle</i> unto <i>Davina</i>.

    <li>And <i>Davina</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>trolled</i> and sat before the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Who am I, O <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>, and what is mine <i>lattie</i>, that thou hast brought me hitherto?
    </li>
    <li>And yet this was a <i>pogey</i> <i>fakement</i> in thine <i>ogles</i>, O <i>Gloria</i>; for thou hast also <i>cackled</i> of thy <i>serving homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i> for a <i>dowry</i> while to <i>troll</i>, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a <i>homie</i> of high degree, O <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>What can <i>Davina</i> <i>cackle</i> more to thee for the honour of thy <i>serving homie</i>? for thou knowest thy <i>serving homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>O <i>Duchess</i>, for thy <i>serving homie</i>&#8216;s sake, and according to thine own <i>thumping cheat</i>, hast thou done all this <i>dowriness</i>, in making known all these <i>dowry</i> <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>O <i>Duchess</i>, there is none like thee, <i>nishta</i> is there any <i>Gloria</i> beside thee, according to all that we have <i>aunt nelled</i> with our <i>aunt nelly cheats</i>.

    <li>And what <i>una</i> nation in the earth is like thy <i>homies and palones</i> Israel, whom <i>Gloria</i> <i>trolled</i> to redeem to be <i>her</i> own <i>homies and palones</i>, to make thee a name of <i>dowriness</i> and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy <i>homies and palones</i> whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?
    </li>
    <li>For thy <i>homies and palones</i> Israel didst thou make thine own <i>homies and palones</i> for ever; and thou, <i>Duchess</i>, becamest their <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore now, <i>Duchess</i>, let the <i>fakement</i> that thou hast <i>cackled</i> concerning thy <i>serving homie</i> and concerning <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i> be established for ever, and do as thou hast <i>cackled</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, <i>cackling</i>, The <i>Duchess</i> of hosts is the <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, even a <i>Gloria</i> to Israel: and let the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Davina</i> thy <i>serving homie</i> be established before thee.
    </li>
    <li>For thou, O my <i>Gloria</i>, hast <i>cackled</i> thy <i>serving homie</i> that thou wilt build <i>her</i> an <i>lattie</i>: therefore thy <i>serving homie</i> hath found in <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> to pray before thee.
    </li>
    <li>And now, <i>Duchess</i>, thou art <i>Gloria</i>, and hast promised this goodness unto thy <i>serving homie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Now therefore let it please thee to bless the <i>lattie</i> of thy <i>serving homie</i>, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O <i>Duchess</i>, and it shall be <i>fabed</i> for ever.

    <li>Now after this it <i>trolled</i> to pass, that <i>Davina</i> <i>slapped</i> the <i>naffs</i>, and subdued them, and <i>lelled</i> Gath and her towns out of the <i>famble</i> of the <i>naffs</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>slapped</i> Moab; and the Moabites became <i>Davina</i>&#8216;s <i>serving homies</i>, and brought gifts.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> <i>slapped</i> Hadarezer <i>dowriest homie</i> of Zobah unto Hamath, as <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> to stablish <i>her</i> dominion by the river Euphrates.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> <i>lelled</i> from <i>her</i> a <i>mille</i> <i>rattling coves</i>, and <i>setter</i> <i>mille</i> horsemen, and <i>dewey dacha</i> <i>mille</i> footmen: <i>Davina</i> also houghed all the <i>trundling cheat</i> horses, but reserved of them an <i>chenter</i> <i>rattling coves</i>.

    <li>And when the Syrians of Damascus <i>trolled</i> to help Hadarezer <i>dowriest homie</i> of Zobah, <i>Davina</i> <i>ferricadoozaed</i> of the Syrians <i>dewey</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i> <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>Davina</i> put garrisons in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became <i>Davina</i>&#8216;s <i>serving homies</i>, and brought gifts. Thus the <i>Duchess</i> preserved <i>Davina</i> whithersoever <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> <i>lelled</i> the shields of <i>gelt</i> that were on the <i>serving homies</i> of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, <i>smokes</i> of Hadarezer, brought <i>Davina</i> <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry</i> brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the <i>fakements</i> of brass.
    </li>
    <li>Now when Tou <i>dowriest homie</i> of Hamath <i>aunt nelled</i> how <i>Davina</i> had smitten all the host of Hadarezer <i>dowriest homie</i> of Zobah;

    <li><i>She</i> <i>laued</i> Hadoram <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> to <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>Davina</i>, to enquire of <i>her</i> welfare, and to congratulate <i>her</i>, because <i>she</i> had <i>palavered</i> against Hadarezer, and smitten <i>her</i>; (for Hadarezer had <i>barney</i> with Tou;) and with <i>her</i> all manner of <i>fakements</i> of <i>gelt</i> and silver and brass.
    </li>
    <li>Them also <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>Davina</i> dedicated unto the <i>Duchess</i>, with the silver and the <i>gelt</i> that <i>she</i> brought from all these nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon, and from the <i>naffs</i>, and from Amalek.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover Abishai the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Zeruiah <i>ferricadoozaed</i> of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen <i>mille</i>.

    <li>And <i>she</i> put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became <i>Davina</i>&#8216;s <i>serving homies</i>. Thus the <i>Duchess</i> preserved <i>Davina</i> whithersoever <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i>.

    <li>So <i>Davina</i> reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>.

    <li>And Joab the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ahilud, recorder.

    <li>And Zadok the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ahitub, and Abimelech the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Abiathar, were the <i>godly homies</i>; and Shavsha was scribe;

    <h2>Chapter 19</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now it <i>trolled</i> to pass after this, that Nahash the <i>dowriest homie</i> of the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon <i>carked it</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> reigned in <i>her</i> stead.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> <i>cackled</i>, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nahash, because <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> shewed kindness to me. And <i>Davina</i> <i>laued</i> messengers to comfort <i>her</i> concerning <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>. So the <i>serving homies</i> of <i>Davina</i> <i>trolled</i> into the land of the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>princesses</i> of the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon <i>cackled</i> to Hanun, Thinkest thou that <i>Davina</i> doth honour thy <i>Auntie</i>, that <i>she</i> hath <i>laued</i> comforters unto thee? are not <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i> <i>troll</i> unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore Hanun <i>lelled</i> <i>Davina</i>&#8216;s <i>serving homies</i>, and shaved them, and cut off their <i>frocks</i> in the midst hard by their buttocks, and <i>laued</i> them away.
    </li>
    <li>Then there <i>trolled</i> certain, and <i>cackled</i> <i>Davina</i> how the <i>homies</i> were served. And <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> to meet them: for the <i>homies</i> were greatly ashamed. And the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i>, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon <i>vardad</i> that they had made themselves odious to <i>Davina</i>, Hanun and the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon <i>laued</i> a <i>mille</i> talents of silver to hire them <i>rattling coves</i> and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of Zobah.
    </li>
    <li>So they hired <i>trey dacha</i> and <i>dewey</i> <i>mille</i> <i>rattling coves</i>, and the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Maachah and <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>; who <i>trolled</i> and pitched before Medeba. And the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon gathered themselves together from their <i>smokes</i>, and <i>trolled</i> to battle.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>Davina</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> of it, <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> Joab, and all the host of the <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon <i>trolled</i> out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the <i>smoke</i>: and the <i>dowriest homies</i> that were <i>troll</i> were by themselves in the field.
    </li>
    <li>Now when Joab <i>vardad</i> that the battle was set against <i>her</i> before and behind, <i>she</i> chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>lettie</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> unto the <i>famble</i> of Abishai <i>her</i> <i>sister</i>, and they set themselves in array against the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, If the Syrians be too <i>butch</i> for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon be too <i>butch</i> for thee, then I will help thee.
    </li>
    <li>Be of <i>bona</i> courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our <i>homies and palones</i>, and for the <i>smokes</i> of our <i>Gloria</i>: and let the <i>Duchess</i> do that which is <i>bona</i> in <i>her</i> <i>vardaing</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So Joab and the <i>homies and palones</i> that were with <i>her</i> drew <i>ajax</i> before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon <i>vardad</i> that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai <i>her</i> <i>sister</i>, and entered into the <i>smoke</i>. Then Joab <i>trolled</i> to Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And when the Syrians <i>vardad</i> that they were put to the worse before Israel, they <i>laued</i> messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer <i>trolled</i> before them.
    </li>
    <li>And it was <i>cackled</i> <i>Davina</i>; and <i>she</i> gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and <i>trolled</i> upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when <i>Davina</i> had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they <i>palavered</i> with <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But the Syrians fled before Israel; and <i>Davina</i> <i>ferricadoozaed</i> of the Syrians <i>setter</i> <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i> which <i>palavered</i> in <i>rattling coves</i>, and <i>quarter dacha</i> <i>mille</i> footmen, and <i>ferricadozad</i> Shophach the captain of the host.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>serving homies</i> of Hadarezer <i>vardad</i> that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with <i>Davina</i>, and became <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>: <i>nishta</i> would the Syrians help the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon any more.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 20</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, that after the year was expired, at the time that <i>dowriest homies</i> <i>troll out</i> to battle, Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon, and <i>trolled</i> and besieged Rabbah. But <i>Davina</i> tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab <i>slapped</i> Rabbah, and <i>battyfanged</i> it.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> <i>lelled</i> the <i>mudge</i> of their <i>dowriest homie</i> from off <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>, and found it to weigh a talent of <i>gelt</i>, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon <i>Davina</i>&#8216;s <i>eke</i>: and <i>she</i> brought also exceeding <i>dowry</i> spoil out of the <i>smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> brought out the <i>homies and palones</i> that were in it, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt <i>Davina</i> with all the <i>smokes</i> of the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon. And <i>Davina</i> and all the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>trolled back to</i> Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> after this, that there arose <i>barney</i> at Gezer with the <i>naffs</i>; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite <i>ferricadoozaed</i> Sippai, that was of the <i>chavvies</i> of the <i>big butch homie</i>: and they were subdued.
    </li>
    <li>And there was <i>barney</i> again with the <i>naffs</i>; and Elhanan the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jair <i>ferricadoozaed</i> Lahmi the <i>sister</i> of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear <i>trolling fakement</i> was like a weaver&#8217;s beam.
    </li>
    <li>And yet again there was <i>barney</i> at Gath, where was a <i>homie</i> of <i>dowry</i> stature, whose <i>luppers</i> and toes were <i>quarter</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i>, <i>sey</i> on each <i>famble</i>, and <i>sey</i> on each <i>plate</i> and <i>she</i> also was the <i>homie chavvie</i> of the <i>big butch homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But when <i>she</i> defied Israel, Jonathan the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Shimea <i>Davina</i>&#8216;s <i>sister</i> <i>ferricadoozaed</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>These were born unto the <i>big butch homie</i> in Gath; and they fell by the <i>famble</i> of <i>Davina</i>, and by the <i>famble</i> of <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 21</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And <i>Sadie</i> stood up against Israel, and provoked <i>Davina</i> to number Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> <i>cackled</i> to Joab and to the rulers of the <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>troll</i>, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and <i>parker</i> the number of them to me, that I may know it.
    </li>
    <li>And Joab answered, The <i>Duchess</i> make <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i> an <i>chenter</i> times so many more as they be: but, my <i>Duchess</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>, are they not all my <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s <i>serving homies</i>? why then doth my <i>Duchess</i> require this <i>fakement</i>? why will <i>she</i> be a cause of <i>caterver</i> to Israel?
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lav</i> prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab <i>trolled off</i>, and <i>trolled</i> throughout all Israel, and <i>trolled</i> to Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And Joab <i>parkered</i> the sum of the number of the <i>homies and palones</i> unto <i>Davina</i>. And all they of Israel were a <i>mille</i> <i>mille</i> and an <i>chenter</i> <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i> that drew <i>dowry efink</i>: and Judah was <i>quarter</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> and <i>dacha</i> <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i> that drew <i>dowry efink</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But Levi and Benjamin counted <i>she</i> not among them: for the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lav</i> was abominable to Joab.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Gloria</i> was displeased with this <i>fakement</i>; therefore <i>she</i> <i>slapped</i> Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Gloria</i>, I have <i>kertervered</i> greatly, because I have done this <i>fakement</i>: but now, I beseech thee, do away the <i>codness</i> of thy <i>serving homie</i>; for I have done <i>dowry</i> foolishly.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Gad, <i>Davina</i>&#8216;s seer, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Troll</i> and <i>cackle</i> <i>Davina</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, I offer thee <i>trey</i> <i>fakements</i>: choose thee <i>una</i> of them, that I may do it unto thee.
    </li>
    <li>So Gad <i>trolled</i> to <i>Davina</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, Choose thee
    </li>
    <li>Either <i>trey</i> years&#8217; <i>nix munjarlee</i>; or <i>trey</i> months to be <i>battyfanged</i> before thy foes, while that the <i>dowry efink</i> of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else <i>trey</i> days the <i>dowry efink</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, even the <i>bad style</i>, in the land, and the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what <i>lav</i> I shall <i>parker</i> again to <i>her</i> that <i>laued</i> me.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Gad, I am in a <i>dowry</i> <i>hettie</i>: let me fall now into the <i>famble</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>; for <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry</i> are <i>her</i> mercies: but let me not fall into the <i>famble</i> of <i>homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So the <i>Duchess</i> <i>laued</i> <i>bad style</i> upon Israel: and there fell of Israel <i>setter dacha</i> <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>laued</i> an <i>fairy</i> unto Jerusalem to <i>battyfang</i> it: and as <i>she</i> was destroying, the <i>Duchess</i> beheld, and <i>she</i> repented <i>her</i> of the <i>nana</i>, and <i>cackled</i> to the <i>fairy</i> that <i>battyfanged</i>, It is enough, stay now thine <i>famble</i>. And the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> lifted up <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i>, and <i>vardad</i> the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn <i>dowry efink</i> in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> stretched out over Jerusalem. Then <i>Davina</i> and the <i>fungi</i> of Israel, who were clothed in <i>nylon</i>, fell upon their <i>ekes</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Gloria</i>, Is it not I that commanded the <i>homies and palones</i> to be numbered? even I it is that have <i>kertervered</i> and done <i>nana</i> indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let thine <i>famble</i>, I pray thee, O <i>Duchess</i> my <i>Gloria</i>, be on me, and on my <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>; but not on thy <i>homies and palones</i>, that they should be plagued.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> commanded Gad to <i>cackle</i> to <i>Davina</i>, that <i>Davina</i> should <i>troll</i> up, and set up an <i>grovelling fakement</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i> in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> <i>trolled</i> up at the <i>cackling</i> of Gad, which <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> in the name of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Ornan turned back, and <i>vardad</i> the <i>fairy</i>; and <i>her</i> <i>quarter</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> with <i>her</i> hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.
    </li>
    <li>And as <i>Davina</i> <i>trolled</i> to Ornan, Ornan looked and <i>vardad</i> <i>Davina</i>, and <i>trolled</i> out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to <i>Davina</i> with <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> to the ground.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>Davina</i> <i>cackled</i> to Ornan, Grant me the place of this threshingfloor, that I may build an <i>grovelling fakement</i> therein unto the <i>Duchess</i>: thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Ornan <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Davina</i>, <i>lell</i> it to thee, and let my <i>Duchess</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> do that which is <i>bona</i> in <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i>: lo, I <i>parker</i> thee the oxen also for burnt <i>parkerings</i>, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the <i>carnish</i> <i>parkering</i>; I <i>parker</i> it all.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>Davina</i> <i>cackled</i> to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not <i>lell</i> that which is thine for the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>nishta</i> offer burnt <i>parkerings</i> <i>nanti</i> cost.
    </li>
    <li>So <i>Davina</i> <i>parkered</i> to Ornan for the place <i>sey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>medzers</i> of <i>gelt</i> by weight.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> built there an <i>grovelling fakement</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>, and offered burnt <i>parkerings</i> and peace <i>parkerings</i>, and <i>screeched</i> upon the <i>Duchess</i>; and <i>she</i> answered <i>her</i> from heaven by <i>binco fakement</i> upon the <i>grovelling fakement</i> of burnt <i>parkering</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> commanded the <i>fairy</i>; and <i>she</i> put up <i>her</i> <i>dowry efink</i> again into the sheath thereof.
    </li>
    <li>At that time when <i>Davina</i> <i>vardad</i> that the <i>Duchess</i> had answered <i>her</i> in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then <i>she</i> sacrificed there.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>bijou tabernaclette</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, which <i>Maureen</i> made in the <i>nishta smoke</i>, and the <i>grovelling fakement</i> of the burnt <i>parkering</i>, were at that season in the high place at Gibeon.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>Davina</i> could not <i>troll</i> before it to enquire of <i>Gloria</i>: for <i>she</i> was afraid because of the <i>dowry efink</i> of the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 22</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Then <i>Davina</i> <i>cackled</i>, This is the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>, and this is the <i>grovelling fakement</i> of the burnt <i>parkering</i> for Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel; and <i>she</i> set masons to hew wrought stones to build the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance <i>nanti</i> weight;
    </li>
    <li>Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought <i>dowry</i> cedar wood to <i>Davina</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> <i>cackled</i>, Solomon my <i>homie chavvie</i> is <i>bean</i> and tender, and the <i>lattie</i> that is to be builded for the <i>Duchess</i> must be exceeding magnifical, of fame and of <i>fabeness</i> throughout all countries: I will therefore now make preparation for it. So <i>Davina</i> prepared <i>dowrily</i> before <i>her</i> <i>carking it</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> for Solomon <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>, and charged <i>her</i> to build an <i>lattie</i> for the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> <i>cackled</i> to Solomon, My <i>homie chavvie</i>, as for me, it was in my mind to build an <i>lattie</i> unto the name of the <i>Duchess</i> my <i>Gloria</i>:
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> to me, <i>cackling</i>, Thou hast shed blood <i>dowrily</i>, and hast made <i>dowry</i> wars: <i>nishta</i> build an <i>lattie</i> unto my name, because thou hast shed <i>dowry</i> blood upon the earth in my <i>vardaing</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, a <i>homie chavvie</i> shall be born to thee, who shall be a <i>homie</i> of <i>lettie</i>; and I will <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> <i>lettie</i> from all <i>her</i> enemies round about: for <i>her</i> name shall be Solomon, and I will <i>parker</i> peace and quietness unto Israel in <i>her</i> days.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> shall build an <i>lattie</i> for my name; and <i>she</i> shall be my <i>homie chavvie</i>, and I will be <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>; and I will establish the throne of <i>her</i> kingdom over Israel for ever.
    </li>
    <li>Now, my <i>homie chavvie</i>, the <i>Duchess</i> be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i>, as <i>she</i> hath <i>cackled</i> of thee.
    </li>
    <li>Only the <i>Duchess</i> <i>parker</i> thee wisdom and understanding, and <i>parker</i> thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the <i>dowry lavs</i> and judgments which the <i>Duchess</i> charged <i>Maureen</i> with concerning Israel: be <i>butch</i>, and of <i>bona</i> courage; dread not, <i>nishta</i> be dismayed.
    </li>
    <li>Now, <i>varda</i>, in my trouble I have prepared for the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> an <i>chenter</i> <i>mille</i> talents of <i>gelt</i>, and a <i>mille</i> <i>mille</i> talents of silver; and of brass and iron <i>nanti</i> weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning <i>homies</i> for every manner of <i>acting dickey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Of the <i>gelt</i>, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and the <i>Duchess</i> be with thee.
    </li>
    <li><i>Davina</i> also commanded all the <i>princesses</i> of Israel to help Solomon <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Is not the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i> with you? and hath <i>she</i> not <i>parkered</i> you <i>lettie</i> on every side? for <i>she</i> hath <i>parkered</i> the inhabitants of the land into mine <i>famble</i>; and the land is subdued before the <i>Duchess</i>, and before <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now set your <i>thumping cheat</i> and your <i>nishta lucoddy</i> to <i>charper</i> the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i>; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>, to <i>parker</i> the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the covenant of the <i>Duchess</i>, and the <i>fabulosa</i> <i>fakements</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, into the <i>lattie</i> that is to be built to the name of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 23</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>So when <i>Davina</i> was <i>badge</i> and full of days, <i>she</i> made Solomon <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> over Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> gathered together all the <i>princesses</i> of Israel, with the <i>godly homies</i> and the Levites.
    </li>
    <li>Now the Levites were numbered from the age of <i>trey dacha</i> years and upward: and their number by their polls, <i>homie</i> by <i>homie</i>, was <i>trey dacha</i> and <i>say dooe</i> <i>mille</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Of which, <i>dewey dacha</i> and <i>quarter</i> <i>mille</i> were to set forward the <i>acting dickey</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>; and <i>sey</i> <i>mille</i> were <i>hilda handcuffs</i> and <i>beaks</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Moreover <i>quarter</i> <i>mille</i> were porters; and <i>quarter</i> <i>mille</i> praised the <i>Duchess</i> with the instruments which I made, <i>cackled</i> <i>Davina</i>, to praise therewith.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> <i>medzered</i> them into courses among the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Levi, namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
    </li>
    <li>Of the Gershonites were, Laadan, and Shimei.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>homie chavvies</i> of Laadan; the <i>dowriest</i> was Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, <i>trey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>homie chavvies</i> of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, <i>trey</i>. These were the <i>dowriest</i> of the <i>aunties</i> of Laadan.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These <i>quarter</i> were the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Shimei.
    </li>
    <li>And Jahath was the <i>dowriest</i>, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many <i>homie chavvies</i>; therefore they were in <i>una</i> reckoning, according to their <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>homie chavvies</i> of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, <i>quarter</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>homie chavvies</i> of Amram; Aaron and <i>Maureen</i>: and Aaron was separated, that <i>she</i> should <i>bonafy</i> the most <i>fabulosa</i> <i>fakements</i>, <i>she</i> and <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> for ever, to burn <i>smelly</i> before the <i>Duchess</i>, to minister unto <i>her</i>, and to bless in <i>her</i> name for ever.
    </li>
    <li>Now concerning <i>Maureen</i> the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> were named of the tribe of Levi.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>homie chavvies</i> of <i>Maureen</i> were, Gershom, and Eliezer.
    </li>
    <li>Of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Gershom, Shebuel was the <i>dowriest</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the <i>dowriest</i>. And Eliezer had none other <i>homie chavvies</i>; but the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Rehabiah were <i>dowry</i> many.
    </li>
    <li>Of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Izhar; Shelomith the <i>dowriest</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the <i>quarter</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Uzziel; Micah the first and Jesiah the second.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>homie chavvies</i> of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The <i>homie chavvies</i> of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish.
    </li>
    <li>And Eleazar <i>carked it</i>, and had no <i>homie chavvies</i>, but <i>palone chavvies</i>: and their <i>sisters</i> the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Kish <i>lelled</i> them.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>homie chavvies</i> of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, <i>trey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>These were the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Levi after the <i>lattie</i> of their <i>aunties</i>; even the <i>dowriest</i> of the <i>aunties</i>, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the <i>acting dickey</i> for the service of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, from the age of <i>dewey dacha</i> years and upward.
    </li>

    <li>But <i>Davina</i> <i>lelled</i> not the number of them from <i>dewey dacha</i> years <i>badge</i> and under: because the <i>Duchess</i> had <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i> would increase Israel like to the <i>twinkling fakements</i> of the heavens.
    </li>
    <li>Joab the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Zeruiah began to number, but <i>she</i> finished not, because there fell wrath for it against Israel; <i>nishta</i> was the number put in the account of the chronicles of <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>Davina</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And over the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>gelt</i> was Azmaveth the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Adiel: and over the storehouses in the fields, in the <i>smokes</i>, and in the villages, and in the <i>butch latties</i>, was Jehonathan the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Uzziah:
    </li>
    <li>And over them that did the <i>acting dickey</i> of the field for tillage of the ground was Ezri the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Chelub:
    </li>
    <li>And over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite: over the increase of the vineyards for the <i>sherry</i> cellars was Zabdi the Shiphmite:
    </li>
    <li>And over the olive trees and the sycomore trees that were in the low plains was Baalhanan the Gederite: and over the cellars of <i>lube</i> was Joash:
    </li>
    <li>And over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite: and over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphat the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Adlai:
    </li>
    <li>Over the camels also was Obil the Ishmaelite: and over the asses was Jehdeiah the Meronothite:
    </li>
    <li>And over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagerite. All these were the rulers of the substance which was <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>Davina</i>&#8216;s.
    </li>
    <li>Also Jonathan <i>Davina</i>&#8216;s uncle was a counsellor, a wise <i>homie</i>, and a scribe: and Jehiel the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Hachmoni was with the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>homie chavvies</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And Ahithophel was the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s counsellor: and Hushai the Archite was the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s companion:
    </li>
    <li>And after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Benaiah, and Abiathar: and the general of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s army was Joab.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 28</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> assembled all the <i>princesses</i> of Israel, the <i>princesses</i> of the tribes, and the captains of the companies that ministered to the <i>dowriest homie</i> by course, and the captains over the <i>milles</i>, and captains over the <i>chenters</i>, and the stewards over all the substance and <i>fakement</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and of <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>, with the <i>hilda handcuffs</i>, and with the <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i>, and with all the valiant <i>homies</i>, unto Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>Davina</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> stood up upon <i>her</i> <i>plates</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>aunt nell</i> me, my <i>sisters</i>, and my <i>homies and palones</i>: As for me, I had in mine <i>thumping cheat</i> to build an <i>lattie</i> of <i>lettie</i> for the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the covenant of the <i>Duchess</i>, and for the footstool of our <i>Gloria</i>, and had made ready for the building:
    </li>
    <li>But <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, <i>nishta</i> build an <i>lattie</i> for my name, because thou hast been a <i>homie</i> of <i>barney</i>, and hast shed blood.
    </li>
    <li>Howbeit the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel chose me before all the <i>lattie</i> of my <i>Auntie</i> to be <i>dowriest homie</i> over Israel for ever: for <i>she</i> hath chosen Judah to be the ruler; and of the <i>lattie</i> of Judah, the <i>lattie</i> of my <i>Auntie</i>; and among the <i>homie chavvies</i> of my <i>Auntie</i> <i>she</i> liked me to make me <i>dowriest homie</i> over all Israel:
    </li>
    <li>And of all my <i>homie chavvies</i>, (for the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>parkered</i> me many <i>homie chavvies</i>,) <i>she</i> hath chosen Solomon my <i>homie chavvie</i> to <i>lett</i> upon the throne of the kingdom of the <i>Duchess</i> over Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, Solomon thy <i>homie chavvie</i>, <i>she</i> shall build my <i>lattie</i> and my courts: for I have chosen <i>her</i> to be my <i>homie chavvie</i>, and I will be <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover I will establish <i>her</i> kingdom for ever, if <i>she</i> be constant to do my <i>butch lavs</i> and my judgments, as at this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now therefore in the <i>vardaing</i> of all Israel the <i>punters</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and in the audience of our <i>Gloria</i>, keep and <i>charper</i> for all the <i>butch lavs</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i>: that ye may possess this <i>bona</i> land, and leave it for an inheritance for your <i>chavvies</i> after you for ever.
    </li>
    <li>And thou, Solomon my <i>homie chavvie</i>, know thou the <i>Gloria</i> of thy <i>Auntie</i>, and serve <i>her</i> with a <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> and with a willing mind: for the <i>Duchess</i> searcheth all <i>thumping cheats</i>, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou <i>charper</i> <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> will be found of thee; but if thou forsake <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> will cast thee off for ever.
    </li>
    <li><i>Lell</i> heed now; for the <i>Duchess</i> hath chosen thee to build an <i>lattie</i> for the sanctuary: be <i>butch</i>, and do it.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>Davina</i> <i>parkered</i> to Solomon <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> the pattern of the porch, and of the <i>latties</i> thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat,
    </li>
    <li>And the pattern of all that <i>she</i> had by the <i>Fairy</i>, of the courts of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and of all the chambers round about, of the treasuries of the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and of the treasuries of the dedicated <i>fakements</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Also for the courses of the <i>godly homies</i> and the Levites, and for all the <i>acting dickey</i> of the service of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and for all the <i>fakements</i> of service in the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> <i>parkered</i> of <i>gelt</i> by weight for <i>fakements</i> of <i>gelt</i>, for all instruments of all manner of service; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every kind of service:
    </li>
    <li>Even the weight for the candlesticks of <i>gelt</i>, and for their <i>bincos</i> of <i>gelt</i>, by weight for every candlestick, and for the <i>bincos</i> thereof: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, both for the candlestick, and also for the <i>bincos</i> thereof, according to the use of every candlestick.
    </li>
    <li>And by weight <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> <i>gelt</i> for the tables of shewbread, for every table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver:
    </li>
    <li>Also pure <i>gelt</i> for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the cups: and for the golden basons <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> <i>gelt</i> by weight for every bason; and likewise silver by weight for every bason of silver:
    </li>
    <li>And for the <i>grovelling fakement</i> of <i>smelly</i> refined <i>gelt</i> by weight; and <i>gelt</i> for the pattern of the <i>trundling cheat</i> of the cherubims, that spread out their wings, and covered the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the covenant of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>All this, <i>cackled</i> <i>Davina</i>, the <i>Duchess</i> made me understand in <i>screeving</i> by <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> upon me, even all the works of this pattern.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> <i>cackled</i> to Solomon <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>, Be <i>butch</i> and of <i>bona</i> courage, and do it: fear not, <i>nishta</i> be dismayed: for the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>, even my <i>Gloria</i>, will be with thee; <i>she</i> will not fail thee, <i>nishta</i> forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the <i>acting dickey</i> for the service of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, the courses of the <i>godly homies</i> and the Levites, even they shall be with thee for all the service of the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>: and there shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing skilful <i>homie</i>, for any manner of service: also the <i>princesses</i> and all the <i>homies and palones</i> will be wholly at thy <i>butch lav</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 29</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Furthermore <i>Davina</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto all the <i>punters</i>, Solomon my <i>homie chavvie</i>, whom alone <i>Gloria</i> hath chosen, is yet <i>bean</i> and tender, and the <i>acting dickey</i> is <i>dowry</i>: for the <i>dowry lattie</i> is not for <i>homie</i>, but for the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now I have prepared with all my might for the <i>lattie</i> of my <i>Gloria</i> the <i>gelt</i> for <i>fakements</i> to be made of <i>gelt</i>, and the silver for <i>fakements</i> of silver, and the brass for <i>fakements</i> of brass, the iron for <i>fakements</i> of iron, and wood for <i>fakements</i> of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover, because I have set my affection to the <i>lattie</i> of my <i>Gloria</i>, I have of mine own proper <i>bona</i>, of <i>gelt</i> and silver, which I have <i>parkered</i> to the <i>lattie</i> of my <i>Gloria</i>, over and above all that I have prepared for the <i>fabulosa</i> <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Even <i>trey</i> <i>mille</i> talents of <i>gelt</i>, of the <i>gelt</i> of Ophir, and <i>setter</i> <i>mille</i> talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the <i>latties</i> withal:
    </li>
    <li>The <i>gelt</i> for <i>fakements</i> of <i>gelt</i>, and the silver for <i>fakements</i> of silver, and for all manner of <i>acting dickey</i> to be made by the <i>fambles</i> of artificers. And who then is willing to consecrate <i>her</i> service this <i>journo</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>dowriest</i> of the <i>aunties</i> and <i>princesses</i> of the tribes of Israel and the captains of <i>milles</i> and of <i>chenters</i>, with the rulers of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>acting dickey</i>, offered willingly,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>parkered</i> for the service of the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> of <i>gelt</i> <i>chinker</i> <i>mille</i> talents and <i>dacha</i> <i>mille</i> drams, and of silver <i>dacha</i> <i>mille</i> talents, and of brass eighteen <i>mille</i> talents, and <i>una</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>mille</i> talents of iron.
    </li>
    <li>And they with whom precious stones were found <i>parkered</i> them to the <i>gelt</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, by the <i>famble</i> of Jehiel the Gershonite.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>homies and palones</i> rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> they offered willingly to the <i>Duchess</i>: and <i>Davina</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> also rejoiced with <i>dowry</i> joy.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore <i>Davina</i> <i>fabed</i> the <i>Duchess</i> before all the <i>punters</i>: and <i>Davina</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>fabed</i> be thou, <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel our <i>Auntie</i>, for ever and ever.
    </li>
    <li>Thine, O <i>Duchess</i> is the <i>dowriness</i>, and the power, and the <i>fabeness</i>, and the victory, and the <i>fabularity</i>: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O <i>Duchess</i>, and thou art exalted as <i>eke</i> above all.
    </li>
    <li>Both riches and honour <i>troll</i> of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine <i>famble</i> is power and might; and in thine <i>famble</i> it is to make <i>dowry</i>, and to <i>parker</i> <i>butchness</i> unto all.
    </li>
    <li>Now therefore, our <i>Gloria</i>, we thank thee, and praise thy <i>fabe</i> name.
    </li>
    <li>But who am I, and what is my <i>homies and palones</i>, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all <i>fakements</i> <i>troll</i> of thee, and of thine own have we <i>parkered</i> thee.
    </li>
    <li>For we are strangers before thee, and <i>trollers</i>, as were all our <i>aunties</i>: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none <i>letting</i>.
    </li>
    <li>O <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i>, all this store that we have prepared to build thee an <i>lattie</i> for thine <i>fabulosa</i> name <i>trolleth</i> of thine <i>famble</i>, and is all thine own.
    </li>
    <li>I know also, my <i>Gloria</i>, that thou triest the <i>thumping cheat</i>, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine <i>thumping cheat</i> I have willingly offered all these <i>fakements</i>: and now have I <i>vardad</i> with joy thy <i>homies and palones</i>, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.
    </li>
    <li>O <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our <i>aunties</i>, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the <i>thumping cheat</i> of thy <i>homies and palones</i>, and prepare their <i>thumping cheat</i> unto thee:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>parker</i> unto Solomon my <i>homie chavvie</i> a <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>, to keep thy <i>butch lavs</i>, thy testimonies, and thy <i>dowry lavs</i>, and to do all these <i>fakements</i>, and to build the <i>dowry lattie</i>, for the which I have made provision.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> <i>cackled</i> to all the <i>punters</i>, Now bless the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i>. And all the <i>punters</i> <i>fabed</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of their <i>aunties</i>, and bowed down their <i>ekes</i>, and worshipped the <i>Duchess</i>, and the <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they sacrificed <i>parkers</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>, and offered burnt <i>parkerings</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>, on the morrow after that <i>journo</i>, even a <i>mille</i> bullocks, a <i>mille</i> rams, and a <i>mille</i> lambs, with their <i>buvare</i> <i>parkerings</i>, and <i>parkers</i> in abundance for all Israel:
    </li>
    <li>And did <i>jarry</i> and <i>buvare</i> before the <i>Duchess</i> on that <i>journo</i> with <i>dowry</i> gladness. And they made Solomon the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>Davina</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> the second time, and anointed <i>her</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i> to be the <i>dowriest</i> governor, and Zadok to be <i>godly homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then Solomon sat on the throne of the <i>Duchess</i> as <i>dowriest homie</i> instead of <i>Davina</i> <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And all the <i>princesses</i>, and the <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i>, and all the <i>homie chavvies</i> likewise of <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>Davina</i>, submitted themselves unto Solomon the <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> magnified Solomon exceedingly in the <i>vardaing</i> of all Israel, and bestowed upon <i>her</i> such royal <i>fabularity</i> as had not been on any <i>dowriest homie</i> before <i>her</i> in Israel.
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>Davina</i> the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And the time that <i>she</i> reigned over Israel was <i>quarter dacha</i> years; <i>setter</i> years reigned <i>she</i> in Hebron, and <i>trey dacha</i> and <i>trey</i> years reigned <i>she</i> in Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>carked it</i> in a <i>bona</i> <i>badgeness</i>, full of days, riches, and honour: and Solomon <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> reigned in <i>her</i> stead.
    </li>
    <li>Now the acts of <i>Davina</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>, first and last, <i>varda</i>, they are <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of Samuel the seer, and in the <i>glossy</i> of Nathan the prophet, and in the <i>glossy</i> of Gad the seer,
    </li>
    <li>With all <i>her</i> reign and <i>her</i> might, and the times that <i>trolled</i> over <i>her</i>, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.
