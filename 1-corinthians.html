    <h1>1 Corinthians</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Pauline</i>, a <i>serving homie</i> of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, <i>screeched</i> to be an apostle, separated unto the <i>gossip</i> of <i>Gloria</i>,
    </li>
    <li>(Which <i>she</i> had promised afore by <i>her</i> prophets in the <i>fabulosa</i> <i>glossies</i>,)
    </li>
    <li>Concerning <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> our <i>Duchess</i>, which was made of the <i>maria</i> of <i>Davina</i> according to the flesh;
    </li>
    <li>And <i>screeched</i> to be the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> with power, according to the <i>Fairy</i> of holiness, by the resurrection from the <i>stiff</i>:
    </li>
    <li>By whom we have <i>lalled</i> <i>gracie</i> and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for <i>her</i> name:
    </li>
    <li>Among whom are ye also the <i>screeched</i> of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>:
    </li>
    <li>To all that be in Rome, beloved of <i>Gloria</i>, <i>screeched</i> to be saints: <i>gracie</i> to you and peace from <i>Gloria</i> our <i>Auntie</i>, and the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>First, I thank my <i>Gloria</i> through <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> for you all, that your faith is <i>cackled</i> of throughout the whole world.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>Gloria</i> is my <i>varda-ing fakement</i>, whom I serve with my <i>Fairy</i> in the <i>gossip</i> of <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>, that <i>nanti</i> ceasing I make mention of you always in my <i>meshigener mutterings</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of <i>Gloria</i> to <i>troll</i> unto you.
    </li>
    <li>For I long to <i>varda</i> you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;
    </li>
    <li>That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.
    </li>
    <li>Now I would not have you ignorant, <i>sisters</i>, that oftentimes I purposed to <i>troll</i> unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other <i>nishta kosher homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.
    </li>
    <li>So, as <i>dowry</i> as in me is, I am ready to <i>cackle</i> the <i>gossip</i> to you that are at Rome also.
    </li>
    <li>For I am not ashamed of the <i>gossip</i> of <i>Crystal</i>: for it is the power of <i>Gloria</i> unto salvation to every <i>una</i> that believeth; to the <i>kosher homie</i> first, and also to the Greek.
    </li>
    <li>For therein is the <i>bonaness</i> of <i>Gloria</i> revealed from faith to faith: as it is <i>screeved</i>, The just shall live by faith.
    </li>
    <li>For the wrath of <i>Gloria</i> is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of <i>homies</i>, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;
    </li>
    <li>Because that which may be known of <i>Gloria</i> is manifest in them; for <i>Gloria</i> hath shewed it unto them.
    </li>
    <li>For the invisible <i>fakements</i> of <i>her</i> from the creation of the world are clearly <i>vardad</i>, being understood by the <i>fakements</i> that are made, even <i>her</i> eternal power and Godhead; so that they are <i>nanti</i> excuse:
    </li>
    <li>Because that, when they knew <i>Gloria</i>, they glorified <i>her</i> not as <i>Gloria</i>, <i>nishta</i> were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their <i>dizzy</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> was <i>munged</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
    </li>
    <li>And changed the <i>fabeness</i> of the uncorruptible <i>Gloria</i> into an image made like to corruptible <i>homie</i>, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore <i>Gloria</i> also <i>parkered</i> them up to <i>nishta sparkle</i> through the lusts of their own <i>thumping cheats</i>, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:
    </li>
    <li>Who changed the truth of <i>Gloria</i> into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is <i>fabed</i> for ever. <i>Larlou</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For this cause <i>Gloria</i> <i>parkered</i> them up unto vile affections: for even their <i>palones</i> did change the natural use into that which is against nature:
    </li>
    <li>And likewise also the <i>homies</i>, leaving the natural use of the <i>palone</i>, burned in their lust <i>una</i> toward another; <i>homies</i> with <i>homies</i> working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.
    </li>
    <li>And even as they did not like to retain <i>Gloria</i> in their knowledge, <i>Gloria</i> <i>parkered</i> them over to a reprobate mind, to do those <i>fakements</i> which are not convenient;
    </li>
    <li>Being filled with all unrighteousness, <i>charvering</i>, <i>naffness</i>, <i>ogling</i>, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,
    </li>
    <li>Backbiters, haters of <i>Gloria</i>, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of <i>nana</i> <i>fakements</i>, disobedient to parents,
    </li>
    <li><i>Nanti</i> understanding, covenantbreakers, <i>nanti</i> natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:
    </li>
    <li>Who knowing the judgment of <i>Gloria</i>, that they which commit such <i>fakements</i> are <i>bona</i> of <i>carking it</i>, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Therefore thou art inexcusable, O <i>homie</i>, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But we are sure that the judgment of <i>Gloria</i> is according to truth against them which commit such <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And thinkest thou this, O <i>homie</i>, that judgest them which do such <i>fakements</i>, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of <i>Gloria</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Or despisest thou the riches of <i>her</i> goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of <i>Gloria</i> leadeth thee to repentance?
    </li>
    <li>But after thy hardness and impenitent <i>thumping cheat</i> treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the <i>journo</i> of wrath and revelation of the <i>bona</i> judgment of <i>Gloria</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Who will render to every <i>homie</i> according to <i>her</i> deeds:
    </li>
    <li>To them who by patient continuance in well doing <i>charper</i> for <i>fabeness</i> and honour and immortality, eternal life:
    </li>
    <li>But unto them that are contentious, and <i>nix</i> obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,
    </li>
    <li>Tribulation and anguish, upon every <i>nishta lucoddy</i> of <i>homie</i> that doeth <i>nana</i>, of the <i>kosher homie</i> first, and also of the <i>nishta kosher homie</i>;
    </li>
    <li>But <i>fabeness</i>, honour, and peace, to every <i>homie</i> that worketh <i>bona</i>, to the <i>kosher homie</i> first, and also to the <i>nishta kosher homie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>For there is no respect of persons with <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For as many as have <i>kertervered</i> <i>nanti</i> law shall also perish <i>nanti</i> law: and as many as have <i>kertervered</i> in the law shall be judged by the law;
    </li>
    <li>(For not the hearers of the law are just before <i>Gloria</i>, but the doers of the law shall be justified.
    </li>
    <li>For when the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>, which have not the law, do by nature the <i>fakements</i> contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:
    </li>
    <li>Which shew the <i>acting dickey</i> of the law <i>screeved</i> in their <i>thumping cheats</i>, their conscience also bearing <i>varda-ing fakement</i>, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing <i>una</i> another;)
    </li>
    <li>In the <i>journo</i> when <i>Gloria</i> shall <i>beak</i> the secrets of <i>homies</i> by <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> according to my <i>gossip</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, thou art <i>screeched</i> a <i>kosher homie</i>, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of <i>Gloria</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And knowest <i>her</i> will, and approvest the <i>fakements</i> that are more <i>fantabulosa</i>, being instructed out of the law;
    </li>
    <li>And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the <i>nanti varda</i>, a <i>sparkle</i> of them which are in <i>munge</i>,
    </li>
    <li>An instructor of the <i>dizzy</i>, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.
    </li>
    <li>Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a <i>homie</i> should not <i>sharper</i>, dost thou <i>sharper</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Thou that <i>cackleth</i> a <i>homie</i> should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?
    </li>
    <li>Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou <i>Gloria</i>?
    </li>
    <li>For the name of <i>Gloria</i> is blasphemed among the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> through you, as it is <i>screeved</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the <i>bonaness</i> of the law, shall not <i>her</i> uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?
    </li>
    <li>And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, <i>beak</i> thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> is not a <i>kosher homie</i>, which is <i>una</i> outwardly; <i>nishta</i> is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> is a <i>kosher homie</i>, which is <i>una</i> inwardly; and circumcision is that of the <i>thumping cheat</i>, in the <i>Fairy</i>, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of <i>homies</i>, but of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>What advantage then hath the <i>kosher homie</i>? or what profit is there of circumcision?
    </li>
    <li><i>Dowry</i> every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of <i>Gloria</i> <i>nanti</i> effect?
    </li>
    <li><i>Gloria</i> forbid: <i>any road up</i>, let <i>Gloria</i> be true, but every <i>homie</i> a liar; as it is <i>screeved</i>, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.
    </li>
    <li>But if our unrighteousness commend the <i>bonaness</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, what shall we <i>cackle</i>? Is <i>Gloria</i> unrighteous who <i>lelleth</i> <i>the rights</i>? (I <i>cackle</i> as a <i>homie</i>)
    </li>
    <li><i>Gloria</i> forbid: for then how shall <i>Gloria</i> <i>beak</i> the world?
    </li>
    <li>For if the truth of <i>Gloria</i> hath more abounded through my lie unto <i>her</i> <i>fabeness</i>; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?
    </li>
    <li>And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we <i>cackle</i>,) Let us do <i>nana</i>, that <i>bona</i> may <i>troll</i>? whose damnation is just.
    </li>
    <li>What then? are we <i>benar</i> than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both <i>kosher homies</i> and <i>nishta kosher homies</i>, that they are all under <i>kertever</i>;
    </li>
    <li>As it is <i>screeved</i>, There is none <i>bona</i>, no, not <i>una</i>:
    </li>
    <li>There is none that understandeth, there is none that <i>charpereth</i> after <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>They are all <i>trolled</i> out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth <i>bona</i>, no, not <i>una</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their <i>polaris</i> they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:
    </li>
    <li>Whose <i>screech</i> is full of cursing and bitterness:
    </li>
    <li>Their <i>plates</i> are swift to shed blood:
    </li>
    <li>Destruction and misery are in their ways:
    </li>
    <li>And the way of peace have they not known:
    </li>
    <li>There is no fear of <i>Gloria</i> before their <i>ogles</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now we know that what <i>fakements</i> soever the law <i>cackleth</i>, it <i>cackleth</i> to them who are under the law: that every <i>screech</i> may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in <i>her</i> <i>vardaing</i>: for by the law is the knowledge of <i>kertever</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But now the <i>bonaness</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>nanti</i> the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;
    </li>
    <li>Even the <i>bonaness</i> of <i>Gloria</i> which is by faith of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:
    </li>
    <li>For all have <i>kertervered</i>, and <i>troll</i> short of the <i>fabeness</i> of <i>Gloria</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Being justified freely by <i>her</i> <i>gracie</i> through the redemption that is in <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Whom <i>Gloria</i> hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in <i>her</i> blood, to <i>screech</i> <i>her</i> <i>bonaness</i> for the remission of <i>kertervers</i> that are past, through the forbearance of <i>Gloria</i>;
    </li>
    <li>To <i>screech</i>, I <i>cackle</i>, at this time <i>her</i> <i>bonaness</i>: that <i>she</i> might be just, and the justifier of <i>her</i> which believeth in <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore we conclude that a <i>homie</i> is justified by faith <i>nanti</i> the deeds of the law.
    </li>
    <li>Is <i>she</i> the <i>Gloria</i> of the <i>kosher homies</i> only? is <i>she</i> not also of the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>? Yes, of the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> also:
    </li>
    <li><i>Vardaing</i> it is <i>una</i> <i>Gloria</i>, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.
    </li>
    <li>Do we then make void the law through faith? <i>Gloria</i> forbid: <i>any road up</i>, we establish the law.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>What shall we <i>cackle</i> then that Abraham our <i>Auntie</i>, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?
    </li>
    <li>For if Abraham were justified by works, <i>she</i> hath whereof to <i>fabeness</i>; but not before <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For what <i>cackleth</i> the <i>glossy</i>? Abraham believed <i>Gloria</i>, and it was counted unto <i>her</i> for <i>bonaness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now to <i>her</i> that worketh is the <i>parkering</i> not reckoned of <i>gracie</i>, but of debt.
    </li>
    <li>But to <i>her</i> that worketh not, but believeth on <i>her</i> that justifieth the ungodly, <i>her</i> faith is counted for <i>bonaness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Even as <i>Davina</i> also describeth the blessedness of the <i>homie</i>, unto whom <i>Gloria</i> imputeth <i>bonaness</i> <i>nanti</i> works,
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackling</i>, <i>fabed</i> are they whose <i>cods</i> are forgiven, and whose <i>kertervers</i> are covered.
    </li>
    <li><i>Fabed</i> is the <i>homie</i> to whom the <i>Duchess</i> will not impute <i>kertever</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Trolleth</i> this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we <i>cackle</i> that faith was reckoned to Abraham for <i>bonaness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>How was it then reckoned? when <i>she</i> was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>lalled</i> the sign of circumcision, a seal of the <i>bonaness</i> of the faith which <i>she</i> had yet being <i>cavalier</i>: that <i>she</i> might be the <i>Auntie</i> of all them that believe, though they be not <i>roundhead</i>; that <i>bonaness</i> might be imputed unto them also:
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Auntie</i> of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also <i>mince</i> in the steps of that faith of our <i>Auntie</i> Abraham, which <i>she</i> had being yet <i>cavalier</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For the promise, that <i>she</i> should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to <i>her</i> <i>maria</i>, through the law, but through the <i>bonaness</i> of faith.
    </li>
    <li>For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:
    </li>
    <li>Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by <i>gracie</i>; to the end the promise might be sure to all the <i>maria</i>; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the <i>Auntie</i> of us all,
    </li>
    <li>(As it is <i>screeved</i>, I have made thee a <i>Auntie</i> of many nations,) before <i>her</i> whom <i>she</i> believed, even <i>Gloria</i>, who quickeneth the <i>stiff</i>, and <i>screecheth</i> those <i>fakements</i> which be not as though they were.
    </li>
    <li>Who against hope believed in hope, that <i>she</i> might become the <i>Auntie</i> of many nations, according to that which was <i>cackled</i>, So shall thy <i>maria</i> be.
    </li>
    <li>And being not <i>nelly</i> in faith, <i>she</i> considered not <i>her</i> own <i>lucoddy</i> now <i>stiff</i>, when <i>she</i> was about an <i>chenter</i> years <i>badge</i>, <i>nishta</i> yet the deadness of Sarah&#8217;s womb:
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> staggered not at the promise of <i>Gloria</i> through unbelief; but was <i>butch</i> in faith, giving <i>fabeness</i> to <i>Gloria</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And being fully persuaded that, what <i>she</i> had promised, <i>she</i> was able also to perform.
    </li>
    <li>And therefore it was imputed to <i>her</i> for <i>bonaness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now it was not <i>screeved</i> for <i>her</i> sake alone, that it was imputed to <i>her</i>;
    </li>
    <li>But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on <i>her</i> that raised up <i>Josie</i> our <i>Duchess</i> from the <i>stiff</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Who was <i>laued</i> for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with <i>Gloria</i> through our <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>:
    </li>
    <li>By whom also we have access by faith into this <i>gracie</i> wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the <i>fabeness</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And not only so, but we <i>fabeness</i> in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;
    </li>
    <li>And patience, experience; and experience, hope:
    </li>
    <li>And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of <i>Gloria</i> is shed abroad in our <i>thumping cheats</i> by the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i> which is <i>parkered</i> unto us.
    </li>
    <li>For when we were yet <i>nanti</i> <i>butchness</i>, in due time <i>Crystal</i> <i>carked it</i> for the ungodly.
    </li>
    <li>For scarcely for a <i>bona</i> <i>homie</i> will <i>una</i> <i>cark it</i>: yet peradventure for a <i>bona</i> <i>homie</i> some would even dare to <i>cark it</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>Gloria</i> commendeth <i>her</i> love toward us, in that, while we were yet <i>kerterverers</i>, <i>Crystal</i> <i>carked it</i> for us.
    </li>
    <li><i>Dowry</i> more then, being now justified by <i>her</i> blood, we shall be saved from wrath through <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to <i>Gloria</i> by the <i>carking it</i> of <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>, <i>dowry</i> more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by <i>her</i> life.
    </li>
    <li>And not only so, but we also joy in <i>Gloria</i> through our <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, by whom we have now <i>lalled</i> the atonement.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore, as by <i>una</i> <i>homie</i> <i>kertever</i> entered into the world, and <i>carking it</i> by <i>kertever</i>; and so <i>carking it</i> passed upon all <i>homies</i>, for that all have <i>kertervered</i>:
    </li>
    <li>(For until the law <i>kertever</i> was in the world: but <i>kertever</i> is not imputed when there is no law.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> <i>carking it</i> reigned from Adam to <i>Maureen</i>, even over them that had not <i>kertervered</i> after the similitude of Adam&#8217;s transgression, who is the figure of <i>her</i> that was to <i>troll</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of <i>una</i> many be <i>stiff</i>, <i>dowry</i> more the <i>gracie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and the gift by <i>gracie</i>, which is by <i>una</i> <i>homie</i>, <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, hath abounded unto many.
    </li>
    <li>And not as it was by <i>una</i> that <i>kertervered</i>, so is the gift: for the judgment was by <i>una</i> to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification.
    </li>
    <li>For if by <i>una</i> <i>homie</i>&#8216;s offence <i>carking it</i> reigned by <i>una</i>; <i>dowry</i> more they which <i>lall</i> abundance of <i>gracie</i> and of the gift of <i>bonaness</i> shall reign in life by <i>una</i>, <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>. )
    </li>
    <li>Therefore as by the offence of <i>una</i> judgment <i>trolled</i> upon all <i>homies</i> to condemnation; even so by the <i>bonaness</i> of <i>una</i> the free gift <i>trolled</i> upon all <i>homies</i> unto justification of life.
    </li>
    <li>For as by <i>una</i> <i>homie</i>&#8216;s disobedience many were made <i>kerterverers</i>, so by the obedience of <i>una</i> shall many be made <i>bona</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where <i>kertever</i> abounded, <i>gracie</i> did <i>dowry</i> more abound:
    </li>
    <li>That as <i>kertever</i> hath reigned unto <i>carking it</i>, even so might <i>gracie</i> reign through <i>bonaness</i> unto eternal life by <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> our <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>What shall we <i>cackle</i> then? Shall we continue in <i>kertever</i>, that <i>gracie</i> may abound?
    </li>
    <li><i>Gloria</i> forbid. How shall we, that are <i>stiff</i> to <i>kertever</i>, live any longer therein?
    </li>
    <li>Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> were baptized into <i>her</i> <i>carking it</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Therefore we are buried with <i>her</i> by baptism into <i>carking it</i>: that like as <i>Crystal</i> was raised up from the <i>stiff</i> by the <i>fabeness</i> of the <i>Auntie</i>, even so we also should <i>mince</i> in newness of life.
    </li>
    <li>For if we have been planted together in the likeness of <i>her</i> <i>carking it</i>, we shall be also in the likeness of <i>her</i> resurrection:
    </li>
    <li>Knowing this, that our <i>badge cove</i> is crucified with <i>her</i>, that the <i>lucoddy</i> of <i>kertever</i> might be <i>battyfanged</i>, that henceforth we should not serve <i>kertever</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> that is <i>stiff</i> is freed from <i>kertever</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now if we be <i>stiff</i> with <i>Crystal</i>, we believe that we shall also live with <i>her</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Knowing that <i>Crystal</i> being raised from the <i>stiff</i> <i>carketh it</i> <i>nishta</i>; <i>carking it</i> hath <i>nishta</i> dominion over <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For in that <i>she</i> <i>carked it</i>, <i>she</i> <i>carked it</i> unto <i>kertever</i> once: but in that <i>she</i> <i>letteth</i>, <i>she</i> <i>letteth</i> unto <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be <i>stiff</i> indeed unto <i>kertever</i>, but alive unto <i>Gloria</i> through <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> our <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Let not <i>kertever</i> therefore reign in your mortal <i>lucoddy</i>, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.
    </li>
    <li><i>Nishta</i> yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto <i>kertever</i>: but yield yourselves unto <i>Gloria</i>, as those that are alive from the <i>stiff</i>, and your members as instruments of <i>bonaness</i> unto <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>kertever</i> shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under <i>gracie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>What then? shall we <i>kertever</i>, because we are not under the law, but under <i>gracie</i>? <i>Gloria</i> forbid.
    </li>
    <li>Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves <i>serving homies</i> to obey, <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i> ye are to whom ye obey; whether of <i>kertever</i> unto <i>carking it</i>, or of obedience unto <i>bonaness</i>?
    </li>
    <li>But <i>Gloria</i> be thanked, that ye were the <i>serving homies</i> of <i>kertever</i>, but ye have obeyed from the <i>thumping cheat</i> that form of doctrine which was <i>laued</i> you.
    </li>
    <li>Being then made free from <i>kertever</i>, ye became the <i>serving homies</i> of <i>bonaness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I <i>cackle</i> after the manner of <i>homies</i> because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members <i>serving homies</i> to <i>nishta sparkle</i> and to <i>codness</i> unto <i>codness</i>; even so now yield your members <i>serving homies</i> to <i>bonaness</i> unto holiness.
    </li>
    <li>For when ye were the <i>serving homies</i> of <i>kertever</i>, ye were free from <i>bonaness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>What fruit had ye then in those <i>fakements</i> whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those <i>fakements</i> is <i>carking it</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But now being made free from <i>kertever</i>, and become <i>serving homies</i> to <i>Gloria</i>, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>parkering ninty</i> of <i>kertever</i> is <i>carking it</i>; but the gift of <i>Gloria</i> is eternal life through <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> our <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Know ye not, <i>sisters</i>, (for I <i>cackle</i> to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a <i>homie</i> as long as <i>she</i> <i>letteth</i>?
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>palone</i> which hath an <i>homie affair</i> is bound by the law to her <i>homie affair</i> so long as <i>she</i> <i>letteth</i>; but if the <i>homie affair</i> be <i>stiff</i>, she is loosed from the law of her <i>homie affair</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So then if, while her <i>homie affair</i> <i>letteth</i>, she be married to another <i>homie</i>, she shall be <i>screeched</i> an adulteress: but if her <i>homie affair</i> be <i>stiff</i>, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another <i>homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore, my <i>sisters</i>, ye also are become <i>stiff</i> to the law by the <i>lucoddy</i> of <i>Crystal</i>; that ye should be married to another, even to <i>her</i> who is raised from the <i>stiff</i>, that we should <i>parker</i> forth fruit unto <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For when we were in the flesh, the motions of <i>kertervers</i>, which were by the law, did <i>acting dickey</i> in our members to <i>parker</i> forth fruit unto <i>carking it</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But now we are <i>laued</i> from the law, that being <i>stiff</i> wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of <i>Fairy</i>, and not in the oldness of the letter.
    </li>
    <li>What shall we <i>cackle</i> then? Is the law <i>kertever</i>? <i>Gloria</i> forbid. Nay, I had not known <i>kertever</i>, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had <i>cackled</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>ogle</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>kertever</i>, taking occasion by the <i>butch lav</i>, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For <i>nanti</i> the law <i>kertever</i> was <i>stiff</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For I was alive <i>nanti</i> the law once: but when the <i>butch lav</i> <i>trolled</i>, <i>kertever</i> revived, and I <i>carked it</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>butch lav</i>, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto <i>carking it</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>kertever</i>, taking occasion by the <i>butch lav</i>, <i>mogued</i> me, and by it <i>ferricadoozaed</i> me.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore the law is <i>fabulosa</i>, and the <i>butch lav</i> <i>fabulosa</i>, and just, and <i>bona</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Was then that which is <i>bona</i> made <i>carking it</i> unto me? <i>Gloria</i> forbid. But <i>kertever</i>, that it might appear <i>kertever</i>, working <i>carking it</i> in me by that which is <i>bona</i>; that <i>kertever</i> by the <i>butch lav</i> might become exceeding sinful.
    </li>
    <li>For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under <i>kertever</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.
    </li>
    <li>If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is <i>bona</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now then it is <i>nishta</i> I that do it, but <i>kertever</i> that <i>letteth</i> in me.
    </li>
    <li>For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) <i>letteth</i> no <i>bona</i> <i>fakement</i>: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is <i>bona</i> I find not.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>bona</i> that I would I <i>nix</i>: but the <i>nana</i> which I would not, that I do.
    </li>
    <li>Now if I do that I would not, it is <i>nishta</i> I that do it, but <i>kertever</i> that <i>letteth</i> in me.
    </li>
    <li>I find then a law, that, when I would do <i>bona</i>, <i>nana</i> is present with me.
    </li>
    <li>For I delight in the law of <i>Gloria</i> after the inward <i>homie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>But I <i>varda</i> another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of <i>kertever</i> which is in my members.
    </li>
    <li>O wretched <i>homie</i> that I am! who shall deliver me from the <i>lucoddy</i> of this <i>carking it</i>?
    </li>
    <li>I thank <i>Gloria</i> through <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> our <i>Duchess</i>. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of <i>Gloria</i>; but with the flesh the law of <i>kertever</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i>, who <i>mince</i> not after the flesh, but after the <i>Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For the law of the <i>Fairy</i> of life in <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i> hath made me free from the law of <i>kertever</i> and <i>carking it</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For what the law could not do, in that it was <i>nelly</i> through the flesh, <i>Gloria</i> sending <i>her</i> own <i>homie chavvie</i> in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for <i>kertever</i>, condemned <i>kertever</i> in the flesh:
    </li>
    <li>That the <i>bonaness</i> of the law might be fulfilled in us, who <i>mince</i> not after the flesh, but after the <i>Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For they that are after the flesh do mind the <i>fakements</i> of the flesh; but they that are after the <i>Fairy</i> the <i>fakements</i> of the <i>Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For to be carnally minded is <i>carking it</i>; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.
    </li>
    <li>Because the carnal mind is enmity against <i>Gloria</i>: for it is not subject to the law of <i>Gloria</i>, <i>nishta</i> indeed can be.
    </li>
    <li>So then they that are in the flesh cannot please <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But ye are not in the flesh, but in the <i>Fairy</i>, if so be that the <i>Fairy</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>lett</i> in you. Now if any <i>homie</i> have not the <i>Fairy</i> of <i>Crystal</i>, <i>she</i> is none of <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And if <i>Crystal</i> be in you, the <i>lucoddy</i> is <i>stiff</i> because of <i>kertever</i>; but the <i>Fairy</i> is life because of <i>bonaness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But if the <i>Fairy</i> of <i>her</i> that raised up <i>Josie</i> from the <i>stiff</i> <i>lett</i> in you, <i>she</i> that raised up <i>Crystal</i> from the <i>stiff</i> shall also quicken your mortal bodies by <i>her</i> <i>Fairy</i> that <i>letteth</i> in you.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore, <i>sisters</i>, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.
    </li>
    <li>For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall <i>cark it</i>: but if ye through the <i>Fairy</i> do mortify the deeds of the <i>lucoddy</i>, ye shall live.
    </li>
    <li>For as many as are led by the <i>Fairy</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, they are the <i>homie chavvies</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For ye have not <i>lalled</i> the <i>Fairy</i> of bondage again to fear; but ye have <i>lalled</i> the <i>Fairy</i> of adoption, whereby we <i>screech</i>, Abba, <i>Auntie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Fairy</i> itself beareth <i>varda-ing fakement</i> with our <i>Fairy</i>, that we are the <i>chavvies</i> of <i>Gloria</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And if <i>chavvies</i>, then heirs; heirs of <i>Gloria</i>, and joint-heirs with <i>Crystal</i>; if so be that we suffer with <i>her</i>, that we may be also glorified together.
    </li>
    <li>For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not <i>bona</i> to be compared with the <i>fabeness</i> which shall be revealed in us.
    </li>
    <li>For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For the creature was made subject to <i>spangly</i>, not willingly, but by reason of <i>her</i> who hath subjected the same in hope,
    </li>
    <li>Because the creature itself also shall be <i>laued</i> from the bondage of corruption into the <i>fabe</i> liberty of the <i>chavvies</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.
    </li>
    <li>And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the <i>Fairy</i>, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our <i>lucoddy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For we are saved by hope: but hope that is <i>vardad</i> is not hope: for what a <i>homie</i> <i>vardaeth</i>, why doth <i>she</i> yet hope for?
    </li>
    <li>But if we hope for that we <i>varda</i> not, then do we with patience wait for it.
    </li>
    <li>Likewise the <i>Fairy</i> also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the <i>Fairy</i> itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> that searcheth the <i>thumping cheats</i> knoweth what is the mind of the <i>Fairy</i>, because <i>she</i> maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And we know that all <i>fakements</i> <i>acting dickey</i> together for <i>bona</i> to them that love <i>Gloria</i>, to them who are the <i>screeched</i> according to <i>her</i> purpose.
    </li>
    <li>For whom <i>she</i> did foreknow, <i>she</i> also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>, that <i>she</i> might be the firstborn among many <i>sisters</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover whom <i>she</i> did predestinate, them <i>she</i> also <i>screeched</i>: and whom <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i>, them <i>she</i> also justified: and whom <i>she</i> justified, them <i>she</i> also glorified.
    </li>
    <li>What shall we then <i>cackle</i> to these <i>fakements</i>? If <i>Gloria</i> be for us, who can be against us?
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> that spared not <i>her</i> own <i>homie chavvie</i>, but <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> up for us all, how shall <i>she</i> not with <i>her</i> also freely <i>parker</i> us all <i>fakements</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Who shall <i>lett</i> any <i>fakement</i> to the charge of <i>Gloria</i>&#8216;s elect? It is <i>Gloria</i> that justifieth.
    </li>
    <li>Who is <i>she</i> that condemneth? It is <i>Crystal</i> that <i>carked it</i>, <i>any road up</i> rather, that is risen again, who is even at the <i>sweet martini</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, who also maketh intercession for us.
    </li>
    <li>Who shall separate us from the love of <i>Crystal</i>? shall tribulation, or distress, or <i>chivvying</i>, or <i>nix munjarlee</i>, or <i>nanti zhoosh</i>, or peril, or <i>dowry efink</i>?
    </li>
    <li>As it is <i>screeved</i>, For thy sake we are <i>ferricadozad</i> all the <i>journo</i> long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
    </li>
    <li>Nay, in all these <i>fakements</i> we are more than conquerors through <i>her</i> that loved us.
    </li>
    <li>For I am persuaded, that <i>nishta</i> <i>carking it</i>, <i>nishta</i> life, <i>nishta</i> <i>fairies</i>, <i>nishta</i> principalities, <i>nishta</i> powers, <i>nishta</i> <i>fakements</i> present, <i>nishta</i> <i>fakements</i> to <i>troll</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Nishta</i> height, <i>nishta</i> depth, <i>nishta</i> any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of <i>Gloria</i>, which is in <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i> our <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>I <i>cackle</i> the truth in <i>Crystal</i>, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me <i>varda-ing fakement</i> in the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>,
    </li>
    <li>That I have <i>dowry</i> heaviness and continual <i>sharda</i> in my <i>thumping cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For I could wish that myself were accursed from <i>Crystal</i> for my <i>sisters</i>, my kinsmen according to the flesh:
    </li>
    <li>Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the <i>fabeness</i>, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of <i>Gloria</i>, and the promises;
    </li>
    <li>Whose are the <i>aunties</i>, and of whom as concerning the flesh <i>Crystal</i> <i>trolled</i>, who is over all, <i>Gloria</i> <i>fabed</i> for ever. <i>Larlou</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Not as though the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>lelled</i> none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel:
    </li>
    <li><i>Nishta</i>, because they are the <i>maria</i> of Abraham, are they all <i>chavvies</i>: but, In Isaac shall thy <i>maria</i> be <i>screeched</i>.
    </li>
    <li>That is, They which are the <i>chavvies</i> of the flesh, these are not the <i>chavvies</i> of <i>Gloria</i>: but the <i>chavvies</i> of the promise are counted for the <i>maria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For this is the <i>lav</i> of promise, At this time will I <i>troll</i>, and Sarah shall have a <i>homie chavvie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by <i>una</i>, even by our <i>Auntie</i> Isaac;
    </li>
    <li>(For the <i>chavvies</i> being not yet born, <i>nishta</i> having done any <i>bona</i> or <i>nana</i>, that the purpose of <i>Gloria</i> according to election might stand, not of works, but of <i>her</i> that <i>screecheth</i>😉
    </li>
    <li>It was <i>cackled</i> unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.
    </li>
    <li>As it is <i>screeved</i>, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.
    </li>
    <li>What shall we <i>cackle</i> then? Is there unrighteousness with <i>Gloria</i>? <i>Gloria</i> forbid.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i> to <i>Maureen</i>, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.
    </li>
    <li>So then it is not of <i>her</i> that willeth, <i>nishta</i> of <i>her</i> that runneth, but of <i>Gloria</i> that sheweth mercy.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>glossy</i> <i>cackleth</i> unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be <i>screeched</i> throughout all the earth.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore hath <i>she</i> mercy on whom <i>she</i> will have mercy, and whom <i>she</i> will <i>she</i> hardeneth.
    </li>
    <li>Thou wilt <i>cackle</i> then unto me, Why doth <i>she</i> yet find fault? For who hath resisted <i>her</i> will?
    </li>
    <li>Nay but, O <i>homie</i>, who art thou that repliest against <i>Gloria</i>? Shall the <i>fakement</i> formed <i>cackle</i> to <i>her</i> that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?
    </li>
    <li>Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make <i>una</i> <i>fakement</i> unto honour, and another unto dishonour?
    </li>
    <li>What if <i>Gloria</i>, willing to shew <i>her</i> wrath, and to make <i>her</i> power known, endured with <i>dowry</i> longsuffering the <i>fakements</i> of wrath fitted to destruction:
    </li>
    <li>And that <i>she</i> might make known the riches of <i>her</i> <i>fabeness</i> on the <i>fakements</i> of mercy, which <i>she</i> had afore prepared unto <i>fabeness</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Even us, whom <i>she</i> hath <i>screeched</i>, not of the <i>kosher homies</i> only, but also of the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>?
    </li>
    <li>As <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i> also in Osee, I will <i>screech</i> them my <i>homies and palones</i>, which were not my <i>homies and palones</i>; and her beloved, which was not beloved.
    </li>
    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, that in the place where it was <i>cackled</i> unto them, Ye are not my <i>homies and palones</i>; there shall they be <i>screeched</i> the <i>chavvies</i> of the living <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Esaias also <i>screecheth</i> concerning Israel, Though the number of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> will finish the <i>acting dickey</i>, and cut it short in <i>bonaness</i>: because a short <i>acting dickey</i> will the <i>Duchess</i> make upon the earth.
    </li>
    <li>And as Esaias <i>cackled</i> before, Except the <i>Duchess</i> of Sabaoth had <i>dry</i> us a <i>maria</i>, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.
    </li>
    <li>What shall we <i>cackle</i> then? That the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>, which <i>trolled after</i> not after <i>bonaness</i>, have attained to <i>bonaness</i>, even the <i>bonaness</i> which is of faith.
    </li>
    <li>But Israel, which <i>trolled after</i> after the law of <i>bonaness</i>, hath not attained to the law of <i>bonaness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;
    </li>
    <li>As it is <i>screeved</i>, <i>varda</i>, I <i>lett</i> in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on <i>her</i> shall not be ashamed.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Sisters</i>, my <i>thumping cheat</i>&#8216;s <i>fancy</i> and <i>meshigener muttering</i> to <i>Gloria</i> for Israel is, that they might be saved.
    </li>
    <li>For I bear them record that they have a zeal of <i>Gloria</i>, but not according to knowledge.
    </li>
    <li>For they being ignorant of <i>Gloria</i>&#8216;s <i>bonaness</i>, and going about to establish their own <i>bonaness</i>, have not submitted themselves unto the <i>bonaness</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>Crystal</i> is the end of the law for <i>bonaness</i> to every <i>una</i> that believeth.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>Maureen</i> describeth the <i>bonaness</i> which is of the law, That the <i>homie</i> which doeth those <i>fakements</i> shall live by them.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>bonaness</i> which is of faith <i>cackleth</i> on this wise, <i>cackle</i> not in thine <i>thumping cheat</i>, Who shall <i>troll up</i> into heaven? (that is, to <i>parker</i> <i>Crystal</i> down from above:)
    </li>
    <li>Or, Who shall <i>troll down</i> into the deep? (that is, to <i>parker</i> up <i>Crystal</i> again from the <i>stiff</i>. )
    </li>
    <li>But what <i>cackleth</i> it? The <i>lav</i> is <i>ajax</i> thee, even in thy <i>screech</i>, and in thy <i>thumping cheat</i>: that is, the <i>lav</i> of faith, which we <i>cackle</i>;
    </li>
    <li>That if thou shalt <i>dish</i> with thy <i>screech</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i>, and shalt believe in thine <i>thumping cheat</i> that <i>Gloria</i> hath raised <i>her</i> from the <i>stiff</i>, thou shalt be saved.
    </li>
    <li>For with the <i>thumping cheat</i> <i>homie</i> believeth unto <i>bonaness</i>; and with the <i>screech</i> confession is made unto salvation.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>glossy</i> <i>cackleth</i>, Whosoever believeth on <i>her</i> shall not be ashamed.
    </li>
    <li>For there is no difference between the <i>kosher homie</i> and the Greek: for the same <i>Duchess</i> over all is rich unto all that <i>screech</i> upon <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For whosoever shall <i>screech</i> upon the name of the <i>Duchess</i> shall be saved.
    </li>
    <li>How then shall they <i>screech</i> on <i>her</i> in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in <i>her</i> of whom they have not <i>aunt nelled</i>? and how shall they <i>aunt nell</i> <i>nanti</i> a <i>cackling homie</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And how shall they <i>cackle</i>, except they be <i>laued</i>? as it is <i>screeved</i>, How beautiful are the <i>plates</i> of them that <i>cackle</i> the <i>gossip</i> of peace, and <i>parker</i> glad tidings of <i>bona</i> <i>fakements</i>!
    </li>
    <li>But they have not all obeyed the <i>gossip</i>. For Esaias <i>cackleth</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, who hath believed our report?
    </li>
    <li>So then faith <i>trolleth</i> by hearing, and hearing by the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But I <i>cackle</i>, Have they not <i>aunt nelled</i>? Yes verily, their sound <i>trolled</i> into all the earth, and their <i>lavs</i> unto the ends of the world.
    </li>
    <li>But I <i>cackle</i>, Did not Israel know? First <i>Maureen</i> <i>cackleth</i>, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no <i>homies and palones</i>, and by a <i>dizzy</i> nation I will <i>wild</i> you.
    </li>
    <li>But Esaias is <i>dowry</i> bold, and <i>cackleth</i>, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.
    </li>
    <li>But to Israel <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i>, All <i>journo</i> long I have stretched forth my <i>fambles</i> unto a disobedient and gainsaying <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>I <i>cackle</i> then, Hath <i>Gloria</i> cast away <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>? <i>Gloria</i> forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the <i>maria</i> of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
    </li>
    <li><i>Gloria</i> hath not cast away <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i> which <i>she</i> foreknew. Wot ye not what the <i>glossy</i> <i>cackleth</i> of Elias? how <i>she</i> maketh intercession to <i>Gloria</i> against Israel <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Duchess</i>, they have <i>ferricadozad</i> thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am <i>dry</i> alone, and they <i>charper</i> my life.
    </li>
    <li>But what <i>cackleth</i> the answer of <i>Gloria</i> unto <i>her</i>? I have reserved to myself <i>setter</i> <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i>, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.
    </li>
    <li>Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of <i>gracie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And if by <i>gracie</i>, then is it <i>nishta</i> of works: otherwise <i>gracie</i> is <i>nishta</i> <i>gracie</i>. But if it be of works, then it is <i>nishta</i> <i>gracie</i>: otherwise <i>acting dickey</i> is <i>nishta</i> <i>acting dickey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>What then? Israel hath not obtained that which <i>she</i> <i>charpereth</i> for; but the election hath obtained it, and the <i>lettie</i> were blinded.
    </li>
    <li>(According as it is <i>screeved</i>, <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>parkered</i> them the <i>Fairy</i> of slumber, <i>ogles</i> that they should not <i>varda</i>, and <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> that they should not <i>aunt nell</i>😉 unto this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> <i>cackleth</i>, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:
    </li>
    <li>Let their <i>ogles</i> be <i>munged</i>, that they may not <i>varda</i>, and bow down their back alway.
    </li>
    <li>I <i>cackle</i> then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? <i>Gloria</i> forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is <i>troll</i> unto the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>, for to provoke them to jealousy.
    </li>
    <li>Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>; how <i>dowry</i> more their fulness?
    </li>
    <li>For I <i>cackle</i> to you <i>nishta kosher homies</i>, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>, I magnify mine office:
    </li>
    <li>If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them.
    </li>
    <li>For if the <i>chucking</i> away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the <i>stiff</i>?
    </li>
    <li>For if the firstfruit be <i>fabulosa</i>, the lump is also <i>fabulosa</i>: and if the root be <i>fabulosa</i>, so are the branches.
    </li>
    <li>And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;
    </li>
    <li>Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.
    </li>
    <li>Thou wilt <i>cackle</i> then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.
    </li>
    <li>Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:
    </li>
    <li>For if <i>Gloria</i> spared not the natural branches, <i>lell</i> heed lest <i>she</i> also spare not thee.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i> therefore the goodness and severity of <i>Gloria</i>: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in <i>her</i> goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.
    </li>
    <li>And they also, if they <i>lett</i> not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for <i>Gloria</i> is able to graff them in again.
    </li>
    <li>For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a <i>bona</i> olive tree: how <i>dowry</i> more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?
    </li>
    <li>For I would not, <i>sisters</i>, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> be <i>troll</i> in.
    </li>
    <li>And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is <i>screeved</i>, There shall <i>troll</i> out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:
    </li>
    <li>For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall <i>lell</i> away their <i>kertervers</i>.
    </li>
    <li>As concerning the <i>gossip</i>, they are enemies for your sakes: but as <i>reefing</i> the election, they are beloved for the <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s sakes.
    </li>
    <li>For the gifts and calling of <i>Gloria</i> are <i>nanti</i> repentance.
    </li>
    <li>For as ye in times past have not believed <i>Gloria</i>, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:
    </li>
    <li>Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>Gloria</i> hath concluded them all in unbelief, that <i>she</i> might have mercy upon all.
    </li>
    <li>O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of <i>Gloria</i>! how unsearchable are <i>her</i> judgments, and <i>her</i> ways past finding out!
    </li>
    <li>For who hath known the mind of the <i>Duchess</i>? or who hath been <i>her</i> counsellor?
    </li>
    <li>Or who hath first <i>parkered</i> to <i>her</i>, and it shall be recompensed unto <i>her</i> again?
    </li>
    <li>For of <i>her</i>, and through <i>her</i>, and to <i>her</i>, are all <i>fakements</i>: to whom be <i>fabeness</i> for ever. <i>Larlou</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>I beseech you therefore, <i>sisters</i>, by the mercies of <i>Gloria</i>, that ye present your bodies a living <i>parker</i>, <i>fabulosa</i>, acceptable unto <i>Gloria</i>, which is your reasonable service.
    </li>
    <li>And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that <i>bona</i>, and acceptable, and <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i>, will of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For I <i>cackle</i>, through the <i>gracie</i> <i>parkered</i> unto me, to every <i>homie</i> that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than <i>she</i> ought to think; but to think <i>nishter bevvied</i>, according as <i>Gloria</i> hath dealt to every <i>homie</i> the measure of faith.
    </li>
    <li>For as we have many members in <i>una</i> <i>lucoddy</i>, and all members have not the same office:
    </li>
    <li>So we, being many, are <i>una</i> <i>lucoddy</i> in <i>Crystal</i>, and every <i>una</i> members <i>una</i> of another.
    </li>
    <li>Having then gifts differing according to the <i>gracie</i> that is <i>parkered</i> to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;
    </li>
    <li>Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or <i>she</i> that teacheth, on teaching;
    </li>
    <li>Or <i>she</i> that exhorteth, on exhortation: <i>she</i> that giveth, let <i>her</i> do it with simplicity; <i>she</i> that ruleth, with diligence; <i>she</i> that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.
    </li>
    <li>Let love be <i>nanti</i> dissimulation. Abhor that which is <i>nana</i>; cleave to that which is <i>bona</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Be kindly affectioned <i>una</i> to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring <i>una</i> another;
    </li>
    <li>Not slothful in business; fervent in <i>Fairy</i>; serving the <i>Duchess</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in <i>meshigener muttering</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Distributing to the necessity of saints; <i>parkered</i> to hospitality.
    </li>
    <li>Bless them which <i>chivvy</i> you: bless, and curse not.
    </li>
    <li>Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and <i>parnie</i> with them that <i>parnie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Be of the same mind <i>una</i> toward another. Mind not high <i>fakements</i>, but condescend to <i>homies</i> of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.
    </li>
    <li>Recompense to no <i>homie</i> <i>nana</i> for <i>nana</i>. Provide <i>fakements</i> honest in the <i>vardaing</i> of all <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>If it be possible, as <i>dowry</i> as <i>lettieth</i> in you, live peaceably with all <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Dearly beloved, <i>do the rights</i> not yourselves, but rather <i>parker</i> place unto wrath: for it is <i>screeved</i>, <i>the rights</i> is mine; I will repay, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed <i>her</i>; if <i>she</i> thirst, <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> <i>buvare</i>: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of <i>binco fakement</i> on <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Be not overcome of <i>nana</i>, but overcome <i>nana</i> with <i>bona</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 13</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Let every <i>nishta lucoddy</i> be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of <i>Gloria</i>: the powers that be are ordained of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of <i>Gloria</i>: and they that resist shall <i>lall</i> to themselves damnation.
    </li>
    <li>For rulers are not a terror to <i>bona</i> works, but to the <i>nana</i>. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is <i>bona</i>, and thou shalt have praise of the same:
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> is the minister of <i>Gloria</i> to thee for <i>bona</i>. But if thou do that which is <i>nana</i>, be afraid; for <i>she</i> beareth not the <i>dowry efink</i> in vain: for <i>she</i> is the minister of <i>Gloria</i>, a revenger to execute wrath upon <i>her</i> that doeth <i>nana</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.
    </li>
    <li>For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are <i>Gloria</i>&#8216;s ministers, attending continually upon this <i>dowry</i> <i>fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.
    </li>
    <li>Owe no <i>homie</i> any <i>fakement</i>, but to love <i>una</i> another: for <i>she</i> that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.
    </li>
    <li>For this, <i>nishta</i> commit adultery, <i>nishta</i> <i>ferricadoza</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>sharper</i>, <i>nishta</i> bear false <i>varda-ing fakement</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>ogle</i>; and if there be any other <i>butch lav</i>, it is briefly comprehended in this <i>cackling</i>, namely, Thou shalt love thy <i>homie ajax</i> as thyself.
    </li>
    <li>Love worketh no ill to <i>her</i> <i>homie ajax</i>: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.
    </li>
    <li>And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of <i>letty</i>: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>nochy</i> is far spent, the <i>journo</i> is at <i>famble</i>: let us therefore cast off the works of <i>munge</i>, and let us put on the armour of <i>sparkle</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Let us <i>mince</i> honestly, as in the <i>journo</i>; not in rioting and <i>daffiness</i>, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.
    </li>
    <li>But put ye on the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 14</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Her</i> that is <i>nelly</i> in the faith <i>lall</i> ye, but not to doubtful disputations.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>una</i> believeth that <i>she</i> may <i>jarry</i> all <i>fakements</i>: another, who is <i>nelly</i>, eateth herbs.
    </li>
    <li>Let not <i>her</i> that eateth despise <i>her</i> that eateth not; and let not <i>her</i> which eateth not <i>beak</i> <i>her</i> that eateth: for <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>lalled</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Who art thou that judgest another <i>homie</i>&#8216;s <i>serving homie</i>? to <i>her</i> own master <i>she</i> standeth or falleth. <i>Any road up</i>, <i>she</i> shall be holden up: for <i>Gloria</i> is able to make <i>her</i> stand.
    </li>
    <li><i>Una</i> <i>homie</i> esteemeth <i>una</i> <i>journo</i> above another: another esteemeth every <i>journo</i> alike. Let every <i>homie</i> be fully persuaded in <i>her</i> own mind.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> that regardeth the <i>journo</i>, regardeth it unto the <i>Duchess</i>; and <i>she</i> that regardeth not the <i>journo</i>, to the <i>Duchess</i> <i>she</i> doth not regard it. <i>She</i> that eateth, eateth to the <i>Duchess</i>, for <i>she</i> giveth <i>Gloria</i> thanks; and <i>she</i> that eateth not, to the <i>Duchess</i> <i>she</i> eateth not, and giveth <i>Gloria</i> thanks.
    </li>
    <li>For none of us <i>letteth</i> to himself, and no <i>homie</i> <i>carketh it</i> to himself.
    </li>
    <li>For whether we live, we live unto the <i>Duchess</i>; and whether we <i>cark it</i>, we <i>cark it</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>: whether we live therefore, or <i>cark it</i>, we are the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s.
    </li>
    <li>For to this end <i>Crystal</i> both <i>carked it</i>, and rose, and revived, that <i>she</i> might be <i>Duchess</i> both of the <i>stiff</i> and living.
    </li>
    <li>But why dost thou <i>beak</i> thy <i>sister</i>? or why dost thou set at nought thy <i>sister</i>? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For it is <i>screeved</i>, As I live, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, every knee shall bow to me, and every <i>polari</i> shall <i>dish</i> to <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So then every <i>una</i> of us shall <i>parker</i> account of himself to <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Let us not therefore <i>beak</i> <i>una</i> another any more: but <i>beak</i> this rather, that no <i>homie</i> put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in <i>her</i> <i>sister</i>&#8216;s way.
    </li>
    <li>I know, and am persuaded by the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i>, that there is <i>nishter</i> <i>nanti sparkle</i> of itself: but to <i>her</i> that esteemeth any <i>fakement</i> to be <i>nanti sparkle</i>, to <i>her</i> it is <i>nanti sparkle</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But if thy <i>sister</i> be grieved with thy <i>carnish</i>, now walkest thou not charitably. <i>Battyfang</i> not <i>her</i> with thy <i>carnish</i>, for whom <i>Crystal</i> <i>carked it</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Let not then your <i>bona</i> be <i>nana</i> <i>cackled</i> of:
    </li>
    <li>For the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i> is not <i>carnish</i> and <i>buvare</i>; but <i>bonaness</i>, and peace, and joy in the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> that in these <i>fakements</i> serveth <i>Crystal</i> is acceptable to <i>Gloria</i>, and approved of <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Let us therefore <i>troll after</i> after the <i>fakements</i> which make for peace, and <i>fakements</i> wherewith <i>una</i> may edify another.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>carnish</i> <i>battyfang</i> not the <i>acting dickey</i> of <i>Gloria</i>. All <i>fakements</i> indeed are pure; but it is <i>nana</i> for that <i>homie</i> who eateth with offence.
    </li>
    <li>It is <i>bona</i> <i>nishta</i> to <i>jarry</i> flesh, <i>nishta</i> to <i>buvare</i> <i>sherry</i>, <i>nishta</i> any <i>fakement</i> whereby thy <i>sister</i> stumbleth, or is offended, or is made <i>nelly</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before <i>Gloria</i>. Happy is <i>she</i> that condemneth not himself in that <i>fakement</i> which <i>she</i> alloweth.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> that doubteth is damned if <i>she</i> <i>jarry</i>, because <i>she</i> eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is <i>kertever</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 15</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>We then that are <i>butch</i> ought to bear the infirmities of the <i>nelly</i>, and not to please ourselves.
    </li>
    <li>Let every <i>una</i> of us please <i>her</i> <i>homie ajax</i> for <i>her</i> <i>bona</i> to edification.
    </li>
    <li>For even <i>Crystal</i> pleased not himself; but, as it is <i>screeved</i>, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.
    </li>
    <li>For whatsoever <i>fakements</i> were <i>screeved</i> aforetime were <i>screeved</i> for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the <i>glossies</i> might have hope.
    </li>
    <li>Now the <i>Gloria</i> of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded <i>una</i> toward another according to <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>That ye may with <i>una</i> mind and <i>una</i> <i>screech</i> glorify <i>Gloria</i>, even the <i>Auntie</i> of our <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore <i>lall</i> ye <i>una</i> another, as <i>Crystal</i> also <i>lalled</i> us to the <i>fabeness</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now I <i>cackle</i> that <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of <i>Gloria</i>, to confirm the promises made unto the <i>aunties</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And that the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> might glorify <i>Gloria</i> for <i>her</i> mercy; as it is <i>screeved</i>, For this cause I will <i>dish</i> to thee among the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>, and sing unto thy name.
    </li>
    <li>And again <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i>, Rejoice, ye <i>nishta kosher homies</i>, with <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And again, Praise the <i>Duchess</i>, all ye <i>nishta kosher homies</i>; and laud <i>her</i>, all ye <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And again, Esaias <i>cackleth</i>, There shall be a root of Jesse, and <i>she</i> that shall rise to reign over the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>; in <i>her</i> shall the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> trust.
    </li>
    <li>Now the <i>Gloria</i> of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And I myself also am persuaded of you, my <i>sisters</i>, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish <i>una</i> another.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, <i>sisters</i>, I have <i>screeved</i> the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the <i>gracie</i> that is <i>parkered</i> to me of <i>Gloria</i>,
    </li>
    <li>That I should be the minister of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> to the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>, ministering the <i>gossip</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, that the <i>parkering</i> up of the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> might be acceptable, being sanctified by the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I have therefore whereof I may <i>fabeness</i> through <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> in those <i>fakements</i> which pertain to <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For I will not dare to <i>cackle</i> of any of those <i>fakements</i> which <i>Crystal</i> hath not wrought by me, to make the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> obedient, by <i>lav</i> and deed,
    </li>
    <li>Through <i>dowry butch</i> signs and wonders, by the power of the <i>Fairy</i> of <i>Gloria</i>; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully <i>cackled</i> the <i>gossip</i> of <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, so have I strived to <i>cackle</i> the <i>gossip</i>, not where <i>Crystal</i> was named, lest I should build upon another <i>homie</i>&#8216;s foundation:
    </li>
    <li>But as it is <i>screeved</i>, To whom <i>she</i> was not <i>cackled</i> of, they shall <i>varda</i>: and they that have not <i>aunt nelled</i> shall understand.
    </li>
    <li>For which cause also I have been <i>dowry</i> hindered from <i>trolling</i> to you.
    </li>
    <li>But now having <i>nishta</i> place in these parts, and having a <i>dowry</i> <i>fancy</i> these many years to <i>troll</i> unto you;
    </li>
    <li>Whensoever I <i>lell</i> my journey into Spain, I will <i>troll</i> to you: for I trust to <i>varda</i> you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company.
    </li>
    <li>But now I <i>troll</i> unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.
    </li>
    <li>For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the <i>nanti dinarly</i> saints which are at Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> have been made partakers of their spiritual <i>fakements</i>, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will <i>troll</i> by you into Spain.
    </li>
    <li>And I am sure that, when I <i>troll</i> unto you, I shall <i>troll</i> in the fulness of the <i>bona lav</i> of the <i>gossip</i> of <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now I beseech you, <i>sisters</i>, for the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>&#8216;s sake, and for the love of the <i>Fairy</i>, that ye strive together with me in your <i>meshigener mutterings</i> to <i>Gloria</i> for me;

    <li>That I may be <i>laued</i> from them that <i>nix</i> believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;
    </li>
    <li>That I may <i>troll</i> unto you with joy by the will of <i>Gloria</i>, and may with you be refreshed.
