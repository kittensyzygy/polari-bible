    <h1>Luke</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Forasmuch as many have <i>lelled</i> in <i>famble</i> to set forth in order a declaration of those <i>fakements</i> which are most surely believed among us,
    </li>
    <li>Even as they <i>laued</i> them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the <i>lav</i>;
    </li>
    <li>It seemed <i>bona</i> to me also, having had <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i> understanding of all <i>fakements</i> from the <i>dowry</i> first, to <i>screeve</i> unto thee in order, most <i>fantabulosa</i> Theophilus,
    </li>
    <li>That thou mightest know the certainty of those <i>fakements</i>, wherein thou hast been instructed.
    </li>
    <li>THERE was in the days of Herod, the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judaea, a certain <i>godly homie</i> named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i> was of the <i>palone chavvies</i> of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.
    </li>
    <li>And they were both <i>bona</i> before <i>Gloria</i>, <i>mincing</i> in all the <i>butch lavs</i> and ordinances of the <i>Duchess</i> blameless.
    </li>
    <li>And they had no <i>chavvie</i>, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well stricken in years.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, that while <i>she</i> executed the <i>godly homie</i>&#8216;s office before <i>Gloria</i> in the order of <i>her</i> course,
    </li>
    <li>According to the custom of the <i>godly homie</i>&#8216;s office, <i>her</i> lot was to burn <i>smelly</i> when <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> into the <i>holy carsey</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the whole multitude of the <i>homies and palones</i> were praying <i>nanti</i> at the time of <i>smelly</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And there appeared unto <i>her</i> an <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> standing on the <i>sweet</i> side of the <i>grovelling fakement</i> of <i>smelly</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when Zacharias <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> was troubled, and fear fell upon <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>fairy</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy <i>meshigener muttering</i> is <i>aunt nelled</i>; and thy <i>palone affair</i> Elisabeth shall bear thee a <i>homie chavvie</i>, and thou shalt <i>screech</i> <i>her</i> name <i>Jane</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at <i>her</i> birth.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> shall be <i>dowry</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and shall <i>buvare</i> <i>nishta</i> <i>sherry</i> <i>nishta</i> <i>butch</i> <i>buvare</i>; and <i>she</i> shall be filled with the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>, even from <i>her</i> mother&#8217;s womb.
    </li>
    <li>And many of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel shall <i>she</i> turn to the <i>Duchess</i> their <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> shall <i>troll</i> before <i>her</i> in the <i>Fairy</i> and power of Elias, to turn the <i>thumping cheats</i> of the <i>aunties</i> to the <i>chavvies</i>, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a <i>homies and palones</i> prepared for the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Zacharias <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>fairy</i>, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an <i>badge cove</i>, and my <i>palone affair</i> well stricken in years.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>fairy</i> answering <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of <i>Gloria</i>; and am <i>laued</i> to <i>cackle</i> unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.
    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, thou shalt be <i>nanti polari</i>, and not able to <i>cackle</i>, until the <i>journo</i> that these <i>fakements</i> shall be performed, because thou believest not my <i>lavs</i>, which shall be fulfilled in their season.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>homies and palones</i> waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that <i>she</i> tarried so long in the <i>holy carsey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> out, <i>she</i> could not <i>cackle</i> unto them: and they perceived that <i>she</i> had <i>vardad</i> a vision in the <i>holy carsey</i>: for <i>she</i> beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, that, as soon as the days of <i>her</i> ministration were accomplished, <i>she</i> <i>trolled off</i> to <i>her</i> own <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And after those days <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i> Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself <i>chinker</i> months, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Thus hath the <i>Duchess</i> dealt with me in the days wherein <i>she</i> looked on me, to <i>lell</i> away my reproach among <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And in the <i>seyth</i> month the <i>fairy</i> Gabriel was <i>laued</i> from <i>Gloria</i> unto a <i>smoke</i> of Galilee, named Nazareth,
    </li>
    <li>To a <i>nanti charver</i> espoused to a <i>homie</i> whose name was <i>Josephine</i>, of the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Davina</i>; and the <i>nanti charver</i>&#8216;s name was Mary.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>fairy</i> <i>trolled</i> in unto her, and <i>cackled</i>, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the <i>Duchess</i> is with thee: <i>fabed</i> art thou among <i>palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when she <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i>, she was troubled at <i>her</i> <i>cackling</i>, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>fairy</i> <i>cackled</i> unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and <i>parker</i> forth a <i>homie chavvie</i>, and shalt <i>screech</i> <i>her</i> name <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> shall be <i>dowry</i>, and shall be <i>screeched</i> the <i>homie chavvie</i> of the Highest: and the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> shall <i>parker</i> unto <i>her</i> the throne of <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> <i>Davina</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> shall reign over the <i>lattie</i> of Jacob for ever; and of <i>her</i> kingdom there shall be no end.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> Mary unto the <i>fairy</i>, How shall this be, <i>vardaing</i> I know not a <i>homie</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>fairy</i> answered and <i>cackled</i> unto her, The <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i> shall <i>troll</i> upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that <i>fabulosa</i> <i>fakement</i> which shall be born of thee shall be <i>screeched</i> the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a <i>homie chavvie</i> in her <i>badgeness</i>: and this is the <i>seyth</i> month with her, who was <i>screeched</i> barren.
    </li>
    <li>For with <i>Gloria</i> <i>nishter</i> shall be impossible.
    </li>
    <li>And Mary <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i> the <i>famble palone</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>; be it unto me according to thy <i>lav</i>. And the <i>fairy</i> <i>trolled off</i> from her.
    </li>
    <li>And Mary arose in those days, and <i>trolled</i> into the hill country with haste, into a <i>smoke</i> of Juda;
    </li>
    <li>And entered into the <i>lattie</i> of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, that, when Elisabeth <i>aunt nelled</i> the salutation of Mary, the <i>chavvy</i> leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And she <i>cackled</i> out with a loud <i>cackling fakement</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>fabed</i> art thou among <i>palones</i>, and <i>fabed</i> is the fruit of thy womb.
    </li>
    <li>And whence is this to me, that the mother of my <i>Duchess</i> should <i>troll</i> to me?
    </li>
    <li>For, lo, as soon as the <i>cackling fakement</i> of thy salutation sounded in mine <i>aunt nelly cheats</i>, the <i>chavvy</i> leaped in my womb for joy.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>fabed</i> is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those <i>fakements</i> which were <i>cackled</i> her from the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Mary <i>cackled</i>, My <i>nishta lucoddy</i> doth magnify the <i>Duchess</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And my <i>Fairy</i> hath rejoiced in <i>Gloria</i> my Saviour.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> hath regarded the low estate of <i>her</i> handmaiden: for, <i>varda</i>, from henceforth all <i>chavvies</i> shall <i>screech</i> me <i>fabed</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> that is <i>dowry butch</i> hath done to me <i>dowry</i> <i>fakements</i>; and <i>fabulosa</i> is <i>her</i> name.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>her</i> mercy is on them that fear <i>her</i> from generation to generation.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> hath shewed <i>butchness</i> with <i>her</i> arm; <i>she</i> hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their <i>thumping cheats</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> hath put down the <i>dowry butch</i> from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> hath filled the hungry with <i>bona</i> <i>fakements</i>; and the rich <i>she</i> hath <i>laued</i> empty away.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> hath holpen <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i> Israel, in remembrance of <i>her</i> mercy;
    </li>
    <li>As <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> to our <i>aunties</i>, to Abraham, and to <i>her</i> <i>maria</i> for ever.
    </li>
    <li>And Mary <i>letted</i> with her about <i>trey</i> months, and <i>trolled back to</i> her own <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now Elisabeth&#8217;s full time <i>trolled</i> that she should be <i>laued</i>; and she brought forth a <i>homie chavvie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And her neighbours and her cousins <i>aunt nelled</i> how the <i>Duchess</i> had shewed <i>dowry</i> mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, that on the <i>otterth</i> <i>journo</i> they <i>trolled</i> to circumcise the <i>chavvie</i>; and they <i>screeched</i> <i>her</i> Zacharias, after the name of <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>her</i> mother answered and <i>cackled</i>, Not so; but <i>she</i> shall be <i>screeched</i> <i>Jane</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>cackled</i> unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is <i>screeched</i> by this name.
    </li>
    <li>And they made signs to <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, how <i>she</i> would have <i>her</i> <i>screeched</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> asked for a <i>screeving</i> table, and <i>screeved</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>her</i> name is <i>Jane</i>. And they marvelled all.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>her</i> <i>screech</i> was opened immediately, and <i>her</i> <i>polari</i> loosed, and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, and praised <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And fear <i>trolled</i> on all that <i>letted</i> round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.
    </li>
    <li>And all they that <i>aunt nelled</i> them <i>laued</i> them up in their <i>thumping cheats</i>, <i>cackling</i>, What manner of <i>chavvie</i> shall this be! And the <i>famble</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> was with <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> Zacharias was filled with the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>, and prophesied, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Fabed</i> be the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel; for <i>she</i> hath visited and redeemed <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And hath raised up an <i>colin</i> of salvation for us in the <i>lattie</i> of <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i> <i>Davina</i>;
    </li>
    <li>As <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> by the <i>screech</i> of <i>her</i> <i>fabulosa</i> prophets, which have been since the world began:
    </li>
    <li>That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the <i>famble</i> of all that hate us;
    </li>
    <li>To perform the mercy promised to our <i>aunties</i>, and to remember <i>her</i> <i>fabulosa</i> covenant;
    </li>
    <li>The oath which <i>she</i> sware to our <i>Auntie</i> Abraham,
    </li>
    <li>That <i>she</i> would grant unto us, that we being <i>laued</i> out of the <i>famble</i> of our enemies might serve <i>her</i> <i>nanti</i> fear,
    </li>
    <li>In holiness and <i>bonaness</i> before <i>her</i>, all the days of our life.
    </li>
    <li>And thou, <i>chavvie</i>, shalt be <i>screeched</i> the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt <i>troll</i> before the <i>eke</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> to prepare <i>her</i> ways;
    </li>
    <li>To <i>parker</i> knowledge of salvation unto <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i> by the remission of their <i>kertervers</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Through the tender mercy of our <i>Gloria</i>; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us,
    </li>
    <li>To <i>parker</i> <i>sparkle</i> to them that <i>lett</i> in <i>munge</i> and in the shadow of <i>carking it</i>, to guide our <i>plates</i> into the way of peace.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>chavvie</i> grew, and waxed <i>butch</i> in <i>Fairy</i>, and was in the deserts till the <i>journo</i> of <i>her</i> shewing unto Israel.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> in those days, that there <i>trolled</i> out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.
    </li>
    <li>(And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria. )
    </li>
    <li>And all <i>trolled</i> to be taxed, every <i>una</i> into <i>her</i> own <i>smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josephine</i> also <i>trolled</i> up from Galilee, out of the <i>smoke</i> of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i>, which is <i>screeched</i> Bethlehem; (because <i>she</i> was of the <i>lattie</i> and lineage of <i>Davina</i>🙂
    </li>
    <li>To be taxed with Mary <i>her</i> espoused <i>palone affair</i>, being <i>dowry</i> <i>up the duff</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be <i>laued</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And she brought forth her firstborn <i>homie chavvie</i>, and wrapped <i>her</i> in swaddling <i>zhoosh</i>, and <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.
    </li>
    <li>And there were in the same country shepherds <i>letting</i> in the field, keeping <i>varda</i> over their flock by <i>nochy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And, lo, the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> upon them, and the <i>fabeness</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>fairy</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Fear not: for, <i>varda</i>, I <i>parker</i> you <i>bona</i> tidings of <i>dowry</i> joy, which shall be to all <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For unto you is born this <i>journo</i> in the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i> a Saviour, which is <i>Crystal</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the <i>chavvy</i> wrapped in swaddling <i>zhoosh</i>, lying in a manger.
    </li>
    <li>And suddenly there was with the <i>fairy</i> a multitude of the heavenly host praising <i>Gloria</i>, and <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Fabeness</i> to <i>Gloria</i> in the highest, and on earth peace, <i>bona</i> will toward <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, as the <i>fairies</i> were <i>trolled</i> away from them into heaven, the shepherds <i>cackled</i> <i>una</i> to another, Let us now <i>troll</i> even unto Bethlehem, and <i>varda</i> this <i>fakement</i> which is <i>troll</i> to pass, which the <i>Duchess</i> hath made known unto us.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>trolled</i> with haste, and found Mary, and <i>Josephine</i>, and the <i>chavvy</i> lying in a manger.
    </li>
    <li>And when they had <i>vardad</i> it, they made known abroad the <i>cackling</i> which was <i>cackled</i> them concerning this <i>chavvie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And all they that <i>aunt nelled</i> it wondered at those <i>fakements</i> which were <i>cackled</i> them by the shepherds.
    </li>
    <li>But Mary kept all these <i>fakements</i>, and pondered them in her <i>thumping cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the shepherds <i>trolled back</i>, glorifying and praising <i>Gloria</i> for all the <i>fakements</i> that they had <i>aunt nelled</i> and <i>vardad</i>, as it was <i>cackled</i> unto them.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>say dooe</i> days were accomplished for the circumcising of the <i>chavvie</i>, <i>her</i> name was <i>screeched</i> <i>Josie</i>, which was so named of the <i>fairy</i> before <i>she</i> was conceived in the womb.
    </li>
    <li>And when the days of her purification according to the law of <i>Maureen</i> were accomplished, they brought <i>her</i> to Jerusalem, to present <i>her</i> to the <i>Duchess</i>;
    </li>
    <li>(As it is <i>screeved</i> in the law of the <i>Duchess</i>, Every <i>omee</i> that openeth the womb shall be <i>screeched</i> <i>fabulosa</i> to the <i>Duchess</i>😉
    </li>
    <li>And to offer a <i>parker</i> according to that which is <i>cackled</i> in the law of the <i>Duchess</i>, A pair of turtledoves, or <i>dewey</i> <i>bean</i> pigeons.
    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, there was a <i>homie</i> in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same <i>homie</i> was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i> was upon <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And it was revealed unto <i>her</i> by the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>, that <i>she</i> should not <i>varda</i> <i>carking it</i>, before <i>she</i> had <i>vardad</i> the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> by the <i>Fairy</i> into the <i>holy carsey</i>: and when the parents brought in the <i>chavvie</i> <i>Josie</i>, to do for <i>her</i> after the custom of the law,
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>lelled</i> <i>she</i> <i>her</i> up in <i>her</i> arms, and <i>fabed</i> <i>Gloria</i>, and <i>cackled</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Duchess</i>, now lettest thou thy <i>serving homie</i> <i>troll off</i> in peace, according to thy <i>lav</i>:
    </li>
    <li>For mine <i>ogles</i> have <i>vardad</i> thy salvation,
    </li>
    <li>Which thou hast prepared before the <i>eke</i> of all <i>homies and palones</i>;
    </li>
    <li>A <i>sparkle</i> to lighten the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>, and the <i>fabeness</i> of thy <i>homies and palones</i> Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josephine</i> and <i>her</i> mother marvelled at those <i>fakements</i> which were <i>cackled</i> of <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Simeon <i>fabed</i> them, and <i>cackled</i> unto Mary <i>her</i> mother, <i>varda</i>, this <i>chavvie</i> is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be <i>cackled</i> against;
    </li>
    <li>(<i>any road up</i>, a <i>dowry efink</i> shall pierce through thy own <i>nishta lucoddy</i> also,) that the thoughts of many <i>thumping cheats</i> may be revealed.
    </li>
    <li>And there was <i>una</i> Anna, a prophetess, the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a <i>dowry</i> age, and had lived with an <i>homie affair</i> <i>setter</i> years from her virginity;
    </li>
    <li>And she was a widow of about fourscore and <i>quarter</i> years, which <i>trolled off</i> not from the <i>holy carsey</i>, but served <i>Gloria</i> with <i>nishta manjarryings</i> and <i>meshigener mutterings</i> <i>nochy</i> and <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And she <i>trolling</i> in that instant <i>parkered</i> thanks likewise unto the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>cackled</i> of <i>her</i> to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And when they had performed all <i>fakements</i> according to the law of the <i>Duchess</i>, they <i>trolled back</i> into Galilee, to their own <i>smoke</i> Nazareth.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>chavvie</i> grew, and waxed <i>butch</i> in <i>Fairy</i>, filled with wisdom: and the <i>gracie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> was upon <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now <i>her</i> parents <i>trolled</i> to Jerusalem every year at the <i>dowry munjarlee</i> of the <i>trollover</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> was <i>kenza</i> years <i>badge</i>, they <i>trolled</i> up to Jerusalem after the custom of the <i>dowry munjarlee</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when they had fulfilled the days, as they <i>trolled back</i>, the <i>chavvie</i> <i>Josie</i> tarried behind in Jerusalem; and <i>Josephine</i> and <i>her</i> mother knew not of it.
    </li>
    <li>But they, supposing <i>her</i> to have been in the company, <i>trolled</i> a <i>journo</i>&#8216;s journey; and they sought <i>her</i> among their kinsfolk and acquaintance.
    </li>
    <li>And when they found <i>her</i> not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, that after <i>trey</i> days they found <i>her</i> in the <i>holy carsey</i>, sitting in the midst of the <i>crocuses</i>, both hearing them, and asking them questions.
    </li>
    <li>And all that <i>aunt nelled</i> <i>her</i> were <i>gobsmacked</i> at <i>her</i> understanding and answers.
    </li>
    <li>And when they <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i>, they were <i>gobsmacked</i>: and <i>her</i> mother <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>homie chavvie</i>, why hast thou thus dealt with us? <i>varda</i>, thy <i>Auntie</i> and I have sought thee sorrowing.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s business?
    </li>
    <li>And they understood not the <i>cackling</i> which <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> down with them, and <i>trolled</i> to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but <i>her</i> mother kept all these sayings in her <i>thumping cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with <i>Gloria</i> and <i>homie</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and <i>her</i> <i>sister</i> <i>Phyllis</i> tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,
    </li>
    <li>Annas and Caiaphas being the high <i>godly homies</i>, the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>trolled</i> unto <i>Jane</i> the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Zacharias in the <i>nishta smoke</i>.

    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> into all the country about Jordan, <i>cackling</i> the baptism of repentance for the remission of <i>kertervers</i>;

    <li>As it is <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the <i>lavs</i> of Esaias the prophet, <i>cackling</i>, The <i>cackling fakement</i> of <i>una</i> <i>screeching</i> in the <i>nishta smoke</i>, Prepare ye the way of the <i>Duchess</i>, make <i>her</i> paths <i>hettie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the <i>bent</i> shall be made <i>hettie</i>, and the rough ways shall be made smooth;
    </li>
    <li>And all flesh shall <i>varda</i> the salvation of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i> to the multitude that <i>trolled</i> forth to be baptized of <i>her</i>, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to <i>scarper</i> from the wrath to <i>troll</i>?
    </li>
    <li><i>Parker</i> forth therefore fruits <i>bona</i> of repentance, and begin not to <i>cackle</i> within yourselves, We have Abraham to our <i>Auntie</i>: for I <i>cackle</i> unto you, That <i>Gloria</i> is able of these stones to raise up <i>chavvies</i> unto Abraham.
    </li>
    <li>And now also the axe is <i>laued</i> unto the root of the trees: every tree therefore which <i>parkereth</i> not forth <i>bona</i> fruit is hewn down, and cast into the <i>binco fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>homies and palones</i> asked <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, What shall we do then?
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> answereth and <i>cackleth</i> unto them, <i>she</i> that hath <i>dewey</i> coats, let <i>her</i> impart to <i>her</i> that hath none; and <i>she</i> that hath <i>carnish</i>, let <i>her</i> do likewise.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>trolled</i> also <i>landladies</i> to be baptized, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Master, what shall we do?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Exact <i>nishta</i> than that which is appointed you.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>butch homies</i> likewise demanded of <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, And what shall we do? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Do <i>slapping</i> to no <i>homie</i>, <i>nishta</i> accuse any falsely; and be content with your <i>parkering ninty</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And as the <i>homies and palones</i> were in expectation, and all <i>homies</i> mused in their <i>thumping cheats</i> of <i>Jane</i>, whether <i>she</i> were the <i>Crystal</i>, or not;
    </li>
    <li><i>Jane</i> answered, <i>cackling</i> unto them all, I indeed baptize you with <i>aqua</i>; but <i>una</i> mightier than I <i>trolleth</i>, the latchet of whose <i>slingbacks</i> I am not <i>bona</i> to unloose: <i>she</i> shall baptize you with the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i> and with <i>binco fakement</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Whose fan is in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>, and <i>she</i> will throughly purge <i>her</i> floor, and will gather the wheat into <i>her</i> garner; but the chaff <i>she</i> will burn with <i>binco fakement</i> unquenchable.
    </li>
    <li>And many other <i>fakements</i> in <i>her</i> exhortation <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i> unto the <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by <i>her</i> for Herodias <i>her</i> <i>sister</i> <i>Phyllis</i>&#8216;s <i>palone affair</i>, and for all the <i>nanas</i> which Herod had done,
    </li>
    <li>Added yet this above all, that <i>she</i> shut up <i>Jane</i> in <i>charpering carsey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now when all the <i>homies and palones</i> were baptized, it <i>trolled</i> to pass, that <i>Josie</i> also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i> <i>trolled down</i> in a bodily shape like a dove upon <i>her</i>, and a <i>cackling fakement</i> <i>trolled</i> from heaven, which <i>cackled</i>, Thou art my beloved <i>homie chavvie</i>; in thee I am well pleased.

    <li>And <i>Josie</i> being full of the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i> <i>trolled back</i> from Jordan, and was led by the <i>Fairy</i> into the <i>nishta smoke</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Being <i>quarter dacha</i> days tempted of the devil. And in those days <i>she</i> did <i>jarry</i> <i>nishter</i>: and when they were ended, <i>she</i> afterward hungered.
    </li>
    <li>And the devil <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, If thou be the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, command this stone that it be made <i>pannan</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> answered <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, It is <i>screeved</i>, That <i>homie</i> shall not live by <i>pannan</i> alone, but by every <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the devil, taking <i>her</i> up into an high mountain, shewed unto <i>her</i> all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
    </li>
    <li>And the devil <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, All this power will I <i>parker</i> thee, and the <i>fabeness</i> of them: for that is <i>laued</i> unto me; and to whomsoever I will I <i>parker</i> it.
    </li>
    <li>If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> answered and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>Get her</i>: for it is <i>screeved</i>, Thou shalt worship the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i>, and <i>her</i> only shalt thou serve.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> brought <i>her</i> to Jerusalem, and set <i>her</i> on a pinnacle of the <i>holy carsey</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, If thou be the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, cast thyself down from hence:
    </li>
    <li>For it is <i>screeved</i>, <i>she</i> shall <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> <i>fairies</i> charge over thee, to keep thee:

    <li>And in their <i>fambles</i> they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy <i>plate</i> against a stone.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> answering <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, It is <i>cackled</i>, <i>nishta</i> tempt the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when the devil had ended all the temptation, <i>she</i> <i>trolled off</i> from <i>her</i> for a season.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> <i>trolled back</i> in the power of the <i>Fairy</i> into Galilee: and there <i>trolled</i> out a fame of <i>her</i> through all the region round about.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> to Nazareth, where <i>she</i> had been brought up: and, as <i>her</i> custom was, <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> into the synagogue on the sabbath <i>journo</i>, and stood up for to <i>varda the lavs</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And there was <i>laued</i> unto <i>her</i> the <i>glossy</i> of the prophet Esaias. And when <i>she</i> had opened the <i>glossy</i>, <i>she</i> found the place where it was <i>screeved</i>,
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> is upon me, because <i>she</i> hath anointed me to <i>cackle</i> the <i>gossip</i> to the <i>nanti dinarly</i>; <i>she</i> hath <i>laued</i> me to heal the brokenhearted, to <i>cackle</i> deliverance to the captives, and recovering of <i>vardaing</i> to the <i>nanti varda</i>, to set at liberty them that are bruised,
    </li>
    <li>To <i>cackle</i> the acceptable year of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> closed the <i>glossy</i>, and <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> it again to the minister, and sat down. And the <i>ogles</i> of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> began to <i>cackle</i> unto them, This <i>journo</i> is this <i>glossy</i> fulfilled in your <i>aunt nelly cheats</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And all bare <i>her</i> <i>varda-ing fakement</i>, and wondered at the <i>bona</i> <i>lavs</i> which proceeded out of <i>her</i> <i>screech</i>. And they <i>cackled</i>, Is not this <i>Josephine</i>&#8216;s <i>homie chavvie</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Ye will surely <i>cackle</i> unto me this proverb, <i>crocus</i>, heal thyself: whatsoever we have <i>aunt nelled</i> done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Verily I <i>cackle</i> unto you, No prophet is accepted in <i>her</i> own country.
    </li>
    <li>But I <i>cackle</i> you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up <i>trey</i> years and <i>sey</i> months, when <i>dowry</i> <i>nix munjarlee</i> was throughout all the land;
    </li>
    <li>But unto none of them was Elias <i>laued</i>, save unto Sarepta, a <i>smoke</i> of Sidon, unto a <i>palone</i> that was a widow.
    </li>
    <li>And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian.
    </li>
    <li>And all they in the synagogue, when they <i>aunt nelled</i> these <i>fakements</i>, were filled with wrath,
    </li>
    <li>And rose up, and thrust <i>her</i> out of the <i>smoke</i>, and led <i>her</i> unto the brow of the hill whereon their <i>smoke</i> was built, that they might cast <i>her</i> down headlong.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> passing through the midst of them <i>trolled</i> <i>her</i> way,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>trolled</i> down to Capernaum, a <i>smoke</i> of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days.
    </li>
    <li>And they were <i>gobsmacked</i> at <i>her</i> doctrine: for <i>her</i> <i>lav</i> was with power.
    </li>
    <li>And in the synagogue there was a <i>homie</i>, which had a <i>Fairy</i> of an <i>nanti sparkle</i> devil, and <i>screeched</i> out with a loud <i>cackling fakement</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackling</i>, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou <i>Josie</i> of Nazareth? art thou <i>troll</i> to <i>battyfang</i> us? I know thee who thou art; the <i>fabulosa</i> <i>una</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> rebuked <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Hold thy peace, and <i>troll</i> out of <i>her</i>. And when the devil had thrown <i>her</i> in the midst, <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> out of <i>her</i>, and hurt <i>her</i> not.
    </li>
    <li>And they were all <i>gobsmacked</i>, and <i>cackled</i> among themselves, <i>cackling</i>, What a <i>lav</i> is this! for with authority and power <i>she</i> commandeth the <i>nanti sparkle</i> <i>fairies</i>, and they <i>troll</i> out.
    </li>
    <li>And the fame of <i>her</i> <i>trolled</i> out into every place of the country round about.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> arose out of the synagogue, and entered into <i>Simone</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>. And <i>Simone</i>&#8216;s <i>palone affair</i>&#8216;s mother was <i>lelled</i> with a <i>dowry</i> fever; and they besought <i>her</i> for her.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it <i>dry</i> her: and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.
    </li>
    <li>Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto <i>her</i>; and <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i> on every <i>una</i> of them, and healed them.
    </li>
    <li>And devils also <i>trolled</i> out of many, <i>screeching</i> out, and <i>cackling</i>, Thou art <i>Crystal</i> the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>. And <i>she</i> rebuking them suffered them not to <i>cackle</i>: for they knew that <i>she</i> was <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when it was <i>journo</i>, <i>she</i> <i>trolled off</i> and <i>trolled</i> into a desert place: and the <i>homies and palones</i> sought <i>her</i>, and <i>trolled</i> unto <i>her</i>, and stayed <i>her</i>, that <i>she</i> should not <i>troll off</i> from them.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, I must <i>cackle</i> the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i> to other <i>smokes</i> also: for therefore am I <i>laued</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> in the synagogues of Galilee.

    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, that, as the <i>homies and palones</i> pressed upon <i>her</i> to <i>aunt nell</i> the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, <i>she</i> stood by the lake of Gennesaret,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>vardad</i> <i>dewey</i> <i>latties on water</i> standing by the lake: but the <i>sea queens</i> were <i>trolled</i> out of them, and were washing their nets.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> entered into <i>una</i> of the <i>latties on water</i>, which was <i>Simone</i>&#8216;s, and prayed <i>her</i> that <i>she</i> would thrust out a <i>bijou</i> from the land. And <i>she</i> sat down, and taught the <i>homies and palones</i> out of the <i>lattie on water</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now when <i>she</i> had <i>dry</i> speaking, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Simone</i>, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Simone</i> answering <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Master, we have toiled all the <i>nochy</i>, and have <i>lelled</i> <i>nishter</i>: <i>any road up</i> at thy <i>lav</i> I will let down the net.
    </li>
    <li>And when they had this done, they inclosed a <i>dowry</i> multitude of fishes: and their net brake.
    </li>
    <li>And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other <i>lattie on water</i>, that they should <i>troll</i> and help them. And they <i>trolled</i>, and filled both the <i>latties on water</i>, so that they began to sink.
    </li>
    <li>When <i>Simone</i> <i>Petra</i> <i>vardad</i> it, <i>she</i> fell down at <i>Josie</i>&#8216; knees, <i>cackling</i>, <i>sling yer hook</i>; for I am a sinful <i>homie</i>, O <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> was <i>gobsmacked</i>, and all that were with <i>her</i>, at the draught of the fishes which they had <i>lelled</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And so was also James, and <i>Jane</i>, the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Zebedee, which were partners with <i>Simone</i>. And <i>Josie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Simone</i>, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when they had brought their <i>latties on water</i> to land, they forsook all, and <i>trolled after</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when <i>she</i> was in a certain <i>smoke</i>, <i>varda</i> a <i>homie</i> full of leprosy: who <i>vardaing</i> <i>Josie</i> fell on <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>, and besought <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> put forth <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>, and <i>reefed</i> <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, I will: be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy <i>trolled off</i> from <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> charged <i>her</i> to <i>cackle</i> no <i>homie</i>: but <i>troll</i>, and shew thyself to the <i>godly homie</i>, and offer for thy cleansing, according as <i>Maureen</i> commanded, for a testimony unto them.
    </li>
    <li>But so <i>dowry</i> the more <i>trolled</i> there a fame abroad of <i>her</i>: and <i>dowry</i> multitudes <i>trolled</i> together to <i>aunt nell</i>, and to be healed by <i>her</i> of their infirmities.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> withdrew himself into the <i>nishta smoke</i>, and prayed.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> on a certain <i>journo</i>, as <i>she</i> was teaching, that there were <i>lily laws</i> and <i>crocuses</i> of the law sitting by, which were <i>troll</i> out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the <i>Duchess</i> was present to heal them.
    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, <i>homies</i> brought in a bed a <i>homie</i> which was <i>lelled</i> with a palsy: and they sought means to <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> in, and to <i>lett</i> <i>her</i> before <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when they could not find by what way they might <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> in because of the multitude, they <i>trolled</i> upon the housetop, and let <i>her</i> down through the tiling with <i>her</i> couch into the midst before <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> their faith, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>homie</i>, thy <i>kertervers</i> are forgiven thee.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>betty bracelets</i> and the <i>lily laws</i> began to reason, <i>cackling</i>, Who is this which <i>cackleth</i> <i>billingsgates</i>? Who can forgive <i>kertervers</i>, but <i>Gloria</i> alone?
    </li>
    <li>But when <i>Josie</i> perceived their thoughts, <i>she</i> answering <i>cackled</i> unto them, What reason ye in your <i>thumping cheats</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Whether is easier, to <i>cackle</i>, Thy <i>kertervers</i> be forgiven thee; or to <i>cackle</i>, Rise up and <i>mince</i>?
    </li>
    <li>But that ye may know that the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> hath power upon earth to forgive <i>kertervers</i>, (<i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto the sick of the palsy,) I <i>cackle</i> unto thee, Arise, and <i>lell</i> up thy couch, and <i>troll</i> into thine <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And immediately <i>she</i> rose up before them, and <i>lelled</i> up that whereon <i>she</i> <i>lett</i>, and <i>trolled off</i> to <i>her</i> own <i>lattie</i>, glorifying <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they were all <i>gobsmacked</i>, and they glorified <i>Gloria</i>, and were filled with fear, <i>cackling</i>, We have <i>vardad</i> strange <i>fakements</i> to <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And after these <i>fakements</i> <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> forth, and <i>vardad</i> a <i>landlady</i>, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>troll after</i> me.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>dry</i> all, rose up, and <i>trolled after</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Levi made <i>her</i> a <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry munjarlee</i> in <i>her</i> own <i>lattie</i>: and there was a <i>dowry</i> company of <i>landladies</i> and of others that sat down with them.
    </li>
    <li>But their <i>betty bracelets</i> and <i>lily laws</i> murmured against <i>her</i> disciples, <i>cackling</i>, Why do ye <i>jarry</i> and <i>buvare</i> with <i>landladies</i> and <i>kerterverers</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> answering <i>cackled</i> unto them, They that are whole need not a <i>crocus</i>; but they that are sick.
    </li>
    <li>I <i>trolled</i> not to <i>screech</i> the <i>bona</i>, but <i>kerterverers</i> to repentance.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Why do the disciples of <i>Jane</i> <i>nishta manjarry</i> often, and make <i>meshigener mutterings</i>, and likewise the disciples of the <i>lily laws</i>; but thine <i>jarry</i> and <i>buvare</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Can ye make the <i>chavvies</i> of the bridechamber <i>nishta manjarry</i>, while the bridegroom is with them?
    </li>
    <li>But the days will <i>troll</i>, when the bridegroom shall be <i>lelled</i> away from them, and then shall they <i>nishta manjarry</i> in those days.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> also a parable unto them; No <i>homie</i> <i>laueth</i> a piece of a new <i>frock</i> upon an <i>badge</i>; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was <i>lelled</i> out of the new agreeth not with the <i>badge</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And no <i>homie</i> <i>laueth</i> new <i>sherry</i> into <i>badge</i> <i>schooners</i>; else the new <i>sherry</i> will burst the <i>schooners</i>, and be spilled, and the <i>schooners</i> shall perish.
    </li>
    <li>But new <i>sherry</i> must be put into new <i>schooners</i>; and both are preserved.
    </li>
    <li>No <i>homie</i> also having <i>bevvied</i> <i>badge</i> <i>sherry</i> straightway desireth new: for <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i>, The <i>badge</i> is <i>benar</i>.

    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> on the second sabbath after the first, that <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> through the corn fields; and <i>her</i> disciples plucked the <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> of corn, and did <i>jarry</i>, rubbing them in their <i>fambles</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And certain of the <i>lily laws</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> answering them <i>cackled</i>, Have ye not <i>varda the lavs</i> so <i>dowry</i> as this, what <i>Davina</i> did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were with <i>her</i>;
    </li>
    <li>How <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> into the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and did <i>lell</i> and <i>jarry</i> the shewbread, and <i>parkered</i> also to them that were with <i>her</i>; which it is not lawful to <i>jarry</i> but for the <i>godly homies</i> alone?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, That the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> is <i>Duchess</i> also of the sabbath.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> also on another sabbath, that <i>she</i> entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a <i>homie</i> whose <i>sweet martini</i> was withered.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>betty bracelets</i> and <i>lily laws</i> watched <i>her</i>, whether <i>she</i> would heal on the sabbath <i>journo</i>; that they might find an accusation against <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> knew their thoughts, and <i>cackled</i> to the <i>homie</i> which had the withered <i>famble</i>, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And <i>she</i> arose and stood forth.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> <i>Josie</i> unto them, I will ask you <i>una</i> <i>fakement</i>; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do <i>bona</i>, or to do <i>nana</i>? to save life, or to <i>battyfang</i> it?
    </li>
    <li>And looking round about upon them all, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>homie</i>, Stretch forth thy <i>famble</i>. And <i>she</i> did so: and <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> was restored whole as the other.
    </li>
    <li>And they were filled with <i>meshigener</i>; and <i>dished the dirt</i> <i>una</i> with another what they might do to <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> in those days, that <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> out into a mountain to pray, and continued all <i>nochy</i> in <i>meshigener muttering</i> to <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when it was <i>journo</i>, <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>her</i> disciples: and of them <i>she</i> chose <i>kenza</i>, whom also <i>she</i> named apostles;
    </li>
    <li><i>Simone</i>, (whom <i>she</i> also named <i>Petra</i>,) and <i>Andrea</i> <i>her</i> <i>sister</i>, James and <i>Jane</i>, <i>Phyllis</i> and Bartholomew,
    </li>
    <li><i>Matilda</i> and Thomas, James the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Alphaeus, and <i>Simone</i> <i>screeched</i> Zelotes,
    </li>
    <li>And Judas the <i>sister</i> of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of <i>her</i> disciples, and a <i>dowry</i> multitude of <i>homies and palones</i> out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which <i>trolled</i> to <i>aunt nell</i> <i>her</i>, and to be healed of their diseases;
    </li>
    <li>And they that were vexed with <i>nanti sparkle</i> <i>fairies</i>: and they were healed.
    </li>
    <li>And the whole multitude sought to <i>reef</i> <i>her</i>: for there <i>trolled</i> virtue out of <i>her</i>, and healed them all.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> lifted up <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i> on <i>her</i> disciples, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>fabed</i> be ye <i>nanti dinarly</i>: for yours is the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Fabed</i> are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. <i>Fabed</i> are ye that <i>parnie</i> now: for ye shall <i>titter</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Fabed</i> are ye, when <i>homies</i> shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as <i>nana</i>, for the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>&#8216;s sake.
    </li>
    <li>Rejoice ye in that <i>journo</i>, and leap for joy: for, <i>varda</i>, your <i>parkering</i> is <i>dowry</i> in heaven: for in the like manner did their <i>aunties</i> unto the prophets.
    </li>
    <li>But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have <i>lalled</i> your consolation.
    </li>
    <li>Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that <i>titter</i> now! for ye shall mourn and <i>parnie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Woe unto you, when all <i>homies</i> shall <i>cackle</i> well of you! for so did their <i>aunties</i> to the false prophets.
    </li>
    <li>But I <i>cackle</i> unto you which <i>aunt nell</i>, Love your enemies, do <i>bona</i> to them which hate you,
    </li>
    <li>Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you.
    </li>
    <li>And unto <i>her</i> that <i>slappeth</i> thee on the <i>una</i> cheek offer also the other; and <i>her</i> that <i>lelleth</i> away thy <i>kapello</i> forbid not to <i>lell</i> thy coat also.
    </li>
    <li><i>Parker</i> to every <i>homie</i> that asketh of thee; and of <i>her</i> that <i>lelleth</i> away thy goods ask them not again.
    </li>
    <li>And as ye would that <i>homies</i> should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.
    </li>
    <li>For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for <i>kerterverers</i> also love those that love them.
    </li>
    <li>And if ye do <i>bona</i> to them which do <i>bona</i> to you, what thank have ye? for <i>kerterverers</i> also do even the same.
    </li>
    <li>And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to <i>lall</i>, what thank have ye? for <i>kerterverers</i> also lend to <i>kerterverers</i>, to <i>lall</i> as <i>dowry</i> again.
    </li>
    <li>But love ye your enemies, and do <i>bona</i>, and lend, hoping for <i>nishter</i> again; and your <i>parkering</i> shall be <i>dowry</i>, and ye shall be the <i>chavvies</i> of the Highest: for <i>she</i> is kind unto the unthankful and to the <i>nana</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Be ye therefore merciful, as your <i>Auntie</i> also is merciful.
    </li>
    <li><i>Beak</i> not, and <i>nanti</i> be judged: condemn not, and <i>nanti</i> be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:
    </li>
    <li><i>Parker</i>, and it shall be <i>parkered</i> unto you; <i>bona</i> measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and <i>trolling</i> over, shall <i>homies</i> <i>parker</i> into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> a parable unto them, Can the <i>nanti varda</i> lead the <i>nanti varda</i>? shall they not both fall into the ditch?
    </li>
    <li>The disciple is not above <i>her</i> master: but every <i>una</i> that is <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i> shall be as <i>her</i> master.
    </li>
    <li>And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy <i>sister</i>&#8216;s <i>ogle</i>, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own <i>ogle</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Either how canst thou <i>cackle</i> to thy <i>sister</i>, <i>sister</i>, let me pull out the mote that is in thine <i>ogle</i>, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own <i>ogle</i>? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own <i>ogle</i>, and then shalt thou <i>varda</i> clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy <i>sister</i>&#8216;s <i>ogle</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For a <i>bona</i> tree <i>parkereth</i> not forth corrupt fruit; <i>nishta</i> doth a corrupt tree <i>parker</i> forth <i>bona</i> fruit.
    </li>
    <li>For every tree is known by <i>her</i> own fruit. For of thorns <i>homies</i> <i>nix</i> gather figs, <i>nishta</i> of a bramble bush gather they grapes.
    </li>
    <li>A <i>bona</i> <i>homie</i> out of the <i>bona</i> <i>gelt</i> of <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> <i>parkereth</i> forth that which is <i>bona</i>; and an <i>nana</i> <i>homie</i> out of the <i>nana</i> <i>gelt</i> of <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> <i>parkereth</i> forth that which is <i>nana</i>: for of the abundance of the <i>thumping cheat</i> <i>her</i> <i>screech</i> <i>cackleth</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And why <i>screech</i> ye me, <i>Duchess</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>nix</i> the <i>fakements</i> which I <i>cackle</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Whosoever <i>trolleth</i> to me, and <i>aunt nelleth</i> my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom <i>she</i> is like:
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> is like a <i>homie</i> which built an <i>lattie</i>, and digged deep, and <i>laued</i> the foundation on a rock: and when the <i>dowry aqua</i> arose, the stream <i>zsa zsa-ed</i> vehemently upon that <i>lattie</i>, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> that <i>aunt nelleth</i>, and doeth not, is like a <i>homie</i> that <i>nanti</i> a foundation built an <i>lattie</i> upon the earth; against which the stream did <i>zsa zsa-ed</i> vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that <i>lattie</i> was <i>dowry</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now when <i>she</i> had ended all <i>her</i> sayings in the audience of the <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>she</i> entered into Capernaum.
    </li>
    <li>And a certain centurion&#8217;s <i>serving homie</i>, who was dear unto <i>her</i>, was sick, and ready to <i>cark it</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> of <i>Josie</i>, <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> unto <i>her</i> the <i>fungi</i> of the <i>kosher homies</i>, beseeching <i>her</i> that <i>she</i> would <i>troll</i> and heal <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when they <i>trolled</i> to <i>Josie</i>, they besought <i>her</i> instantly, <i>cackling</i>, That <i>she</i> was <i>bona</i> for whom <i>she</i> should do this:
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> loveth our nation, and <i>she</i> hath built us a synagogue.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>Josie</i> <i>trolled</i> with them. And when <i>she</i> was now not <i>nishter ajax</i> the <i>lattie</i>, the centurion <i>laued</i> <i>bencoves</i> to <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, trouble not thyself: for I am not <i>bona</i> that thou shouldest enter <i>up my lattie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore <i>nishta</i> thought I myself <i>bona</i> to <i>troll</i> unto thee: but <i>cackle</i> in a <i>lav</i>, and my <i>serving homie</i> shall be healed.
    </li>
    <li>For I also am a <i>homie</i> set under authority, having under me <i>butch homies</i>, and I <i>cackle</i> unto <i>una</i>, <i>troll</i>, and <i>she</i> goeth; and to another, <i>troll</i>, and <i>she</i> <i>trolleth</i>; and to my <i>serving homie</i>, Do this, and <i>she</i> doeth it.
    </li>
    <li>When <i>Josie</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> these <i>fakements</i>, <i>she</i> marvelled at <i>her</i>, and turned <i>her</i> about, and <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>homies and palones</i> that <i>trolled after</i> <i>her</i>, I <i>cackle</i> unto you, I have not found so <i>dowry</i> faith, no, not in Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And they that were <i>laued</i>, returning to the <i>lattie</i>, found the <i>serving homie</i> whole that had been sick.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> the <i>journo</i> after, that <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> into a <i>smoke</i> <i>screeched</i> Nain; and many of <i>her</i> disciples <i>trolled</i> with <i>her</i>, and <i>dowry</i> <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now when <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> <i>ajax</i> to the gate of the <i>smoke</i>, <i>varda</i>, there was a <i>stiff</i> <i>homie</i> <i>lelled</i> out, the only <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>her</i> mother, and she was a widow: and <i>dowry</i> <i>homies and palones</i> of the <i>smoke</i> was with her.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>Duchess</i> <i>vardad</i> her, <i>she</i> had compassion on her, and <i>cackled</i> unto her, <i>parnie</i> not.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> and <i>reefed</i> the bier: and they that bare <i>her</i> stood still. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>bean cove</i>, I <i>cackle</i> unto thee, Arise.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> that was <i>stiff</i> sat up, and began to <i>cackle</i>. And <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> to <i>her</i> mother.
    </li>
    <li>And there <i>trolled</i> a fear on all: and they glorified <i>Gloria</i>, <i>cackling</i>, That a <i>dowry</i> prophet is risen up among us; and, That <i>Gloria</i> hath visited <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And this <i>gossip</i> of <i>her</i> <i>trolled</i> forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.
    </li>
    <li>And the disciples of <i>Jane</i> shewed <i>her</i> of all these <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Jane</i> calling unto <i>her</i> <i>dewey</i> of <i>her</i> disciples <i>laued</i> them to <i>Josie</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Art thou <i>she</i> that should <i>troll</i>? or <i>varda</i> we for another?
    </li>
    <li>When the <i>homies</i> were <i>troll</i> unto <i>her</i>, they <i>cackled</i>, <i>Jane</i> Baptist hath <i>laued</i> us unto thee, <i>cackling</i>, Art thou <i>she</i> that should <i>troll</i>? or <i>varda</i> we for another?
    </li>
    <li>And in that same hour <i>she</i> cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of <i>nana</i> <i>fairies</i>; and unto many that were <i>nanti varda</i> <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> <i>vardaing</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>Josie</i> answering <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>troll</i> your way, and <i>cackle</i> <i>Jane</i> what <i>fakements</i> ye have <i>vardad</i> and <i>aunt nelled</i>; how that the <i>nanti varda</i> <i>varda</i>, the <i>nanti wallop</i> <i>mince</i>, the lepers are cleansed, the <i>nanti nellyarda</i> <i>aunt nell</i>, the <i>stiff</i> are raised, to the <i>nanti dinarly</i> the <i>gossip</i> is <i>cackled</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>fabed</i> is <i>she</i>, whosoever shall not be offended in me.
    </li>
    <li>And when the messengers of <i>Jane</i> were <i>trolled off</i>, <i>she</i> began to <i>cackle</i> unto the <i>homies and palones</i> concerning <i>Jane</i>, What <i>trolled</i> ye out into the <i>nishta smoke</i> for to <i>varda</i>? A reed shaken with the wind?
    </li>
    <li>But what <i>trolled</i> ye out for to <i>varda</i>? A <i>homie</i> clothed in soft <i>clobber</i>? <i>varda</i>, they which are <i>fabely</i> apparelled, and live delicately, are in <i>dowriest homies</i>&#8216; courts.
    </li>
    <li>But what <i>trolled</i> ye out for to <i>varda</i>? A prophet? <i>any road up</i>, I <i>cackle</i> unto you, and <i>dowry</i> more than a prophet.
    </li>
    <li>This is <i>she</i>, of whom it is <i>screeved</i>, <i>varda</i>, I <i>lau</i> my messenger before thy <i>eke</i>, which shall prepare thy way before thee.
    </li>
    <li>For I <i>cackle</i> unto you, Among those that are born of <i>palones</i> there is not a <i>dowrier</i> prophet than <i>Jane</i> the Baptist: but <i>she</i> that is <i>nanti dowriest</i> in the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i> is <i>dowrier</i> than <i>she</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And all the <i>homies and palones</i> that <i>aunt nelled</i> <i>her</i>, and the <i>landladies</i>, justified <i>Gloria</i>, being baptized with the baptism of <i>Jane</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>lily laws</i> and lawyers rejected the counsel of <i>Gloria</i> against themselves, being not baptized of <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i>, Whereunto then shall I liken the <i>homies</i> of this generation? and to what are they like?
    </li>
    <li>They are like unto <i>chavvies</i> sitting in the marketplace, and calling <i>una</i> to another, and <i>cackling</i>, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not <i>parnied</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>Jane</i> the Baptist <i>trolled</i> <i>nishta</i> eating <i>pannan</i> <i>nishta</i> <i>bevvying</i> <i>sherry</i>; and ye <i>cackle</i>, <i>she</i> hath a devil.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> is <i>troll</i> eating and <i>bevvying</i>; and ye <i>cackle</i>, <i>varda</i> a gluttonous <i>homie</i>, and a winebibber, a <i>bencove</i> of <i>landladies</i> and <i>kerterverers</i>!
    </li>
    <li>But wisdom is justified of all her <i>chavvies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>una</i> of the <i>lily laws</i> <i>fancied</i> <i>her</i> that <i>she</i> would <i>jarry</i> with <i>her</i>. And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> into the <i>lily law</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, and sat down to <i>carnish</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, a <i>palone</i> in the <i>smoke</i>, which was a sinner, when she knew that <i>Josie</i> sat at <i>carnish</i> in the <i>lily law</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, brought an alabaster box of ointment,
    </li>
    <li>And stood at <i>her</i> <i>plates</i> behind <i>her</i> weeping, and began to <i>dhobie</i> <i>her</i> <i>plates</i> with tears, and did wipe them with the <i>riah</i> of her <i>eke</i>, and kissed <i>her</i> <i>plates</i>, and anointed them with the ointment.
    </li>
    <li>Now when the <i>lily law</i> which had bidden <i>her</i> <i>vardad</i> it, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> within himself, <i>cackling</i>, This <i>homie</i>, if <i>she</i> were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of <i>palone</i> this is that <i>reefeth</i> <i>her</i>: for she is a sinner.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> answering <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>Simone</i>, I have somewhat to <i>cackle</i> unto thee. And <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i>, Master, <i>cackle</i> on.
    </li>
    <li>There was a certain creditor which had <i>dewey</i> debtors: the <i>una</i> owed <i>chinker</i> <i>chenter</i> pence, and the other <i>chinker dacha</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when they had <i>nishter</i> to pay, <i>she</i> frankly forgave them both. <i>Cackle</i> me therefore, which of them will love <i>her</i> most?
    </li>
    <li><i>Simone</i> answered and <i>cackled</i>, I suppose that <i>she</i>, to whom <i>she</i> forgave most. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Thou hast rightly judged.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> turned to the <i>palone</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Simone</i>, <i>vardest</i> thou this <i>palone</i>? I entered into thine <i>lattie</i>, thou gavest me no <i>aqua</i> for my <i>plates</i>: but she hath <i>dhobied</i> my <i>plates</i> with tears, and wiped them with the <i>riah</i> of her <i>eke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thou gavest me no kiss: but this <i>palone</i> since the time I <i>trolled</i> in hath not ceased to kiss my <i>plates</i>.
    </li>
    <li>My <i>eke</i> with <i>lube</i> thou didst not anoint: but this <i>palone</i> hath anointed my <i>plates</i> with ointment.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore I <i>cackle</i> unto thee, Her <i>kertervers</i>, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved <i>dowry</i>: but to whom <i>bijou</i> is forgiven, the same loveth <i>bijou</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto her, Thy <i>kertervers</i> are forgiven.
    </li>
    <li>And they that sat at <i>carnish</i> with <i>her</i> began to <i>cackle</i> within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth <i>kertervers</i> also?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> to the <i>palone</i>, Thy faith hath saved thee; <i>sling yer hook</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> afterward, that <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> throughout every <i>smoke</i> and village, <i>cackling</i> and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>: and the <i>kenza</i> were with <i>her</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And certain <i>palones</i>, which had been healed of <i>nana</i> <i>fairies</i> and infirmities, Mary <i>screeched</i> Magdalene, out of whom <i>trolled</i> <i>setter</i> devils,
    </li>
    <li>And Joanna the <i>palone affair</i> of Chuza Herod&#8217;s steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto <i>her</i> of their substance.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>dowry</i> <i>homies and palones</i> were gathered together, and were <i>troll</i> to <i>her</i> out of every <i>smoke</i>, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> by a parable:
    </li>
    <li>A sower <i>trolled</i> out to sow <i>her</i> <i>maria</i>: and as <i>she</i> sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was <i>minced</i> down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.
    </li>
    <li>And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.
    </li>
    <li>And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.
    </li>
    <li>And other fell on <i>bona</i> ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when <i>she</i> had <i>cackled</i> these <i>fakements</i>, <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i>, <i>she</i> that hath <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> to <i>aunt nell</i>, let <i>her</i> <i>aunt nell</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>her</i> disciples asked <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, What might this parable be?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Unto you it is <i>parkered</i> to know the mysteries of the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>: but to others in parables; that <i>vardaing</i> they might not <i>varda</i>, and hearing they might not understand.
    </li>
    <li>Now the parable is this: The <i>maria</i> is the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Those by the way side are they that <i>aunt nell</i>; then <i>trolleth</i> the devil, and <i>lelleth</i> away the <i>lav</i> out of their <i>thumping cheats</i>, lest they should believe and be saved.
    </li>
    <li>They on the rock are they, which, when they <i>aunt nell</i>, <i>lall</i> the <i>lav</i> with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.
    </li>
    <li>And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have <i>aunt nelled</i>, <i>troll forth</i>, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and <i>parker</i> no fruit to perfection.
    </li>
    <li>But that on the <i>bona</i> ground are they, which in an honest and <i>bona</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>, having <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>lav</i>, keep it, and <i>parker</i> forth fruit with patience.
    </li>
    <li>No <i>homie</i>, when <i>she</i> hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a <i>fakement</i>, or <i>laueth</i> it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may <i>varda</i> the <i>sparkle</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>nishter</i> is secret, that shall not be made manifest; <i>nishta</i> any <i>fakement</i> hid, that shall not be known and <i>troll</i> abroad.
    </li>
    <li><i>Lell</i> heed therefore how ye <i>aunt nell</i>: for whosoever hath, to <i>her</i> shall be <i>parkered</i>; and whosoever hath not, from <i>her</i> shall be <i>lelled</i> even that which <i>she</i> seemeth to have.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>trolled</i> to <i>her</i> <i>her</i> mother and <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, and could not <i>troll</i> at <i>her</i> for the press.
    </li>
    <li>And it was <i>cackled</i> <i>her</i> by certain which <i>cackled</i>, Thy mother and thy <i>sisters</i> stand <i>nanti</i>, desiring to <i>varda</i> thee.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> answered and <i>cackled</i> unto them, My mother and my <i>sisters</i> are these which <i>aunt nell</i> the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and do it.
    </li>
    <li>Now it <i>trolled</i> to pass on a certain <i>journo</i>, that <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> into a <i>lattie on water</i> with <i>her</i> disciples: and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Let us <i>troll</i> over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.
    </li>
    <li>But as they sailed <i>she</i> fell asleep: and there <i>trolled</i> down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with <i>aqua</i>, and were in jeopardy.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>trolled</i> to <i>her</i>, and awoke <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Master, master, we perish. Then <i>she</i> arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the <i>aqua</i>: and they ceased, and there was a calm.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, <i>cackling</i> <i>una</i> to another, What manner of <i>homie</i> is this! for <i>she</i> commandeth even the winds and <i>aqua</i>, and they obey <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> forth to land, there met <i>her</i> out of the <i>smoke</i> a certain <i>homie</i>, which had devils long time, and ware no <i>zhoosh</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>letted</i> in any <i>lattie</i>, but in the tombs.
    </li>
    <li>When <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> <i>Josie</i>, <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> out, and fell down before <i>her</i>, and with a loud <i>cackling fakement</i> <i>cackled</i>, What have I to do with thee, <i>Josie</i>, thou <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.
    </li>
    <li>(For <i>she</i> had commanded the <i>nanti sparkle</i> <i>Fairy</i> to <i>troll</i> out of the <i>homie</i>. For oftentimes it had caught <i>her</i>: and <i>she</i> was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and <i>she</i> brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the <i>nishta smoke</i>. )
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> asked <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, What is thy name? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Legion: because many devils were entered into <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they besought <i>her</i> that <i>she</i> would not command them to <i>troll out</i> into the deep.
    </li>
    <li>And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought <i>her</i> that <i>she</i> would suffer them to enter into them. And <i>she</i> suffered them.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>trolled</i> the devils out of the <i>homie</i>, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.
    </li>
    <li>When they that fed them <i>vardad</i> what was done, they fled, and <i>trolled</i> and <i>cackled</i> it in the <i>smoke</i> and in the country.
    </li>
    <li>Then they <i>trolled</i> out to <i>varda</i> what was done; and <i>trolled</i> to <i>Josie</i>, and found the <i>homie</i>, out of whom the devils were <i>trolled off</i>, sitting at the <i>plates</i> of <i>Josie</i>, clothed, and in <i>her</i> <i>sweet</i> mind: and they were afraid.
    </li>
    <li>They also which <i>vardad</i> it <i>cackled</i> them by what means <i>she</i> that was possessed of the devils was healed.
    </li>
    <li>Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought <i>her</i> to <i>troll off</i> from them; for they were <i>lelled</i> with <i>dowry</i> fear: and <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> up into the <i>lattie on water</i>, and <i>trolled back</i> back again.
    </li>
    <li>Now the <i>homie</i> out of whom the devils were <i>trolled off</i> besought <i>her</i> that <i>she</i> might be with <i>her</i>: but <i>Josie</i> <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> away, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Troll back to</i> thine own <i>lattie</i>, and shew how <i>dowry</i> <i>fakements</i> <i>Gloria</i> hath done unto thee. And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> <i>her</i> way, and published throughout the whole <i>smoke</i> how <i>dowry</i> <i>fakements</i> <i>Josie</i> had done unto <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, that, when <i>Josie</i> was <i>trolled back</i>, the <i>homies and palones</i> gladly <i>lalled</i> <i>her</i>: for they were all waiting for <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, there <i>trolled</i> a <i>homie</i> named Jairus, and <i>she</i> was a ruler of the synagogue: and <i>she</i> fell down at <i>Josie</i>&#8216; <i>plates</i>, and besought <i>her</i> that <i>she</i> would <i>troll</i> into <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> had <i>una</i> only <i>palone chavvie</i>, about <i>kenza</i> years of age, and she <i>lett</i> a dying. But as <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> the <i>homies and palones</i> thronged <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And a <i>palone</i> having an issue of blood <i>kenza</i> years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, <i>nishta</i> could be healed of any,
    </li>
    <li><i>Trolled</i> behind <i>her</i>, and <i>reefed</i> the border of <i>her</i> <i>frock</i>: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> <i>cackled</i>, Who <i>reefed</i> me? When all denied, <i>Petra</i> and they that were with <i>her</i> <i>cackled</i>, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and <i>cackleth</i> thou, Who <i>reefed</i> me?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> <i>cackled</i>, Somebody hath <i>reefed</i> me: for I perceive that virtue is <i>trolled</i> out of me.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>palone</i> <i>vardad</i> that she was not hid, she <i>trolled</i> trembling, and falling down before <i>her</i>, she <i>screeched</i> unto <i>her</i> before all the <i>homies and palones</i> for what cause she had <i>reefed</i> <i>her</i>, and how she was healed immediately.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto her, <i>palone chavvie</i>, be of <i>bona</i> comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; <i>sling yer hook</i>.
    </li>
    <li>While <i>she</i> yet <i>cackled</i>, there <i>trolleth</i> <i>una</i> from the ruler of the synagogue&#8217;s <i>lattie</i>, <i>cackling</i> to <i>her</i>, Thy <i>palone chavvie</i> is <i>stiff</i>; trouble not the Master.
    </li>
    <li>But when <i>Josie</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> it, <i>she</i> answered <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> into the <i>lattie</i>, <i>she</i> suffered no <i>homie</i> to <i>troll</i> in, save <i>Petra</i>, and James, and <i>Jane</i>, and the <i>Auntie</i> and the mother of the maiden.
    </li>
    <li>And all <i>parnied</i>, and bewailed her: but <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>parnie</i> not; she is not <i>stiff</i>, but sleepeth.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>tittered</i> <i>her</i> to scorn, knowing that she was <i>stiff</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> put them all out, and <i>lelled</i> her by the <i>famble</i>, and <i>screeched</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Maid, arise.
    </li>
    <li>And her <i>Fairy</i> <i>trolled</i> again, and she arose straightway: and <i>she</i> commanded to <i>parker</i> her <i>carnish</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And her parents were <i>gobsmacked</i>: but <i>she</i> charged them that they should <i>cackle</i> no <i>homie</i> what was done.

    <h2>Chapter 9</h2>

    <li>Then <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> <i>her</i> <i>kenza</i> disciples together, and <i>parkered</i> them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> them to <i>cackle</i> the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>, and to heal the sick.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>lell</i> <i>nishter</i> for your journey, <i>nishta</i> staves, <i>nishta</i> scrip, <i>nishta</i> <i>pannan</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>dinarly</i>; <i>nishta</i> have <i>dewey</i> coats apiece.

    <li>And whatsoever <i>lattie</i> ye enter into, there <i>lett</i>, and thence <i>troll off</i>.

    <li>And whosoever will not <i>lall</i> you, when ye <i>troll out</i> of that <i>smoke</i>, shake off the <i>dowry</i> dust from your <i>plates</i> for a testimony against them.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>trolled off</i>, and <i>trolled</i> through the towns, <i>cackling</i> the <i>gossip</i>, and healing every where.
    </li>
    <li>Now Herod the tetrarch <i>aunt nelled</i> of all that was done by <i>her</i>: and <i>she</i> was perplexed, because that it was <i>cackled</i> of some, that <i>Jane</i> was risen from the <i>stiff</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that <i>una</i> of the <i>badge</i> prophets was risen again.
    </li>
    <li>And Herod <i>cackled</i>, <i>Jane</i> have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I <i>aunt nell</i> such <i>fakements</i>? And <i>she</i> <i>fancied</i> to <i>varda</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the apostles, when they were <i>trolled back</i>, <i>cackled</i> <i>her</i> all that they had done. And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> them, and <i>trolled</i> aside privately into a desert place belonging to the <i>smoke</i> <i>screeched</i> Bethsaida.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>homies and palones</i>, when they knew it, <i>trolled after</i> <i>her</i>: and <i>she</i> <i>lalled</i> them, and <i>cackled</i> unto them of the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>, and healed them that had need of healing.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>journo</i> began to wear away, then <i>trolled</i> the <i>kenza</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>lau</i> the multitude away, that they may <i>troll</i> into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>parker</i> ye them to <i>jarry</i>. And they <i>cackled</i>, We have <i>nishta</i> but <i>chinker</i> loaves and <i>dewey</i> fishes; except we should <i>troll</i> and buy <i>carnish</i> for all this <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For they were about <i>chinker</i> <i>mille</i> <i>homies</i>. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> to <i>her</i> disciples, Make them <i>lett</i> down by fifties in a company.
    </li>
    <li>And they did so, and made them all <i>lett</i> down.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> the <i>chinker</i> loaves and the <i>dewey</i> fishes, and looking up to heaven, <i>she</i> <i>fabed</i> them, and brake, and <i>parkered</i> to the disciples to set before the multitude.
    </li>
    <li>And they did <i>jarry</i>, and were all filled: and there was <i>lelled</i> up of fragments that remained to them <i>kenza</i> baskets.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, as <i>she</i> was alone praying, <i>her</i> disciples were with <i>her</i>: and <i>she</i> asked them, <i>cackling</i>, Whom <i>cackle</i> the <i>homies and palones</i> that I am?
    </li>
    <li>They answering <i>cackled</i>, <i>Jane</i> the Baptist; but some <i>cackle</i>, Elias; and others <i>cackle</i>, that <i>una</i> of the <i>badge</i> prophets is risen again.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, But whom <i>cackle</i> ye that I am? <i>Petra</i> answering <i>cackled</i>, The <i>Crystal</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.

    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> to them all, If any <i>homie</i> will <i>troll</i> after me, let <i>her</i> deny himself, and <i>lell</i> up <i>her</i> cross daily, and <i>troll after</i> me.
    </li>
    <li>For whosoever will save <i>her</i> life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose <i>her</i> life for my sake, the same shall save it.
    </li>
    <li>For what is a <i>homie</i> advantaged, if <i>she</i> gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?
    </li>
    <li>For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my <i>lavs</i>, of <i>her</i> shall the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> be ashamed, when <i>she</i> shall <i>troll</i> in <i>her</i> own <i>fabeness</i>, and in <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s, and of the <i>fabulosa</i> <i>fairies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But I <i>cackle</i> you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of <i>carking it</i>, till they <i>varda</i> the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> about an <i>say dooe</i> days after these sayings, <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> <i>Petra</i> and <i>Jane</i> and James, and <i>trolled</i> up into a mountain to pray.
    </li>
    <li>And as <i>she</i> prayed, the fashion of <i>her</i> countenance was altered, and <i>her</i> <i>clobber</i> was white and glistering.
    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, there talked with <i>her</i> <i>dewey</i> <i>homies</i>, which were <i>Maureen</i> and Elias:
    </li>
    <li>Who appeared in <i>fabeness</i>, and <i>cackled</i> of <i>her</i> decease which <i>she</i> should accomplish at Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>Petra</i> and they that were with <i>her</i> were heavy with <i>letty</i>: and when they were awake, they <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i> <i>fabeness</i>, and the <i>dewey</i> <i>homies</i> that stood with <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, as they <i>trolled off</i> from <i>her</i>, <i>Petra</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Josie</i>, Master, it is <i>bona</i> for us to be here: and let us make <i>trey</i> <i>bijoux tabernaclettes</i>; <i>una</i> for thee, and <i>una</i> for <i>Maureen</i>, and <i>una</i> for Elias: not knowing what <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>.
    </li>
    <li>While <i>she</i> thus <i>cackled</i>, there <i>trolled</i> a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.
    </li>
    <li>And there <i>trolled</i> a <i>cackling fakement</i> out of the cloud, <i>cackling</i>, This is my beloved <i>homie chavvie</i>: <i>aunt nell</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>cackling fakement</i> was past, <i>Josie</i> was found alone. And they kept it close, and <i>cackled</i> no <i>homie</i> in those days any of those <i>fakements</i> which they had <i>vardad</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, that on the next <i>journo</i>, when they were <i>troll</i> down from the hill, <i>dowry</i> <i>homies and palones</i> met <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, a <i>homie</i> of the company <i>screeched</i> out, <i>cackling</i>, Master, I beseech thee, <i>varda</i> upon my <i>homie chavvie</i>: for <i>she</i> is mine only <i>chavvie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And, lo, a <i>Fairy</i> <i>lelleth</i> <i>her</i>, and <i>she</i> suddenly <i>screecheth</i> out; and it teareth <i>her</i> that <i>she</i> foameth again, and bruising <i>her</i> hardly departeth from <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And I besought thy disciples to cast <i>her</i> out; and they could not.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> answering <i>cackled</i>, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? <i>parker</i> thy <i>homie chavvie</i> hither.
    </li>
    <li>And as <i>she</i> was yet a <i>trolling</i>, the devil threw <i>her</i> down, and tare <i>her</i>. And <i>Josie</i> rebuked the <i>nanti sparkle</i> <i>Fairy</i>, and healed the <i>chavvie</i>, and <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> again to <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they were all <i>gobsmacked</i> at the <i>dowry butch</i> power of <i>Gloria</i>. But while they wondered every <i>una</i> at all <i>fakements</i> which <i>Josie</i> did, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> disciples,
    </li>
    <li>Let these sayings sink down into your <i>aunt nelly cheats</i>: for the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> shall be <i>laued</i> into the <i>fambles</i> of <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But they understood not this <i>cackling</i>, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask <i>her</i> of that <i>cackling</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be <i>dowriest</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i>, perceiving the thought of their <i>thumping cheat</i>, <i>lelled</i> a <i>chavvie</i>, and set <i>her</i> by <i>her</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackled</i> unto them, Whosoever shall <i>lall</i> this <i>chavvie</i> in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall <i>lall</i> me receiveth <i>her</i> that <i>laued</i> me: for <i>she</i> that is <i>nanti dowriest</i> among you all, the same shall be <i>dowry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Jane</i> answered and <i>cackled</i>, Master, we <i>vardad</i> <i>una</i> <i>chucking</i> out devils in thy name; and we forbad <i>her</i>, because <i>she</i> followeth not with us.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Forbid <i>her</i> not: for <i>she</i> that is not against us is for us.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when the time was <i>troll</i> that <i>she</i> should be <i>lalled</i> up, <i>she</i> stedfastly set <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> to <i>troll</i> to Jerusalem,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>laued</i> messengers before <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>: and they <i>trolled</i>, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they did not <i>lall</i> <i>her</i>, because <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> was as though <i>she</i> would <i>troll</i> to Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>her</i> disciples James and <i>Jane</i> <i>vardad</i> this, they <i>cackled</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, wilt thou that we command <i>binco fakement</i> to <i>troll</i> down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> turned, and rebuked them, and <i>cackled</i>, Ye know not what manner of <i>Fairy</i> ye are of.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> is not <i>troll</i> to <i>battyfang</i> <i>homies</i>&#8216;s lives, but to save them. And they <i>trolled</i> to another village.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, that, as they <i>trolled</i> in the way, a certain <i>homie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, I will <i>troll after</i> thee whithersoever thou <i>trollest</i>.

    <li>And <i>Josie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> hath not where to <i>lett</i> <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto another, <i>troll after</i> me. But <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, suffer me first to <i>troll</i> and bury my <i>Auntie</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Josie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Let the <i>stiff</i> bury their <i>stiff</i>: but <i>troll</i> thou and <i>cackle</i> the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And another also <i>cackled</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, I will <i>troll after</i> thee; but let me first <i>troll</i> bid them farewell, which are at home at my <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, No <i>homie</i>, having put <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>.

    <li>Therefore <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i> unto them, The harvest truly is <i>dowry</i>, but the labourers are <i>nishta dowry</i>: pray ye therefore the <i>Duchess</i> of the harvest, that <i>she</i> would <i>lau</i> forth labourers into <i>her</i> harvest.

    <li>Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the <i>dowry butch</i> works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a <i>dowry</i> while ago repented, sitting in <i>nylon</i> and ashes.

    <li>But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you.

    <li>And <i>she</i> turned <i>her</i> unto <i>her</i> disciples, and <i>cackled</i> privately, <i>fabed</i> are the <i>ogles</i> which <i>varda</i> the <i>fakements</i> that ye <i>varda</i>:
    </li>
    <li>For I <i>cackle</i> you, that many prophets and <i>dowriest homies</i> have <i>fancied</i> to <i>varda</i> those <i>fakements</i> which ye <i>varda</i>, and have not <i>vardad</i> them; and to <i>aunt nell</i> those <i>fakements</i> which ye <i>aunt nell</i>, and have not <i>aunt nelled</i> them.
    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, What is <i>screeved</i> in the law? how readest thou?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> answering <i>cackled</i>, Thou shalt love the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> with all thy <i>thumping cheat</i>, and with all thy <i>nishta lucoddy</i>, and with all thy <i>butchness</i>, and with all thy mind; and thy <i>homie ajax</i> as thyself.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Thou hast answered <i>sweet</i>: this do, and thou shalt live.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i>, willing to justify himself, <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Josie</i>, And who is my <i>homie ajax</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> answering <i>cackled</i>, A certain <i>homie</i> <i>trolled</i> down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among <i>sharpering homies</i>, which stripped <i>her</i> of <i>her</i> <i>clobber</i>, and wounded <i>her</i>, and <i>trolled off</i>, leaving <i>her</i> half <i>stiff</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And by chance there <i>trolled</i> down a certain <i>godly homie</i> that way: and when <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> <i>trolled by</i> on the other side.
    </li>
    <li>And likewise a Levite, when <i>she</i> was at the place, <i>trolled</i> and looked on <i>her</i>, and <i>trolled by</i> on the other side.
    </li>
    <li>But a certain <i>dorcas</i>, as <i>she</i> journeyed, <i>trolled</i> where <i>she</i> was: and when <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> had compassion on <i>her</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>trolled</i> to <i>her</i>, and bound up <i>her</i> wounds, pouring in <i>lube</i> and <i>sherry</i>, and set <i>her</i> on <i>her</i> own beast, and brought <i>her</i> to an inn, and <i>lelled</i> care of <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And on the morrow when <i>she</i> <i>trolled off</i>, <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> out <i>dewey</i> pence, and <i>parkered</i> them to the host, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>lell</i> care of <i>her</i>; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I <i>troll</i> again, I will repay thee.
    </li>
    <li>Which now of these <i>trey</i>, thinkest thou, was <i>homie ajax</i> unto <i>her</i> that fell among the <i>sharpering homies</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>she</i> that shewed mercy on <i>her</i>. Then <i>cackled</i> <i>Josie</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>troll</i>, and do thou likewise.
    </li>
    <li>Now it <i>trolled</i> to pass, as they <i>trolled</i>, that <i>she</i> entered into a certain village: and a certain <i>palone</i> named Martha <i>lalled</i> <i>her</i> into her <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And she had a sister <i>screeched</i> Mary, which also sat at <i>Josie</i>&#8216; <i>plates</i>, and <i>aunt nelled</i> <i>her</i> <i>lav</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But Martha was cumbered about <i>dowry</i> serving, and <i>trolled</i> to <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, dost thou not care that my sister hath <i>dry</i> me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> answered and <i>cackled</i> unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many <i>fakements</i>:
    </li>
    <li>But <i>una</i> <i>fakement</i> is needful: and Mary hath chosen that <i>bona</i> part, which shall not be <i>lelled</i> away from her.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, that, as <i>she</i> was praying in a certain place, when <i>she</i> ceased, <i>una</i> of <i>her</i> disciples <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, teach us to pray, as <i>Jane</i> also taught <i>her</i> disciples.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, When ye pray, <i>cackle</i>, Our <i>Auntie</i> which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom <i>troll</i>. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.
    </li>
    <li><i>Parker</i> us <i>journo</i> by <i>journo</i> our daily <i>pannan</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And forgive us our <i>kertervers</i>; for we also forgive every <i>una</i> that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from <i>nana</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Which of you shall have a <i>bencove</i>, and shall <i>troll</i> unto <i>her</i> at midnight, and <i>cackle</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>bencove</i>, lend me <i>trey</i> loaves;
    </li>
    <li>For a <i>bencove</i> of mine in <i>her</i> journey is <i>troll</i> to me, and I have <i>nishter</i> to set before <i>her</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> from within shall answer and <i>cackle</i>, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my <i>chavvies</i> are with me in bed; I cannot rise and <i>parker</i> thee.
    </li>
    <li>I <i>cackle</i> unto you, Though <i>she</i> will not rise and <i>parker</i> <i>her</i>, because <i>she</i> is <i>her</i> <i>bencove</i>, yet because of <i>her</i> importunity <i>she</i> will rise and <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> as many as <i>she</i> needeth.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>cackle</i> unto you, Ask, and it shall be <i>parkered</i> you; <i>charper</i>, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.
    </li>
    <li>For every <i>una</i> that asketh receiveth; and <i>she</i> that <i>charpereth</i> findeth; and to <i>her</i> that knocketh it shall be opened.
    </li>
    <li>If a <i>homie chavvie</i> shall ask <i>pannan</i> of any of you that is a <i>Auntie</i>, will <i>she</i> <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> a stone? or if <i>she</i> ask a fish, will <i>she</i> for a fish <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> a serpent?
    </li>
    <li>Or if <i>she</i> shall ask an <i>cackle fart</i>, will <i>she</i> offer <i>her</i> a scorpion?
    </li>
    <li>If ye then, being <i>nana</i>, know how to <i>parker</i> <i>bona</i> gifts unto your <i>chavvies</i>: how <i>dowry</i> more shall your heavenly <i>Auntie</i> <i>parker</i> the <i>fabulosa</i> <i>Fairy</i> to them that ask <i>her</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> was <i>chucking</i> out a devil, and it was <i>nanti polari</i>. <i>Any road up</i>, when the devil was <i>trolled</i> out, the <i>nanti polari</i> <i>cackled</i>; and the <i>homies and palones</i> wondered.
    </li>
    <li>But some of them <i>cackled</i>, <i>she</i> casteth out devils through Beelzebub the <i>dowriest</i> of the devils.
    </li>
    <li>And others, tempting <i>her</i>, sought of <i>her</i> a sign from heaven.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i>, knowing their thoughts, <i>cackled</i> unto them, Every kingdom <i>medzered</i> against itself is brought to desolation; and a <i>lattie</i> <i>medzered</i> against a <i>lattie</i> falleth.
    </li>
    <li>If <i>Sadie</i> also be <i>medzered</i> against himself, how shall <i>her</i> kingdom stand? because ye <i>cackle</i> that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.
    </li>
    <li>And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your <i>homie chavvies</i> cast them out? therefore shall they be your <i>beaks</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But if I with the <i>lupper</i> of <i>Gloria</i> cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i> is <i>troll</i> upon you.
    </li>
    <li>When a <i>manly alice</i> armed keepeth <i>her</i> <i>dowry lattie</i>, <i>her</i> goods are in peace:
    </li>
    <li>But when a <i>butcher</i> than <i>she</i> shall <i>troll</i> upon <i>her</i>, and overcome <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> <i>lelleth</i> from <i>her</i> all <i>her</i> armour wherein <i>she</i> trusted, and divideth <i>her</i> spoils.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> that is not with me is against me: and <i>she</i> that gathereth not with me scattereth.
    </li>
    <li>When the <i>nanti sparkle</i> <i>Fairy</i> is <i>trolled</i> out of a <i>homie</i>, <i>she</i> <i>minceth</i> through dry places, seeking <i>lettie</i>; and finding none, <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i>, I will return unto my <i>lattie</i> whence I <i>trolled</i> out.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> <i>trolleth</i>, <i>she</i> findeth it swept and garnished.
    </li>
    <li>Then goeth <i>she</i>, and <i>lelleth</i> to <i>her</i> <i>setter</i> other <i>fairies</i> more <i>naff</i> than himself; and they enter in, and <i>lett</i> there: and the last state of that <i>homie</i> is worse than the first.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, as <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> these <i>fakements</i>, a certain <i>palone</i> of the company lifted up her <i>cackling fakement</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>fabed</i> is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>any road up</i> rather, <i>fabed</i> are they that <i>aunt nell</i> the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and keep it.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>homies and palones</i> were gathered thick together, <i>she</i> began to <i>cackle</i>, This is an <i>nana</i> generation: they <i>charper</i> a sign; and there shall no sign be <i>parkered</i> it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.
    </li>
    <li>For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> be to this generation.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>dowriest palone</i> of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the <i>homies</i> of this generation, and condemn them: for she <i>trolled</i> from the utmost parts of the earth to <i>aunt nell</i> the wisdom of Solomon; and, <i>varda</i>, a <i>dowrier</i> than Solomon is here.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>homies</i> of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the <i>cackling</i> of Jonas; and, <i>varda</i>, a <i>dowrier</i> than Jonas is here.
    </li>
    <li>No <i>homie</i>, when <i>she</i> hath lighted a candle, <i>laueth</i> it in a secret place, <i>nishta</i> under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which <i>troll</i> in may <i>varda</i> the <i>sparkle</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>sparkle</i> of the <i>lucoddy</i> is the <i>ogle</i>: therefore when thine <i>ogle</i> is single, thy whole <i>lucoddy</i> also is full of <i>sparkle</i>; but when thine <i>ogle</i> is <i>nana</i>, thy <i>lucoddy</i> also is full of <i>munge</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Lell</i> heed therefore that the <i>sparkle</i> which is in thee be not <i>munge</i>.
    </li>
    <li>If thy whole <i>lucoddy</i> therefore be full of <i>sparkle</i>, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of <i>sparkle</i>, as when the bright shining of a candle doth <i>parker</i> thee <i>sparkle</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And as <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, a certain <i>lily law</i> besought <i>her</i> to dine with <i>her</i>: and <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> in, and sat down to <i>carnish</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>lily law</i> <i>vardad</i> it, <i>she</i> marvelled that <i>she</i> had not first <i>dhobied</i> before dinner.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Now do ye <i>lily laws</i> make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and <i>naffness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Ye fools, did not <i>she</i> that made that which is <i>nanti</i> make that which is within also?
    </li>
    <li>But rather <i>parker</i> alms of such <i>fakements</i> as ye have; and, <i>varda</i>, all <i>fakements</i> are clean unto you.
    </li>
    <li>But woe unto you, <i>lily laws</i>! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and <i>troll over</i> judgment and the love of <i>Gloria</i>: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.
    </li>
    <li>Woe unto you, <i>lily laws</i>! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and <i>boyno</i> in the <i>bodegas</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Woe unto you, <i>betty bracelets</i> and <i>lily laws</i>, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the <i>homies</i> that <i>mince</i> over them are not aware of them.
    </li>
    <li>Then answered <i>una</i> of the lawyers, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Master, thus <i>cackling</i> thou reproachest us also.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade <i>homies</i> with burdens <i>naff</i> to be borne, and ye yourselves <i>reef</i> not the burdens with <i>una</i> of your <i>luppers</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your <i>aunties</i> <i>ferricadozad</i> them.
    </li>
    <li>Truly ye bear <i>varda-ing fakement</i> that ye allow the deeds of your <i>aunties</i>: for they indeed <i>ferricadozad</i> them, and ye build their sepulchres.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore also <i>cackled</i> the wisdom of <i>Gloria</i>, I will <i>lau</i> them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall <i>ferricadooza</i> and <i>chivvy</i>:
    </li>
    <li>That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;
    </li>
    <li>From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias which perished between the <i>grovelling fakement</i> and the <i>holy carsey</i>: verily I <i>cackle</i> unto you, It shall be required of this generation.
    </li>
    <li>Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have <i>lelled</i> away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.
    </li>
    <li>And as <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> these <i>fakements</i> unto them, the <i>betty bracelets</i> and the <i>lily laws</i> began to urge <i>her</i> vehemently, and to provoke <i>her</i> to <i>cackle</i> of many <i>fakements</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Laying wait for <i>her</i>, and seeking to catch something out of <i>her</i> <i>screech</i>, that they might accuse <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of <i>homies and palones</i>, insomuch that they trode <i>una</i> upon another, <i>she</i> began to <i>cackle</i> unto <i>her</i> disciples first of all, <i>gardy loo</i> ye of the leaven of the <i>lily laws</i>, which is hypocrisy.
    </li>
    <li>For there is <i>nishter</i> covered, that shall not be revealed; <i>nishta</i> hid, that shall not be known.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore whatsoever ye have <i>cackled</i> in <i>munge</i> shall be <i>aunt nelled</i> in the <i>sparkle</i>; and that which ye have <i>cackled</i> in the <i>aunt nelling cheat</i> in <i>cottages</i> shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>cackle</i> unto you my <i>bencoves</i>, Be not afraid of them that <i>ferricadoza</i> the <i>lucoddy</i>, and after that have <i>nishta</i> that they can do.
    </li>
    <li>But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear <i>her</i>, which after <i>she</i> hath <i>ferricadozad</i> hath power to cast into hell; <i>any road up</i>, I <i>cackle</i> unto you, Fear <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Are not <i>chinker</i> sparrows sold for <i>dewey</i> farthings, and not <i>una</i> of them is forgotten before <i>Gloria</i>?
    </li>
    <li>But even the <i>dowry</i> <i>riah</i> of your <i>eke</i> are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.
    </li>
    <li>Also I <i>cackle</i> unto you, Whosoever shall <i>dish</i> me before <i>homies</i>, <i>her</i> shall the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> also <i>dish</i> before the <i>fairies</i> of <i>Gloria</i>:
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> that denieth me before <i>homies</i> shall be denied before the <i>fairies</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And whosoever shall <i>cackle</i> a <i>lav</i> against the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, it shall be forgiven <i>her</i>: but unto <i>her</i> that <i>billingsgateth</i> against the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i> it shall not be forgiven.
    </li>
    <li>And when they <i>parker</i> you unto the synagogues, and unto <i>beaks</i>, and powers, <i>lell</i> ye no thought how or what <i>fakement</i> ye shall answer, or what ye shall <i>cackle</i>:
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i> shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to <i>cackle</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>una</i> of the company <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Master, <i>cackle</i> to my <i>sister</i>, that <i>she</i> divide the inheritance with me.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>homie</i>, who made me a <i>beak</i> or a divider over you?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>lell</i> heed, and <i>gardy loo</i> of <i>ogling</i>: for a <i>homie</i>&#8216;s life consisteth not in the abundance of the <i>fakements</i> which <i>she</i> possesseth.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> a parable unto them, <i>cackling</i>, The ground of a certain rich <i>homie</i> brought forth plentifully:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> thought within himself, <i>cackling</i>, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build <i>dowrier</i>; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.
    </li>
    <li>And I will <i>cackle</i> to my <i>nishta lucoddy</i>, <i>nishta lucoddy</i>, thou hast <i>dowry</i> goods <i>laued</i> up for many years; <i>lell</i> thine ease, <i>jarry</i>, <i>buvare</i>, and be merry.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Thou <i>bimbo</i>, this <i>nochy</i> thy <i>nishta lucoddy</i> shall be required of thee: then whose shall those <i>fakements</i> be, which thou hast provided?
    </li>
    <li>So is <i>she</i> that layeth up <i>gelt</i> for himself, and is not rich toward <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> disciples, Therefore I <i>cackle</i> unto you, <i>lell</i> no thought for your life, what ye shall <i>jarry</i>; <i>nishta</i> for the <i>lucoddy</i>, what ye shall put on.
    </li>
    <li>The life is more than <i>carnish</i>, and the <i>lucoddy</i> is more than <i>clobber</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Consider the ravens: for they <i>nishta</i> sow <i>nishta</i> reap; which <i>nishta</i> have storehouse <i>nishta</i> barn; and <i>Gloria</i> <i>jarrieth</i> them: how <i>dowry</i> more are ye <i>benar</i> than the fowls?
    </li>
    <li>And which of you with taking thought can add to <i>her</i> stature <i>una</i> cubit?
    </li>
    <li>If ye then be not able to do that <i>fakement</i> which is <i>nanti dowriest</i>, why <i>lell</i> ye thought for the <i>lettie</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I <i>cackle</i> unto you, that Solomon in all <i>her</i> <i>fabeness</i> was not arrayed like <i>una</i> of these.
    </li>
    <li>If then <i>Gloria</i> so clothe the grass, which is to <i>journo</i> in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how <i>dowry</i> more will <i>she</i> clothe you, O ye of <i>bijou</i> faith?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>charper</i> not ye what ye shall <i>jarry</i>, or what ye shall <i>buvare</i>, <i>nishta</i> be ye of doubtful mind.
    </li>
    <li>For all these <i>fakements</i> do the nations of the world <i>charper</i> after: and your <i>Auntie</i> knoweth that ye have need of these <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But rather <i>charper</i> ye the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>; and all these <i>fakements</i> shall be added unto you.
    </li>
    <li>Fear not, <i>bijou</i> flock; for it is your <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s <i>bona</i> pleasure to <i>parker</i> you the kingdom.
    </li>
    <li>Sell that ye have, and <i>parker</i> alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not <i>badge</i>, a <i>gelt</i> in the heavens that faileth not, where no <i>sharpering homie</i> approacheth, <i>nishta</i> moth corrupteth.
    </li>
    <li>For where your <i>gelt</i> is, there will your <i>thumping cheat</i> be also.
    </li>
    <li>Let your loins be girded about, and your <i>sparkles</i> burning;
    </li>
    <li>And ye yourselves like unto <i>homies</i> that wait for their <i>Duchess</i>, when <i>she</i> will return from the wedding; that when <i>she</i> <i>trolleth</i> and knocketh, they may open unto <i>her</i> immediately.
    </li>
    <li><i>Fabed</i> are those <i>serving homies</i>, whom the <i>Duchess</i> when <i>she</i> <i>trolleth</i> shall find watching: verily I <i>cackle</i> unto you, that <i>she</i> shall gird himself, and make them to <i>lett</i> down to <i>carnish</i>, and will <i>troll</i> forth and serve them.
    </li>
    <li>And if <i>she</i> shall <i>troll</i> in the second <i>varda</i>, or <i>troll</i> in the third <i>varda</i>, and find them so, <i>fabed</i> are those <i>serving homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And this know, that if the goodman of the <i>lattie</i> had known what hour the <i>sharpering homie</i> would <i>troll</i>, <i>she</i> would have watched, and not have suffered <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i> to be broken through.
    </li>
    <li>Be ye therefore ready also: for the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> <i>trolleth</i> at an hour when ye think not.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>Petra</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, <i>cacklest</i> thou this parable unto us, or even to all?
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i>, Who then is that <i>fabulous</i> and wise steward, whom <i>her</i> <i>Duchess</i> shall make ruler over <i>her</i> household, to <i>parker</i> them their portion of <i>carnish</i> in due season?
    </li>
    <li><i>Fabed</i> is that <i>serving homie</i>, whom <i>her</i> <i>Duchess</i> when <i>she</i> <i>trolleth</i> shall find so doing.
    </li>
    <li>Of a truth I <i>cackle</i> unto you, that <i>she</i> will make <i>her</i> ruler over all that <i>she</i> hath.
    </li>
    <li>But and if that <i>serving homie</i> <i>cackle</i> in <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>, My <i>Duchess</i> delayeth <i>her</i> <i>trolling</i>; and shall begin to <i>zsa zsa-ed</i> the <i>homieservants</i> and maidens, and to <i>jarry</i> and <i>buvare</i>, and to be <i>daffy</i>;
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> of that <i>serving homie</i> will <i>troll</i> in a <i>journo</i> when <i>she</i> <i>varda-eth</i> not for <i>her</i>, and at an hour when <i>she</i> is not aware, and will cut <i>her</i> in sunder, and will appoint <i>her</i> <i>her</i> portion with the unbelievers.
    </li>
    <li>And that <i>serving homie</i>, which knew <i>her</i> <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s will, and prepared not himself, <i>nishta</i> did according to <i>her</i> will, shall be beaten with many stripes.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> that knew not, and did commit <i>fakements</i> <i>bona</i> of stripes, shall be beaten with <i>nishta dowry</i> stripes. For unto whomsoever <i>dowry</i> is <i>parkered</i>, of <i>her</i> shall be <i>dowry</i> required: and to whom <i>homies</i> have committed <i>dowry</i>, of <i>her</i> they will ask the more.

    <li>I am <i>troll</i> to <i>lau</i> <i>binco fakement</i> on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled?
    </li>
    <li>But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!
    </li>
    <li>Suppose ye that I am <i>troll</i> to <i>parker</i> peace on earth? I <i>cackle</i> you, Nay; but rather division:

    <li>For from henceforth there shall be <i>chinker</i> in <i>una</i> <i>lattie</i> <i>medzered</i>, <i>trey</i> against <i>dewey</i>, and <i>dewey</i> against <i>trey</i>.

    <li>The <i>Auntie</i> shall be <i>medzered</i> against the <i>homie chavvie</i>, and the <i>homie chavvie</i> against the <i>Auntie</i>; the mother against the <i>palone chavvie</i>, and the <i>palone chavvie</i> against the mother; the mother in law against her <i>palone chavvie</i> in law, and the <i>palone chavvie</i> in law against her mother in law.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> also to the <i>homies and palones</i>, When ye <i>varda</i> a cloud rise out of the west, straightway ye <i>cackle</i>, There <i>trolleth</i> a shower; and so it is.
    </li>
    <li>And when ye <i>varda</i> the south wind blow, ye <i>cackle</i>, There will be heat; and it <i>trolleth</i> to pass.

    <li>Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the <i>eke</i> of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that ye <i>nix</i> discern this time?

    <h2>Chapter 13</h2>

    <li>And <i>Josie</i> answering <i>cackled</i> unto them, Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were <i>kerterverers</i> above all the Galilaeans, because they suffered such <i>fakements</i>?
    </li>
    <li>I <i>cackle</i> you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.

    <li>Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> them, think ye that they were <i>kerterverers</i> above all <i>homies</i> that <i>letted</i> in Jerusalem?
    </li>
    <li>I <i>cackle</i> you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> <i>cackled</i> also this parable; A certain <i>homie</i> had a fig tree planted in <i>her</i> vineyard; and <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> and sought fruit thereon, and found none.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i> unto the dresser of <i>her</i> vineyard, <i>varda</i>, these <i>trey</i> years I <i>troll</i> seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> answering <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it:
    </li>
    <li>And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> was teaching in <i>una</i> of the synagogues on the sabbath.
    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, there was a <i>palone</i> which had a <i>Fairy</i> of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>Josie</i> <i>vardad</i> her, <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> her to <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto her, <i>palone</i>, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i> on her: and immediately she was made <i>hettie</i>, and glorified <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that <i>Josie</i> had healed on the sabbath <i>journo</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>homies and palones</i>, There are <i>sey</i> days in which <i>homies</i> ought to <i>acting dickey</i>: in them therefore <i>troll</i> and be healed, and not on the sabbath <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> then answered <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Thou hypocrite, doth not each <i>una</i> of you on the sabbath loose <i>her</i> ox or <i>her</i> ass from the stall, and lead <i>her</i> away to watering?
    </li>
    <li>And ought not this <i>palone</i>, being a <i>palone chavvie</i> of Abraham, whom <i>Sadie</i> hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath <i>journo</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> had <i>cackled</i> these <i>fakements</i>, all <i>her</i> adversaries were ashamed: and all the <i>homies and palones</i> rejoiced for all the <i>fabe</i> <i>fakements</i> that were done by <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i>, Unto what is the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i> like? and whereunto shall I resemble it?
    </li>
    <li>It is like a grain of mustard <i>maria</i>, which a <i>homie</i> <i>lelled</i>, and cast into <i>her</i> garden; and it grew, and waxed a <i>dowry</i> tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it.
    </li>
    <li>And again <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>?
    </li>
    <li>It is like leaven, which a <i>palone</i> <i>lelled</i> and hid in <i>trey</i> measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> through the <i>smokes</i> and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> <i>una</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, are there <i>nishta dowry</i> that be saved? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them,

    <li>Strive to enter in at the <i>hettie</i> gate: for many, I <i>cackle</i> unto you, will <i>charper</i> to enter in, and shall not be able.

    <li>When once the master of the <i>lattie</i> is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand <i>nanti</i>, and to knock at the door, <i>cackling</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, open unto us; and <i>she</i> shall answer and <i>cackle</i> unto you, I know you not whence ye are:

    <li>Then shall ye begin to <i>cackle</i>, We have <i>jarried</i> and <i>bevvied</i> in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> shall <i>cackle</i>, I <i>cackle</i> you, I know you not whence ye are; <i>sling yer hook</i>, all ye workers of <i>codness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>There shall be weeping and gnashing of <i>hampsteads</i>, when ye shall <i>varda</i> Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>, and you yourselves thrust out.

    <li><i>Any road up</i> I must <i>mince</i> to <i>journo</i>, and to morrow, and the <i>journo</i> following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.

    <li>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are <i>laued</i> unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy <i>chavvies</i> together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not!

    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, there was a certain <i>homie</i> before <i>her</i> which had the dropsy.

    <li>And they could not answer <i>her</i> again to these <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when <i>she</i> marked how they chose out the <i>dowriest</i> <i>letties</i>; <i>cackling</i> unto them.

    <li>When thou art bidden of any <i>homie</i> to a wedding, <i>lett</i> not down in the highest room; lest a more honourable <i>homie</i> than thou be bidden of <i>her</i>;

    <li>But when thou art bidden, <i>troll</i> and <i>lett</i> down in the lowest room; that when <i>she</i> that bade thee <i>trolleth</i>, <i>she</i> may <i>cackle</i> unto thee, <i>bencove</i>, <i>troll</i> up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that <i>lett</i> at <i>carnish</i> with thee.
    </li>
    <li>For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and <i>she</i> that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i> also to <i>her</i> that bade <i>her</i>, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, <i>screech</i> not thy <i>bencoves</i>, <i>nishta</i> thy <i>sisters</i>, <i>nishta</i> thy kinsmen, <i>nishta</i> thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee.
    </li>
    <li>But when thou makest a <i>dowry munjarlee</i>, <i>screech</i> the <i>nanti dinarly</i>, the maimed, the <i>nanti wallop</i>, the <i>nanti varda</i>:

    <li>And thou shalt be <i>fabed</i>; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>una</i> of them that sat at <i>carnish</i> with <i>her</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> these <i>fakements</i>, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>fabed</i> is <i>she</i> that shall <i>jarry</i> <i>pannan</i> in the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i> unto <i>her</i>, A certain <i>homie</i> made a <i>dowry</i> supper, and bade many:

    <li>And <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i> at supper time to <i>cackle</i> to them that were bidden, <i>troll</i>; for all <i>fakements</i> are now ready.

    <li>And they all with <i>una</i> consent began to make excuse. The first <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs <i>troll</i> and <i>varda</i> it: I pray thee have me excused.

    <li>And another <i>cackled</i>, I have bought <i>chinker</i> yoke of oxen, and I <i>troll</i> to prove them: I pray thee have me excused.

    <li>And another <i>cackled</i>, I have married a <i>palone affair</i>, and therefore I cannot <i>troll</i>.

    <li>So that <i>serving homie</i> <i>trolled</i>, and shewed <i>her</i> <i>Duchess</i> these <i>fakements</i>.

    <li>Or else, while the other is yet a <i>dowry</i> way off, <i>she</i> sendeth an ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace.

    <li>And if ye have not been <i>fabulous</i> in that which is another <i>homie</i>&#8216;s, who shall <i>parker</i> you that which is your own?
    </li>
    <li>No <i>serving homie</i> can serve <i>dewey</i> masters: for either <i>she</i> will hate the <i>una</i>, and love the other; or else <i>she</i> will hold to the <i>una</i>, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve <i>Gloria</i> and mammon.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>lily laws</i> also, who were covetous, <i>aunt nelled</i> all these <i>fakements</i>: and they derided <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before <i>homies</i>; but <i>Gloria</i> knoweth your <i>thumping cheats</i>: for that which is highly esteemed among <i>homies</i> is <i>dowry cod</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The law and the prophets were until <i>Jane</i>: since that time the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i> is <i>cackled</i>, and every <i>homie</i> presseth into it.
    </li>
    <li>And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than <i>una</i> tittle of the law to fail.
    </li>
    <li>Whosoever <i>laueth</i> away <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her <i>homie affair</i> committeth adultery.
    </li>
    <li>There was a certain rich <i>homie</i>, which was clothed in purple and <i>bona</i> <i>lycra</i>, and fared sumptuously every <i>journo</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was <i>laued</i> at <i>her</i> gate, full of sores,
    </li>
    <li>And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich <i>homie</i>&#8216;s table: moreover the <i>women who are not conventionally attractive</i> <i>trolled</i> and licked <i>her</i> sores.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, that the beggar <i>carked it</i>, and was <i>lelled</i> by the <i>fairies</i> into Abraham&#8217;s bosom: the rich <i>homie</i> also <i>carked it</i>, and was buried;
    </li>
    <li>And in hell <i>she</i> lift up <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i>, being in torments, and <i>vardaeth</i> Abraham <i>nishta ajax</i> off, and Lazarus in <i>her</i> bosom.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> and <i>cackled</i>, <i>Auntie</i> Abraham, have mercy on me, and <i>lau</i> Lazarus, that <i>she</i> may dip the tip of <i>her</i> <i>lupper</i> in <i>aqua</i>, and cool my <i>polari</i>; for I am tormented in this flame.
    </li>
    <li>But Abraham <i>cackled</i>, <i>homie chavvie</i>, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy <i>bona</i> <i>fakements</i>, and likewise Lazarus <i>nana</i> <i>fakements</i>: but now <i>she</i> is comforted, and thou art tormented.
    </li>
    <li>And beside all this, between us and you there is a <i>dowry</i> gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; <i>nishta</i> can they pass to us, that would <i>troll</i> from thence.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, I pray thee therefore, <i>Auntie</i>, that thou wouldest <i>lau</i> <i>her</i> to my <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>For I have <i>chinker</i> <i>sisters</i>; that <i>she</i> may testify unto them, lest they also <i>troll</i> into this place of torment.
    </li>
    <li>Abraham <i>cackleth</i> unto <i>her</i>, They have <i>Maureen</i> and the prophets; let them <i>aunt nell</i> them.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Nay, <i>Auntie</i> Abraham: but if <i>una</i> <i>trolled</i> unto them from the <i>stiff</i>, they will repent.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, If they <i>aunt nell</i> not <i>Maureen</i> and the prophets, <i>nishta</i> will they be persuaded, though <i>una</i> rose from the <i>stiff</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 17</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i> unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will <i>troll</i>: but woe unto <i>her</i>, through whom they <i>troll</i>!
    </li>
    <li>It were <i>benar</i> for <i>her</i> that a millstone were hanged about <i>her</i> neck, and <i>she</i> cast into the sea, than that <i>she</i> should offend <i>una</i> of these <i>bijou</i> ones.
    </li>
    <li><i>Lell</i> heed to yourselves: If thy <i>sister</i> <i>caterver</i> against thee, rebuke <i>her</i>; and if <i>she</i> repent, forgive <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And if <i>she</i> <i>caterver</i> against thee <i>setter</i> times in a <i>journo</i>, and <i>setter</i> times in a <i>journo</i> turn again to thee, <i>cackling</i>, I repent; thou shalt forgive <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the apostles <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>, Increase our faith.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i>, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard <i>maria</i>, ye might <i>cackle</i> unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.
    </li>
    <li>But which of you, having a <i>serving homie</i> plowing or feeding cattle, will <i>cackle</i> unto <i>her</i> by and by, when <i>she</i> is <i>troll</i> from the field, <i>troll</i> and <i>lett</i> down to <i>carnish</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And will not rather <i>cackle</i> unto <i>her</i>, Make ready wherewith I may <i>bevvy</i>, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have <i>jarried</i> and <i>daffy</i>; and afterward thou shalt <i>jarry</i> and <i>buvare</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Doth <i>she</i> thank that <i>serving homie</i> because <i>she</i> did the <i>fakements</i> that were commanded <i>her</i>? I trow not.
    </li>
    <li>So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those <i>fakements</i> which are commanded you, <i>cackle</i>, We are unprofitable <i>serving homies</i>: we have done that which was our duty to do.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, as <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> to Jerusalem, that <i>she</i> passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.
    </li>
    <li>And as <i>she</i> entered into a certain village, there met <i>her</i> <i>dacha</i> <i>homies</i> that were lepers, which stood <i>nishta ajax</i> off:
    </li>
    <li>And they lifted up their voices, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>Josie</i>, Master, have mercy on us.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> them, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>troll</i> shew yourselves unto the <i>godly homies</i>. <i>Any road up</i>, that, as they <i>trolled</i>, they were cleansed.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>una</i> of them, when <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> that <i>she</i> was healed, turned back, and with a loud <i>cackling fakement</i> glorified <i>Gloria</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And fell down on <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> at <i>her</i> <i>plates</i>, giving <i>her</i> thanks: and <i>she</i> was a <i>dorcas</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> answering <i>cackled</i>, Were there not <i>dacha</i> cleansed? but where are the <i>sey trey</i>?
    </li>
    <li>There are not found that <i>trolled back to</i> <i>parker</i> <i>fabeness</i> to <i>Gloria</i>, save this stranger.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Arise, <i>troll</i> thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> was demanded of the <i>lily laws</i>, when the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i> should <i>troll</i>, <i>she</i> answered them and <i>cackled</i>, The kingdom of <i>Gloria</i> <i>trolleth</i> not with observation:
    </li>
    <li><i>Nishta</i> shall they <i>cackle</i>, Lo here! or, lo there! for, <i>varda</i>, the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i> is within you.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto the disciples, The days will <i>troll</i>, when ye shall <i>fancy</i> to <i>varda</i> <i>una</i> of the days of the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, and <i>nanti</i> <i>varda</i> it.
    </li>
    <li>And they shall <i>cackle</i> to you, <i>varda</i> here; or, <i>varda</i> there: <i>troll not</i> after them, <i>nishta</i> <i>troll after</i> them.
    </li>
    <li>For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the <i>una</i> part under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> be in <i>her</i> <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But first must <i>she</i> suffer many <i>fakements</i>, and be rejected of this generation.
    </li>
    <li>And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>They did <i>jarry</i>, they drank, they married <i>palone affairs</i>, they were <i>parkered</i> in marriage, until the <i>journo</i> that Noe entered into the <i>bijou arkette</i>, and the <i>dowry aqua</i> <i>trolled</i>, and <i>battyfanged</i> them all.
    </li>
    <li>Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did <i>jarry</i>, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;
    </li>
    <li>But the same <i>journo</i> that Lot <i>trolled</i> out of Sodom it rained <i>binco fakement</i> and brimstone from heaven, and <i>battyfanged</i> them all.
    </li>
    <li>Even thus shall it be in the <i>journo</i> when the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> is revealed.
    </li>
    <li>In that <i>journo</i>, <i>she</i> which shall be upon the housetop, and <i>her</i> stuff in the <i>lattie</i>, let <i>her</i> not <i>troll</i> down to <i>lell</i> it away: and <i>she</i> that is in the field, let <i>her</i> likewise not return back.
    </li>
    <li>Remember Lot&#8217;s <i>palone affair</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Whosoever shall <i>charper</i> to save <i>her</i> life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose <i>her</i> life shall preserve it.
    </li>
    <li>I <i>cackle</i> you, in that <i>nochy</i> there shall be <i>dewey</i> <i>homies</i> in <i>una</i> bed; the <i>una</i> shall be <i>lelled</i>, and the other shall be <i>dry</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Dewey</i> <i>palones</i> shall be grinding together; the <i>una</i> shall be <i>lelled</i>, and the other <i>dry</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Dewey</i> <i>homies</i> shall be in the field; the <i>una</i> shall be <i>lelled</i>, and the other <i>dry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they answered and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Where, <i>Duchess</i>? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Wheresoever the <i>lucoddy</i> is, thither will the eagles be gathered together.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 18</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> a parable unto them to this end, that <i>homies</i> ought always to pray, and not to faint;
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackling</i>, There was in a <i>smoke</i> a <i>beak</i>, which feared not <i>Gloria</i>, <i>nishta</i> regarded <i>homie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And there was a widow in that <i>smoke</i>; and she <i>trolled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>do the rights</i> me of mine adversary.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> would not for a while: but afterward <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> within himself, Though I fear not <i>Gloria</i>, <i>nishta</i> regard <i>homie</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will <i>do the rights</i> her, lest by her continual <i>trolling</i> she <i>a stretcher case</i> me.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>aunt nell</i> what the unjust <i>beak</i> <i>cackleth</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And shall not <i>Gloria</i> <i>do the rights</i> <i>her</i> own elect, which <i>screech</i> <i>journo</i> and <i>nochy</i> unto <i>her</i>, though <i>she</i> bear long with them?
    </li>
    <li>I <i>cackle</i> you that <i>she</i> will <i>do the rights</i> them speedily. <i>Any road up</i> when the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> <i>trolleth</i>, shall <i>she</i> find faith on the earth?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were <i>bona</i>, and despised others:
    </li>
    <li><i>Dewey</i> <i>homies</i> <i>trolled</i> up into the <i>holy carsey</i> to pray; the <i>una</i> a <i>lily law</i>, and the other a <i>landlady</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>lily law</i> stood and prayed thus with himself, <i>Gloria</i>, I thank thee, that I am not as other <i>homies</i> are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this <i>landlady</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I <i>nishta manjarry</i> twice in the week, I <i>parker</i> tithes of all that I possess.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>landlady</i>, standing <i>nishta ajax</i> off, would not lift up so <i>dowry</i> as <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i> unto heaven, but <i>slapped</i> upon <i>her</i> breast, <i>cackling</i>, <i>Gloria</i> be merciful to me a sinner.
    </li>
    <li>I <i>cackle</i> you, this <i>homie</i> <i>trolled</i> down to <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i> justified rather than the other: for every <i>una</i> that exalteth himself shall be abased; and <i>she</i> that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
    </li>
    <li>And they brought unto <i>her</i> also <i>lullaby cheats</i>, that <i>she</i> would <i>reef</i> them: but when <i>her</i> disciples <i>vardad</i> it, they rebuked them.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>Josie</i> <i>screeched</i> them unto <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Suffer <i>bijou</i> <i>chavvies</i> to <i>troll</i> unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Verily I <i>cackle</i> unto you, Whosoever shall not <i>lall</i> the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i> as a <i>bijou</i> <i>chavvie</i> shall in no wise enter therein.
    </li>
    <li>And a certain ruler asked <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>bona</i> Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Why callest thou me <i>bona</i>? none is <i>bona</i>, save <i>una</i>, that is, <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thou knowest the <i>butch lavs</i>, <i>nix</i> commit adultery, <i>nix</i> <i>ferricadoza</i>, <i>nix</i> <i>sharper</i>, <i>nix</i> bear false <i>varda-ing fakement</i>, Honour thy <i>Auntie</i> and thy mother.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, All these have I kept from my <i>beandom</i> up.
    </li>
    <li>Now when <i>Josie</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> these <i>fakements</i>, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Yet lackest thou <i>una</i> <i>fakement</i>: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the <i>nanti dinarly</i>, and thou shalt have <i>gelt</i> in heaven: and <i>troll</i>, <i>troll after</i> me.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> this, <i>she</i> was <i>dowry</i> <i>shardaful</i>: for <i>she</i> was <i>dowry</i> rich.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>Josie</i> <i>vardad</i> that <i>she</i> was <i>dowry</i> <i>shardaful</i>, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>!
    </li>
    <li>For it is easier for a camel to <i>troll</i> through a needle&#8217;s <i>ogle</i>, than for a rich <i>homie</i> to enter into the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they that <i>aunt nelled</i> it <i>cackled</i>, Who then can be saved?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, The <i>fakements</i> which are impossible with <i>homies</i> are possible with <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>Petra</i> <i>cackled</i>, Lo, we have <i>dry</i> all, and <i>trolled after</i> thee.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Verily I <i>cackle</i> unto you, There is no <i>homie</i> that hath <i>dry</i> <i>lattie</i>, or parents, or <i>sisters</i>, or <i>palone affair</i>, or <i>chavvies</i>, for the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>&#8216;s sake,
    </li>
    <li>Who shall not <i>lall</i> manifold more in this present time, and in the world to <i>troll</i> life everlasting.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> unto <i>her</i> the <i>kenza</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>varda</i>, we <i>troll</i> up to Jerusalem, and all <i>fakements</i> that are <i>screeved</i> by the prophets concerning the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> shall be accomplished.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> shall be <i>laued</i> unto the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:
    </li>
    <li>And they shall scourge <i>her</i>, and put <i>her</i> to <i>carking it</i>: and the third <i>journo</i> <i>she</i> shall rise again.
    </li>
    <li>And they understood none of these <i>fakements</i>: and this <i>cackling</i> was hid from them, <i>nishta</i> knew they the <i>fakements</i> which were <i>cackled</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, that as <i>she</i> was <i>troll</i> <i>ajax</i> unto Jericho, a certain <i>nanti varda</i> <i>homie</i> sat by the way side begging:
    </li>
    <li>And hearing the multitude <i>troll by</i>, <i>she</i> asked what it meant.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>cackled</i> <i>her</i>, that <i>Josie</i> of Nazareth passeth by.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>Josie</i>, thou <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>Davina</i>, have mercy on me.
    </li>
    <li>And they which <i>trolled</i> before rebuked <i>her</i>, that <i>she</i> should hold <i>her</i> peace: but <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> so <i>dowry</i> the more, Thou <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>Davina</i>, have mercy on me.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> stood, and commanded <i>her</i> to be brought unto <i>her</i>: and when <i>she</i> was <i>troll</i> near, <i>she</i> asked <i>her</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackling</i>, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, that I may <i>lall</i> my <i>vardaing</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>lall</i> thy <i>vardaing</i>: thy faith hath saved thee.
    </li>
    <li>And immediately <i>she</i> <i>lalled</i> <i>her</i> <i>vardaing</i>, and <i>trolled after</i> <i>her</i>, glorifying <i>Gloria</i>: and all the <i>homies and palones</i>, when they <i>vardad</i> it, <i>parkered</i> praise unto <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 19</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> entered and passed through Jericho.
    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, there was a <i>homie</i> named Zacchaeus, which was the <i>dowriest</i> among the <i>landladies</i>, and <i>she</i> was rich.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> sought to <i>varda</i> <i>Josie</i> who <i>she</i> was; and could not for the press, because <i>she</i> was <i>bijou</i> of stature.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to <i>varda</i> <i>her</i>: for <i>she</i> was to pass that way.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>Josie</i> <i>trolled</i> to the place, <i>she</i> looked up, and <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Zacchaeus, make haste, and <i>troll</i> down; for to <i>journo</i> I must <i>lett</i> at thy <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> made haste, and <i>trolled</i> down, and <i>lalled</i> <i>her</i> joyfully.
    </li>
    <li>And when they <i>vardad</i> it, they all murmured, <i>cackling</i>, That <i>she</i> was <i>trolled</i> to be guest with a <i>homie</i> that is a sinner.
    </li>
    <li>And Zacchaeus stood, and <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>: <i>varda</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, the half of my goods I <i>parker</i> to the <i>nanti dinarly</i>; and if I have <i>lelled</i> any <i>fakement</i> from any <i>homie</i> by false accusation, I restore <i>her</i> <i>quarterfold</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, This <i>journo</i> is salvation <i>troll</i> to this <i>lattie</i>, forsomuch as <i>she</i> also is a <i>homie chavvie</i> of Abraham.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> is <i>troll</i> to <i>charper</i> and to save that which was lost.
    </li>
    <li>And as they <i>aunt nelled</i> these <i>fakements</i>, <i>she</i> added and <i>cackled</i> a parable, because <i>she</i> was <i>ajax</i> to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i> should immediately appear.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> <i>cackled</i> therefore, A certain nobleman <i>trolled</i> into a far country to <i>lall</i> for himself a kingdom, and to return.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> <i>her</i> <i>dacha</i> <i>serving homies</i>, and <i>laued</i> them <i>dacha</i> pounds, and <i>cackled</i> unto them, Occupy till I <i>troll</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>her</i> citizens hated <i>her</i>, and <i>laued</i> a message after <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, We will not have this <i>homie</i> to reign over us.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, that when <i>she</i> was <i>trolled back</i>, having <i>lalled</i> the kingdom, then <i>she</i> commanded these <i>serving homies</i> to be <i>screeched</i> unto <i>her</i>, to whom <i>she</i> had <i>parkered</i> the <i>dinarly</i>, that <i>she</i> might know how <i>dowry</i> every <i>homie</i> had gained by trading.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>trolled</i> the first, <i>cackling</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, thy pound hath gained <i>dacha</i> pounds.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Well, thou <i>bona</i> <i>serving homie</i>: because thou hast been <i>fabulous</i> in a <i>dowry</i> <i>bijou</i>, have thou authority over <i>dacha</i> <i>smokes</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the second <i>trolled</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, thy pound hath gained <i>chinker</i> pounds.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> likewise to <i>her</i>, Be thou also over <i>chinker</i> <i>smokes</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And another <i>trolled</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, <i>varda</i>, here is thy pound, which I have kept <i>laued</i> up in a napkin:
    </li>
    <li>For I feared thee, because thou art an austere <i>homie</i>: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i> unto <i>her</i>, Out of thine own <i>screech</i> will I <i>beak</i> thee, thou <i>naff</i> <i>serving homie</i>. Thou knewest that I was an austere <i>homie</i>, taking up that I <i>laued</i> not down, and reaping that I did not sow:
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore then gavest not thou my <i>dinarly</i> into the bank, that at my <i>trolling</i> I might have required mine own with usury?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them that stood by, <i>lell</i> from <i>her</i> the pound, and <i>parker</i> it to <i>her</i> that hath <i>dacha</i> pounds.
    </li>
    <li>(And they <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, <i>she</i> hath <i>dacha</i> pounds. )
    </li>
    <li>For I <i>cackle</i> unto you, That unto every <i>una</i> which hath shall be <i>parkered</i>; and from <i>her</i> that hath not, even that <i>she</i> hath shall be <i>lelled</i> away from <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, <i>parker</i> hither, and <i>ferricadooza</i> them before me.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> had thus <i>cackled</i>, <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> before, <i>trolling up</i> up to Jerusalem.

    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when <i>she</i> was <i>troll</i> <i>ajax</i> to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount <i>screeched</i> the mount of Olives, <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> <i>dewey</i> of <i>her</i> disciples,

    <li><i>Cackling</i>, <i>troll</i> ye into the village over against you; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never <i>homie</i> sat: loose <i>her</i>, and <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> hither.
    </li>
    <li>And if any <i>homie</i> ask you, Why do ye loose <i>her</i>? thus shall ye <i>cackle</i> unto <i>her</i>, Because the <i>Duchess</i> hath need of <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they that were <i>laued</i> <i>trolled</i> their way, and found even as <i>she</i> had <i>cackled</i> unto them.

    <li>And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof <i>cackled</i> unto them, Why loose ye the colt?

    <li>And they <i>cackled</i>, The <i>Duchess</i> hath need of <i>her</i>.

    <li>And they brought <i>her</i> to <i>Josie</i>: and they cast their <i>frocks</i> upon the colt, and they set <i>Josie</i> thereon.
    </li>
    <li>And as <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i>, they spread their <i>zhoosh</i> in the way.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> was <i>troll</i> <i>ajax</i>, even now at the <i>trolling down</i> of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise <i>Gloria</i> with a loud <i>cackling fakement</i> for all the <i>dowry butch</i> works that they had <i>vardad</i>;
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackling</i>, <i>fabed</i> be the <i>dowriest homie</i> that <i>trolleth</i> in the name of the <i>Duchess</i>: peace in heaven, and <i>fabeness</i> in the highest.

    <li>And some of the <i>lily laws</i> from among the multitude <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Master, rebuke thy disciples.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> answered and <i>cackled</i> unto them, I <i>cackle</i> you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately <i>screech</i> out.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> was <i>troll</i> near, <i>she</i> beheld the <i>smoke</i>, and <i>parnied</i> over it,

    <li><i>Cackling</i>, If thou hadst known, even thou, at <i>nanti dowriest</i> in this thy <i>journo</i>, the <i>fakements</i> which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine <i>ogles</i>.

    <li>For the days shall <i>troll</i> upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,

    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> into the <i>holy carsey</i>, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought;

    <li><i>Cackling</i> unto them, It is <i>screeved</i>, My <i>lattie</i> is the <i>lattie</i> of <i>meshigener muttering</i>: but ye have made it a den of <i>sharpering homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> taught daily in the <i>holy carsey</i>. But the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homies</i> and the <i>betty bracelets</i> and the <i>dowriest</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i> sought to <i>battyfang</i> <i>her</i>,

    <h2>Chapter 20</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, that on <i>una</i> of those days, as <i>she</i> taught the <i>homies and palones</i> in the <i>holy carsey</i>, and <i>cackled</i> the <i>gossip</i>, the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homies</i> and the <i>betty bracelets</i> <i>trolled</i> upon <i>her</i> with the <i>fungi</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>cackle</i> us, by what authority doest thou these <i>fakements</i>? or who is <i>she</i> that <i>parkered</i> thee this authority?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> answered and <i>cackled</i> unto them, I will also ask you <i>una</i> <i>fakement</i>; and answer me:
    </li>
    <li>The baptism of <i>Jane</i>, was it from heaven, or of <i>homies</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And they reasoned with themselves, <i>cackling</i>, If we shall <i>cackle</i>, From heaven; <i>she</i> will <i>cackle</i>, Why then believed ye <i>her</i> not?
    </li>
    <li>But and if we <i>cackle</i>, Of <i>homies</i>; all the <i>homies and palones</i> will stone us: for they be persuaded that <i>Jane</i> was a prophet.
    </li>
    <li>And they answered, that they could not <i>cackle</i> whence it was.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>nishta</i> <i>cackle</i> I you by what authority I do these <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then began <i>she</i> to <i>cackle</i> to the <i>homies and palones</i> this parable; A certain <i>homie</i> planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and <i>trolled</i> into a far country for a long time.
    </li>
    <li>And at the season <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> a <i>serving homie</i> to the husbandmen, that they should <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen <i>zsa zsa-ed</i> <i>her</i>, and <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> away empty.
    </li>
    <li>And again <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> another <i>serving homie</i>: and they <i>zsa zsa-ed</i> <i>her</i> also, and entreated <i>her</i> shamefully, and <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> away empty.
    </li>
    <li>And again <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> a third: and they wounded <i>her</i> also, and cast <i>her</i> out.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> the <i>Duchess</i> of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will <i>lau</i> my beloved <i>homie chavvie</i>: it may be they will reverence <i>her</i> when they <i>varda</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But when the husbandmen <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i>, they reasoned among themselves, <i>cackling</i>, This is the heir: <i>troll</i>, let us <i>ferricadoza</i> <i>her</i>, that the inheritance may be ours.
    </li>
    <li>So they cast <i>her</i> out of the vineyard, and <i>ferricadozad</i> <i>her</i>. What therefore shall the <i>Duchess</i> of the vineyard do unto them?
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> shall <i>troll</i> and <i>battyfang</i> these husbandmen, and shall <i>parker</i> the vineyard to others. And when they <i>aunt nelled</i> it, they <i>cackled</i>, <i>Gloria</i> forbid.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> beheld them, and <i>cackled</i>, What is this then that is <i>screeved</i>, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the <i>eke</i> of the corner?
    </li>
    <li>Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind <i>her</i> to powder.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homies</i> and the <i>betty bracelets</i> the same hour sought to <i>lett</i> <i>fambles</i> on <i>her</i>; and they feared the <i>homies and palones</i>: for they perceived that <i>she</i> had <i>cackled</i> this parable against them.
    </li>
    <li>And they watched <i>her</i>, and <i>laued</i> forth spies, which should feign themselves just <i>homies</i>, that they might <i>lell</i> hold of <i>her</i> <i>lavs</i>, that so they might deliver <i>her</i> unto the power and authority of the governor.
    </li>
    <li>And they asked <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Master, we know that thou <i>cackleth</i> and teachest rightly, <i>nishta</i> acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of <i>Gloria</i> truly:
    </li>
    <li>Is it lawful for us to <i>parker</i> tribute unto Caesar, or no?
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> perceived their craftiness, and <i>cackled</i> unto them, Why tempt ye me?
    </li>
    <li>Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and <i>cackled</i>, Caesar&#8217;s.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the <i>fakements</i> which be Caesar&#8217;s, and unto <i>Gloria</i> the <i>fakements</i> which be <i>Gloria</i>&#8216;s.
    </li>
    <li>And they could not <i>lell</i> hold of <i>her</i> <i>lavs</i> before the <i>homies and palones</i>: and they marvelled at <i>her</i> answer, and held their peace.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>trolled</i> to <i>her</i> certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked <i>her</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackling</i>, Master, <i>Maureen</i> <i>screeved</i> unto us, If any <i>homie</i>&#8216;s <i>sister</i> <i>cark it</i>, having a <i>palone affair</i>, and <i>she</i> <i>cark it</i> <i>nanti</i> <i>chavvies</i>, that <i>her</i> <i>sister</i> should <i>lell</i> <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>, and raise up <i>maria</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>sister</i>.
    </li>
    <li>There were therefore <i>setter</i> <i>sisters</i>: and the first <i>lelled</i> a <i>palone affair</i>, and <i>carked it</i> <i>nanti</i> <i>chavvies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the second <i>lelled</i> her to <i>palone affair</i>, and <i>she</i> <i>carked it</i> childless.
    </li>
    <li>And the third <i>lelled</i> her; and in like manner the <i>setter</i> also: and they <i>dry</i> no <i>chavvies</i>, and <i>carked it</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Last of all the <i>palone</i> <i>carked it</i> also.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore in the resurrection whose <i>palone affair</i> of them is she? for <i>setter</i> had her to <i>palone affair</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> answering <i>cackled</i> unto them, The <i>chavvies</i> of this world marry, and are <i>parkered</i> in marriage:
    </li>
    <li>But they which shall be accounted <i>bona</i> to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the <i>stiff</i>, <i>nishta</i> marry, <i>nishta</i> are <i>parkered</i> in marriage:
    </li>
    <li><i>Nishta</i> can they <i>cark it</i> any more: for they are equal unto the <i>fairies</i>; and are the <i>chavvies</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, being the <i>chavvies</i> of the resurrection.
    </li>
    <li>Now that the <i>stiff</i> are raised, even <i>Maureen</i> shewed at the bush, when <i>she</i> <i>screecheth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> the <i>Gloria</i> of Abraham, and the <i>Gloria</i> of Isaac, and the <i>Gloria</i> of Jacob.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> is not a <i>Gloria</i> of the <i>stiff</i>, but of the living: for all live unto <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then certain of the <i>betty bracelets</i> answering <i>cackled</i>, Master, thou hast well <i>cackled</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And after that they durst not ask <i>her</i> any question at all.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, How <i>cackle</i> they that <i>Crystal</i> is <i>Davina</i>&#8216;s <i>homie chavvie</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Davina</i> himself <i>cackleth</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of Psalms, The <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto my <i>Duchess</i>, <i>lett</i> thou on my <i>sweet martini</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.
    </li>
    <li><i>Davina</i> therefore <i>screecheth</i> <i>her</i> <i>Duchess</i>, how is <i>she</i> then <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Then in the audience of all the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> disciples,
    </li>
    <li><i>Gardy loo</i> of the <i>betty bracelets</i>, which <i>fancy</i> to <i>mince</i> in long <i>frocks</i>, and love <i>boyno</i> in the <i>bodegas</i>, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the <i>dowriest</i> <i>letties</i> at <i>dowry munjarlees</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Which devour widows&#8217; <i>latties</i>, and for a shew make long <i>meshigener mutterings</i>: the same shall <i>lall</i> <i>dowrier</i> damnation.

    <li>And <i>she</i> looked up, and <i>vardad</i> the rich <i>homies</i> <i>chucking</i> their gifts into the treasury.

    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> also a certain <i>nanti dinarly</i> widow <i>chucking</i> in thither <i>dewey</i> mites.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Of a truth I <i>cackle</i> unto you, that this <i>nanti dinarly</i> widow hath cast in more than they all:
    </li>
    <li>For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the <i>parkerings</i> of <i>Gloria</i>: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had.
    </li>
    <li>And as some <i>cackled</i> of the <i>holy carsey</i>, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>,
    </li>
    <li>As for these <i>fakements</i> which ye <i>varda</i>, the days will <i>troll</i>, in the which there shall not be <i>dry</i> <i>una</i> stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.
    </li>
    <li>And they asked <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Master, but when shall these <i>fakements</i> be? and what sign will there be when these <i>fakements</i> shall <i>troll</i> to pass?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>lell</i> heed that ye be not <i>mogued</i>: for many shall <i>troll</i> in my name, <i>cackling</i>, I am <i>Crystal</i>; and the time draweth near: <i>troll</i> ye not therefore after them.
    </li>
    <li>But when ye shall <i>aunt nell</i> of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these <i>fakements</i> must first <i>troll</i> to pass; but the end is not by and by.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i> unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>dowry</i> earthquakes shall be in divers places, and <i>nix munjarlees</i>, and pestilences; and fearful sights and <i>dowry</i> signs shall there be from heaven.

    <li>But before all these, they shall <i>lett</i> their <i>fambles</i> on you, and <i>chivvy</i> you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before <i>dowriest homies</i> and rulers for my name&#8217;s sake.

    <li>And it shall turn to you for a testimony.
    </li>
    <li>Settle it therefore in your <i>thumping cheats</i>, not to meditate before what ye shall answer:

    <li>For I will <i>parker</i> you a <i>screech</i> and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay <i>nishta</i> resist.

    <li>And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and <i>sisters</i>, and kinsfolks, and <i>bencoves</i>; and some of you shall they cause to be put to <i>carking it</i>.

    <li>And ye shall be hated of all <i>homies</i> for my name&#8217;s sake.
    </li>
    <li>But there shall not an <i>riah</i> of your <i>eke</i> perish.

    <li>In your patience possess ye your <i>nishta lucoddies</i>.

    <li>And when ye shall <i>varda</i> Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is <i>ajax</i>.

    <li>Then let them which are in Judaea <i>scarper</i> to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it <i>troll off</i> out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto.

    <li>And they shall fall by the edge of the <i>dowry efink</i>, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be <i>minced</i> down of the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>, until the times of the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> be fulfilled.

    <li>And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the <i>twinkling fakements</i>; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves <i>butch shrieking</i>;

    <li>Heaven and earth shall <i>troll away</i>: but my <i>lavs</i> shall not <i>troll away</i>.

    <li>And when the hour was <i>troll</i>, <i>she</i> sat down, and the <i>kenza</i> apostles with <i>her</i>.

    <li>Likewise also the cup after supper, <i>cackling</i>, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.

    <li>Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.

    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, When I <i>laued</i> you <i>nanti</i> purse, and scrip, and <i>slingbacks</i>, lacked ye any <i>fakement</i>? And they <i>cackled</i>, <i>nishter</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i> unto them, But now, <i>she</i> that hath a purse, let <i>her</i> <i>lell</i> it, and likewise <i>her</i> scrip: and <i>she</i> that hath no <i>dowry efink</i>, let <i>her</i> sell <i>her</i> <i>frock</i>, and buy <i>una</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For I <i>cackle</i> unto you, that this that is <i>screeved</i> must yet be accomplished in me, And <i>she</i> was reckoned among the transgressors: for the <i>fakements</i> concerning me have an end.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>cackled</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, <i>varda</i>, here are <i>dewey</i> <i>dowry efinks</i>. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, It is enough.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> out, and <i>trolled</i>, as <i>she</i> was wont, to the mount of Olives; and <i>her</i> disciples also <i>trolled after</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> was at the place, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> was withdrawn from them about a stone&#8217;s cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackling</i>, <i>Auntie</i>, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: <i>any road up</i> not my will, but thine, be done.
    </li>
    <li>And there appeared an <i>fairy</i> unto <i>her</i> from heaven, strengthening <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And being in an agony <i>she</i> prayed more earnestly: and <i>her</i> sweat was as it were <i>dowry</i> drops of blood falling down to the ground.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> rose up from <i>meshigener muttering</i>, and was <i>troll</i> to <i>her</i> disciples, <i>she</i> found them sleeping for <i>sharda</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackled</i> unto them, Why <i>letty</i> ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.
    </li>
    <li>And while <i>she</i> yet <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i> a multitude, and <i>she</i> that was <i>screeched</i> Judas, <i>una</i> of the <i>kenza</i>, <i>trolled</i> before them, and drew near unto <i>Josie</i> to kiss <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>Josie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Judas, betrayest thou the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> with a kiss?
    </li>
    <li>When they which were about <i>her</i> <i>vardad</i> what would <i>troll after</i>, they <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, shall we <i>slap</i> with the <i>dowry efink</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>una</i> of them <i>slapped</i> the <i>serving homie</i> of the high <i>godly homie</i>, and cut off <i>her</i> <i>sweet</i> <i>aunt nelling cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> answered and <i>cackled</i>, Suffer ye thus far. And <i>she</i> <i>reefed</i> <i>her</i> <i>aunt nelling cheat</i>, and healed <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>Josie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homies</i>, and captains of the <i>holy carsey</i>, and the <i>fungi</i>, which were <i>troll</i> to <i>her</i>, Be ye <i>troll</i> out, as against a <i>sharpering homie</i>, with <i>dowry efinks</i> and staves?
    </li>
    <li>When I was daily with you in the <i>holy carsey</i>, ye stretched forth no <i>fambles</i> against me: but this is your hour, and the power of <i>munge</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>lelled</i> they <i>her</i>, and led <i>her</i>, and brought <i>her</i> into the high <i>godly homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>. And <i>Petra</i> <i>trolled after</i> <i>nishta ajax</i> off.
    </li>
    <li>And when they had kindled a <i>binco fakement</i> in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, <i>Petra</i> sat down among them.
    </li>
    <li>But a certain maid beheld <i>her</i> as <i>she</i> sat by the <i>binco fakement</i>, and earnestly looked upon <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, This <i>homie</i> was also with <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> denied <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>palone</i>, I know <i>her</i> not.
    </li>
    <li>And after a <i>bijou</i> while another <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Thou art also of them. And <i>Petra</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>homie</i>, I am not.
    </li>
    <li>And about the space of <i>una</i> hour after another confidently affirmed, <i>cackling</i>, Of a truth this fellow also was with <i>her</i>: for <i>she</i> is a Galilaean.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Petra</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>homie</i>, I know not what thou <i>cackleth</i>. And immediately, while <i>she</i> yet <i>cackled</i>, the cock crew.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> turned, and looked upon <i>Petra</i>. And <i>Petra</i> remembered the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, how <i>she</i> had <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Petra</i> <i>trolled</i> out, and <i>parnied</i> bitterly.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>homies</i> that held <i>Josie</i> mocked <i>her</i>, and <i>slapped</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when they had blindfolded <i>her</i>, they struck <i>her</i> on the <i>eke</i>, and asked <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Prophesy, who is it that <i>slapped</i> thee?
    </li>
    <li>And many other <i>fakements</i> blasphemously <i>cackled</i> they against <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And as soon as it was <i>journo</i>, the <i>fungi</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i> and the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homies</i> and the <i>betty bracelets</i> <i>trolled</i> together, and led <i>her</i> into their council, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Art thou the <i>Crystal</i>? <i>cackle</i> us. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, If I <i>cackle</i> you, ye will not believe:
    </li>
    <li>And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, <i>nishta</i> let me <i>troll</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Hereafter shall the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> <i>lett</i> on the <i>sweet martini</i> of the power of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> they all, Art thou then the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Ye <i>cackle</i> that I am.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>cackled</i>, What need we any further <i>varda-ing fakement</i>? for we ourselves have <i>aunt nelled</i> of <i>her</i> own <i>screech</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 23</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And the whole multitude of them arose, and led <i>her</i> unto Pilate.
    </li>
    <li>And they began to accuse <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to <i>parker</i> tribute to Caesar, <i>cackling</i> that <i>she</i> himself is <i>Crystal</i> a <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Pilate asked <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Art thou the <i>dowriest homie</i> of the <i>kosher homies</i>? And <i>she</i> answered <i>her</i> and <i>cackled</i>, Thou <i>cackleth</i> it.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> Pilate to the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homies</i> and to the <i>homies and palones</i>, I find no fault in this <i>homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they were the more fierce, <i>cackling</i>, <i>she</i> stirreth up the <i>homies and palones</i>, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.
    </li>
    <li>When Pilate <i>aunt nelled</i> of Galilee, <i>she</i> asked whether the <i>homie</i> were a Galilaean.
    </li>
    <li>And as soon as <i>she</i> knew that <i>she</i> belonged unto Herod&#8217;s jurisdiction, <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.
    </li>
    <li>And when Herod <i>vardad</i> <i>Josie</i>, <i>she</i> was exceeding glad: for <i>she</i> was desirous to <i>varda</i> <i>her</i> of a long season, because <i>she</i> had <i>aunt nelled</i> many <i>fakements</i> of <i>her</i>; and <i>she</i> hoped to have <i>vardad</i> some miracle done by <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>she</i> questioned with <i>her</i> in many <i>lavs</i>; but <i>she</i> answered <i>her</i> <i>nishter</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homies</i> and <i>betty bracelets</i> stood and vehemently accused <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Herod with <i>her</i> <i>homies</i> of <i>barney</i> set <i>her</i> at nought, and mocked <i>her</i>, and arrayed <i>her</i> in a gorgeous <i>frock</i>, and <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> again to Pilate.
    </li>
    <li>And the same <i>journo</i> Pilate and Herod were made <i>bencoves</i> together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.
    </li>
    <li>And Pilate, when <i>she</i> had <i>screeched</i> together the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homies</i> and the rulers and the <i>homies and palones</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackled</i> unto them, Ye have brought this <i>homie</i> unto me, as <i>una</i> that perverteth the <i>homies and palones</i>: and, <i>varda</i>, I, having examined <i>her</i> before you, have found no fault in this <i>homie</i> <i>reefing</i> those <i>fakements</i> whereof ye accuse <i>her</i>:
    </li>
    <li>No, <i>nishta</i> yet Herod: for I <i>laued</i> you to <i>her</i>; and, lo, <i>nishter</i> <i>bona</i> of <i>carking it</i> is done unto <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I will therefore chastise <i>her</i>, and release <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>(For of necessity <i>she</i> must release <i>una</i> unto them at the <i>dowry munjarlee</i>. )
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>screeched</i> out all at once, <i>cackling</i>, Away with this <i>homie</i>, and release unto us Barabbas:
    </li>
    <li>(Who for a certain sedition made in the <i>smoke</i>, and for murder, was cast into <i>charpering carsey</i>. )
    </li>
    <li>Pilate therefore, willing to release <i>Josie</i>, <i>cackled</i> again to them.
    </li>
    <li>But they <i>screeched</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Crucify <i>her</i>, crucify <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them the third time, Why, what <i>nana</i> hath <i>she</i> done? I have found no cause of <i>carking it</i> in <i>her</i>: I will therefore chastise <i>her</i>, and let <i>her</i> <i>troll</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that <i>she</i> might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homies</i> prevailed.
    </li>
    <li>And Pilate <i>parkered</i> sentence that it should be as they required.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> released unto them <i>her</i> that for sedition and murder was cast into <i>charpering carsey</i>, whom they had <i>fancied</i>; but <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> <i>Josie</i> to their will.
    </li>
    <li>And as they led <i>her</i> away, they <i>laued</i> hold upon <i>una</i> <i>Simone</i>, a Cyrenian, <i>trolling</i> out of the country, and on <i>her</i> they <i>laued</i> the cross, that <i>she</i> might bear it after <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And there <i>trolled after</i> <i>her</i> a <i>dowry</i> company of <i>homies and palones</i>, and of <i>palones</i>, which also bewailed and lamented <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>Josie</i> turning unto them <i>cackled</i>, <i>palone chavvies</i> of Jerusalem, <i>parnie</i> not for me, but <i>parnie</i> for yourselves, and for your <i>chavvies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For, <i>varda</i>, the days are <i>trolling</i>, in the which they shall <i>cackle</i>, <i>fabed</i> are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never <i>parkered</i> suck.
    </li>
    <li>Then shall they begin to <i>cackle</i> to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.
    </li>
    <li>For if they do these <i>fakements</i> in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?
    </li>
    <li>And there were also <i>dewey</i> other, malefactors, led with <i>her</i> to be put to <i>carking it</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when they were <i>troll</i> to the place, which is <i>screeched</i> Calvary, there they crucified <i>her</i>, and the malefactors, <i>una</i> on the <i>sweet martini</i>, and the other on the <i>dry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> <i>Josie</i>, <i>Auntie</i>, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted <i>her</i> <i>clobber</i>, and cast lots.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>homies and palones</i> stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>she</i> saved others; let <i>her</i> save himself, if <i>she</i> be <i>Crystal</i>, the chosen of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>butch homies</i> also mocked <i>her</i>, <i>trolling</i> to <i>her</i>, and <i>parkering</i> <i>her</i> <i>alcopop</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackling</i>, If thou be the <i>dowriest homie</i> of the <i>kosher homies</i>, save thyself.
    </li>
    <li>And a superscription also was <i>screeved</i> over <i>her</i> in letters of Greek, and Latin, and <i>Kosher Homie</i>, THIS IS THE <i>dowriest homie</i> OF THE <i>kosher homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>una</i> of the malefactors which were hanged railed on <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, If thou be <i>Crystal</i>, save thyself and us.
    </li>
    <li>But the other answering rebuked <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Dost not thou fear <i>Gloria</i>, <i>vardaing</i> thou art in the same condemnation?
    </li>
    <li>And we indeed justly; for we <i>lall</i> the due <i>parkering</i> of our deeds: but this <i>homie</i> hath done <i>nishter</i> amiss.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Josie</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Josie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Verily I <i>cackle</i> unto thee, To <i>journo</i> shalt thou be with me in paradise.
    </li>
    <li>And it was about the <i>seyth</i> hour, and there was a <i>munge</i> over all the earth until the ninth hour.
    </li>
    <li>And the sun was <i>munged</i>, and the veil of the <i>holy carsey</i> was rent in the midst.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>Josie</i> had <i>screeched</i> with a loud <i>cackling fakement</i>, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>Auntie</i>, into thy <i>fambles</i> I commend my <i>Fairy</i>: and having <i>cackled</i> thus, <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> up the <i>fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now when the centurion <i>vardad</i> what was done, <i>she</i> glorified <i>Gloria</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>mais oui</i> this was a <i>bona</i> <i>homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And all the <i>homies and palones</i> that <i>trolled</i> together to that <i>vardaing</i>, beholding the <i>fakements</i> which were done, <i>slapped</i> their <i>foofs</i>, and <i>trolled back</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And all <i>her</i> acquaintance, and the <i>palones</i> that <i>trolled after</i> <i>her</i> from Galilee, stood <i>nishta ajax</i> off, beholding these <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, there was a <i>homie</i> named <i>Josephine</i>, a counsellor; and <i>she</i> was a <i>bona</i> <i>homie</i>, and a just:
    </li>
    <li>(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) <i>she</i> was of Arimathaea, a <i>smoke</i> of the <i>kosher homies</i>: who also himself waited for the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>This <i>homie</i> <i>trolled</i> unto Pilate, and begged the <i>lucoddy</i> of <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> it down, and wrapped it in <i>lycra</i>, and <i>laued</i> it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never <i>homie</i> before was <i>laued</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And that <i>journo</i> was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>palones</i> also, which <i>trolled</i> with <i>her</i> from Galilee, <i>trolled after</i> after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how <i>her</i> <i>lucoddy</i> was <i>laued</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>trolled back</i>, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath <i>journo</i> according to the <i>butch lav</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 24</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now upon the first <i>journo</i> of the week, <i>dowry</i> early in the morning, they <i>trolled</i> unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.
    </li>
    <li>And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.
    </li>
    <li>And they entered in, and found not the <i>lucoddy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, as they were <i>dowry</i> perplexed thereabout, <i>varda</i>, <i>dewey</i> <i>homies</i> stood by them in shining <i>frocks</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And as they were afraid, and bowed down their <i>ekes</i> to the earth, they <i>cackled</i> unto them, Why <i>charper</i> ye the living among the <i>stiff</i>?
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> is not here, but is risen: remember how <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto you when <i>she</i> was yet in Galilee,
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackling</i>, The <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> must be <i>laued</i> into the <i>fambles</i> of sinful <i>homies</i>, and be crucified, and the third <i>journo</i> rise again.
    </li>
    <li>And they remembered <i>her</i> <i>lavs</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>trolled back</i> from the sepulchre, and <i>cackled</i> all these <i>fakements</i> unto the <i>long dedger</i>, and to all the <i>lettie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other <i>palones</i> that were with them, which <i>cackled</i> these <i>fakements</i> unto the apostles.
    </li>
    <li>And their <i>lavs</i> seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.
    </li>
    <li>Then arose <i>Petra</i>, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, <i>she</i> beheld the <i>lycra</i> <i>zhoosh</i> <i>laued</i> by themselves, and <i>trolled off</i>, wondering in himself at that which was <i>troll</i> to pass.
    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, <i>dewey</i> of them <i>trolled</i> that same <i>journo</i> to a village <i>screeched</i> Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> furlongs.
    </li>
    <li>And they talked together of all these <i>fakements</i> which had happened.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, that, while they <i>dished the dirt</i> together and reasoned, <i>Josie</i> himself drew near, and <i>trolled</i> with them.
    </li>
    <li>But their <i>ogles</i> were holden that they should not know <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have <i>una</i> to another, as ye <i>mince</i>, and are sad?
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>una</i> of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the <i>fakements</i> which are <i>troll</i> to pass there in these days?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, What <i>fakements</i>? And they <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Concerning <i>Josie</i> of Nazareth, which was a prophet <i>dowry butch</i> in deed and <i>lav</i> before <i>Gloria</i> and all the <i>homies and palones</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And how the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homies</i> and our rulers <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> to be condemned to <i>carking it</i>, and have crucified <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But we trusted that it had been <i>she</i> which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to <i>journo</i> is the third <i>journo</i> since these <i>fakements</i> were done.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, and certain <i>palones</i> also of our company made us <i>gobsmacked</i>, which were early at the sepulchre;
    </li>
    <li>And when they found not <i>her</i> <i>lucoddy</i>, they <i>trolled</i>, <i>cackling</i>, that they had also <i>vardad</i> a vision of <i>fairies</i>, which <i>cackled</i> that <i>she</i> was alive.
    </li>
    <li>And certain of them which were with us <i>trolled</i> to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the <i>palones</i> had <i>cackled</i>: but <i>her</i> they <i>vardad</i> not.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, O fools, and slow of <i>thumping cheat</i> to believe all that the prophets have <i>cackled</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Ought not <i>Crystal</i> to have suffered these <i>fakements</i>, and to enter into <i>her</i> <i>fabeness</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And beginning at <i>Maureen</i> and all the prophets, <i>she</i> expounded unto them in all the <i>glossies</i> the <i>fakements</i> concerning himself.
    </li>
    <li>And they drew <i>ajax</i> unto the village, whither they <i>trolled</i>: and <i>she</i> made as though <i>she</i> would have <i>trolled</i> further.
    </li>
    <li>But they constrained <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>lett</i> with us: for it is toward <i>bijou nochy</i>, and the <i>journo</i> is far spent. And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> in to tarry with them.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, as <i>she</i> sat at <i>carnish</i> with them, <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> <i>pannan</i>, and <i>fabed</i> it, and brake, and <i>parkered</i> to them.
    </li>
    <li>And their <i>ogles</i> were opened, and they knew <i>her</i>; and <i>she</i> vanished out of their <i>vardaing</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>cackled</i> <i>una</i> to another, Did not our <i>thumping cheat</i> burn within us, while <i>she</i> talked with us by the way, and while <i>she</i> opened to us the <i>glossies</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And they rose up the same hour, and <i>trolled back to</i> Jerusalem, and found the <i>long dedger</i> gathered together, and them that were with them,
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackling</i>, The <i>Duchess</i> is risen indeed, and hath appeared to <i>Simone</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>cackled</i> what <i>fakements</i> were done in the way, and how <i>she</i> was known of them in breaking of <i>pannan</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And as they thus <i>cackled</i>, <i>Josie</i> himself stood in the midst of them, and <i>cackleth</i> unto them, Peace be unto you.
    </li>
    <li>But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had <i>vardad</i> a <i>Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your <i>thumping cheats</i>?
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i> my <i>fambles</i> and my <i>plates</i>, that it is I myself: handle me, and <i>varda</i>; for a <i>Fairy</i> hath not flesh and bones, as ye <i>varda</i> me have.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> had thus <i>cackled</i>, <i>she</i> shewed them <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i> and <i>her</i> <i>plates</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Have ye here any <i>carnish</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> it, and did <i>jarry</i> before them.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, These are the <i>lavs</i> which I <i>cackled</i> unto you, while I was yet with you, that all <i>fakements</i> must be fulfilled, which were <i>screeved</i> in the law of <i>Maureen</i>, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.
    </li>
    <li>Then opened <i>she</i> their understanding, that they might understand the <i>glossies</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackled</i> unto them, Thus it is <i>screeved</i>, and thus it behoved <i>Crystal</i> to suffer, and to rise from the <i>stiff</i> the third <i>journo</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And that repentance and remission of <i>kertervers</i> should be <i>cackled</i> in <i>her</i> name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And ye are witnesses of these <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, I <i>lau</i> the promise of my <i>Auntie</i> upon you: but tarry ye in the <i>smoke</i> of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> led them out as far as to Bethany, and <i>she</i> lifted up <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i>, and <i>fabed</i> them.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, while <i>she</i> <i>fabed</i> them, <i>she</i> was parted from them, and <i>lelled</i> up into heaven.
    </li>
    <li>And they worshipped <i>her</i>, and <i>trolled back to</i> Jerusalem with <i>dowry</i> joy:
    </li>
    <li>And were continually in the <i>holy carsey</i>, praising and <i>bona lav</i> <i>Gloria</i>. <i>Larlou</i>.
