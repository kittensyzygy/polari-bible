    <h1>Revelation</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>The Revelation of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, which <i>Gloria</i> <i>parkered</i> unto <i>her</i>, to shew unto <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i> <i>fakements</i> which must shortly <i>troll</i> to pass; and <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> and signified it by <i>her</i> <i>fairy</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i> <i>Jane</i>:
  </li>
  <li>Who bare record of the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and of the testimony of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, and of all <i>fakements</i> that <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i>.
  </li>
  <li><i>Fabed</i> is <i>she</i> that <i>vardaeth the lavs</i>, and they that <i>aunt nell</i> the <i>lavs</i> of this prophecy, and keep those <i>fakements</i> which are <i>screeved</i> therein: for the time is at <i>famble</i>.
  </li>
  <li><i>Jane</i> to the <i>setter</i> <i>meshigener carseys</i> which are in Asia: <i>gracie</i> be unto you, and peace, from <i>her</i> which is, and which was, and which is to <i>troll</i>; and from the <i>setter</i> <i>fairies</i> which are before <i>her</i> throne;
  </li>
  <li>And from <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, who is the <i>fabulous</i> <i>varda-ing fakement</i>, and the first begotten of the <i>stiff</i>, and the <i>princess</i> of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of the earth. Unto <i>her</i> that loved us, and <i>dhobied</i> us from our <i>kertervers</i> in <i>her</i> own blood,
  </li>
  <li>And hath made us <i>dowriest homies</i> and <i>godly homies</i> unto <i>Gloria</i> and <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>; to <i>her</i> be <i>fabeness</i> and dominion for ever and ever. <i>Larlou</i>.
  </li>
  <li><i>Varda</i>, <i>she</i> <i>trolleth</i> with clouds; and every <i>ogle</i> shall <i>varda</i> <i>her</i>, and they also which pierced <i>her</i>: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of <i>her</i>. Even so, <i>Larlou</i>.
  </li>
  <li>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, which is, and which was, and which is to <i>troll</i>, the <i>Dowry butch</i>.
  </li>
  <li>I <i>Jane</i>, who also am your <i>sister</i>, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, was in the isle that is <i>screeched</i> Patmos, for the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and for the testimony of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>.
  </li>
  <li>I was in the <i>Fairy</i> on the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s <i>journo</i>, and <i>aunt nelled</i> behind me a <i>dowry</i> <i>cackling fakement</i>, as of a <i>tooting fakement</i>,
  </li>
  <li><i>Cackling</i>, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou <i>vardest</i>, <i>screeve</i> in a <i>glossy</i>, and <i>lau</i> it unto the <i>setter</i> <i>meshigener carseys</i> which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.
  </li>
  <li>And I turned to <i>varda</i> the <i>cackling fakement</i> that <i>cackled</i> with me. And being turned, I <i>vardad</i> <i>setter</i> golden candlesticks;
  </li>
  <li>And in the midst of the <i>setter</i> candlesticks <i>una</i> like unto the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, clothed with a <i>frock</i> down to the <i>plate</i>, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.
  </li>
  <li><i>Her</i> <i>eke</i> and <i>her</i> <i>riah</i> were white like wool, as white as snow; and <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i> were as a flame of <i>binco fakement</i>;
  </li>
  <li>And <i>her</i> <i>plates</i> like unto <i>bona</i> brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and <i>her</i> <i>cackling fakement</i> as the sound of many <i>aquas</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>she</i> had in <i>her</i> <i>sweet martini</i> <i>setter</i> <i>twinkling fakements</i>: and out of <i>her</i> <i>screech</i> <i>trolled</i> a sharp twoedged <i>dowry efink</i>: and <i>her</i> countenance was as the sun shineth in <i>her</i> <i>butchness</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And when I <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i>, I fell at <i>her</i> <i>plates</i> as <i>stiff</i>. And <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> <i>sweet martini</i> upon me, <i>cackling</i> unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:
  </li>
  <li>I am <i>she</i> that <i>letteth</i>, and was <i>stiff</i>; and, <i>varda</i>, I am alive for evermore, <i>Larlou</i>; and have the keys of hell and of <i>carking it</i>.
  </li>
  <li><i>Screeve</i> the <i>fakements</i> which thou hast <i>vardad</i>, and the <i>fakements</i> which are, and the <i>fakements</i> which shall be hereafter;
  </li>
  <li>The mystery of the <i>setter</i> <i>twinkling fakements</i> which thou sawest in my <i>sweet martini</i>, and the <i>setter</i> golden candlesticks. The <i>setter</i> <i>twinkling fakements</i> are the <i>fairies</i> of the <i>setter</i> <i>meshigener carseys</i>: and the <i>setter</i> candlesticks which thou sawest are the <i>setter</i> <i>meshigener carseys</i>.
  </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>Unto the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>meshigener carsey</i> of Ephesus <i>screeve</i>; These <i>fakements</i> <i>cackleth</i> <i>she</i> that holdeth the <i>setter</i> <i>twinkling fakements</i> in <i>her</i> <i>sweet martini</i>, who <i>minceth</i> in the midst of the <i>setter</i> golden candlesticks;
  </li>
  <li><i>I&#8217;ve got your number, ducky</i>, and thy <i>acting dickey</i>, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are <i>nana</i>: and thou hast tried them which <i>cackle</i> they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:
  </li>
  <li>And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name&#8217;s sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.
  </li>
  <li><i>Any road up</i> I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast <i>dry</i> thy first love.
  </li>
  <li>Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will <i>troll</i> unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of <i>her</i> place, except thou repent.
  </li>
  <li>But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.
  </li>
  <li><i>She</i> that hath an <i>aunt nelling cheat</i>, let <i>her</i> <i>aunt nell</i> what the <i>Fairy</i> <i>cackleth</i> unto the <i>meshigener carseys</i>; To <i>her</i> that overcometh will I <i>parker</i> to <i>jarry</i> of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of <i>Gloria</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And unto the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>meshigener carsey</i> in Smyrna <i>screeve</i>; These <i>fakements</i> <i>cackleth</i> the first and the last, which was <i>stiff</i>, and is alive;
  </li>
  <li><i>I&#8217;ve got your number, ducky</i>, and tribulation, and <i>nishta dinarly</i>, (but thou art rich) and I know the <i>billingsgate</i> of them which <i>cackle</i> they are <i>kosher homies</i>, and are not, but are the synagogue of <i>Sadie</i>.
  </li>
  <li>Fear none of those <i>fakements</i> which thou shalt suffer: <i>varda</i>, the devil shall cast some of you into <i>charpering carsey</i>, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation <i>dacha</i> days: be thou <i>fabulous</i> unto <i>carking it</i>, and I will <i>parker</i> thee a <i>mudge</i> of life.
  </li>
  <li><i>She</i> that hath an <i>aunt nelling cheat</i>, let <i>her</i> <i>aunt nell</i> what the <i>Fairy</i> <i>cackleth</i> unto the <i>meshigener carseys</i>; <i>she</i> that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second <i>carking it</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And to the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>meshigener carsey</i> in Pergamos <i>screeve</i>; These <i>fakements</i> <i>cackleth</i> <i>she</i> which hath the sharp <i>dowry efink</i> with <i>dewey</i> edges;
  </li>
  <li><i>I&#8217;ve got your number, ducky</i>, and where thou dwellest, even where <i>Sadie</i>&#8216;s seat is: and thou holdest <i>nishta manjarry</i> my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my <i>fabulous</i> martyr, who was <i>ferricadoozed</i> among you, where <i>Sadie</i> <i>letteth</i>.
  </li>
  <li>But I have a <i>nishta dowry</i> <i>fakements</i> against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, to <i>jarry</i> <i>fakements</i> sacrificed unto idols, and to commit <i>charvering</i>.
  </li>
  <li>So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes, which <i>fakement</i> I hate.
  </li>
  <li>Repent; or else I will <i>troll</i> unto thee quickly, and will <i>palaver</i> against them with the <i>dowry efink</i> of my <i>screech</i>.
  </li>
  <li><i>She</i> that hath an <i>aunt nelling cheat</i>, let <i>her</i> <i>aunt nell</i> what the <i>Fairy</i> <i>cackleth</i> unto the <i>meshigener carseys</i>; To <i>her</i> that overcometh will I <i>parker</i> to <i>jarry</i> of the hidden <i>pannan</i>, and will <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> a white stone, and in the stone a new name <i>screeved</i>, which no <i>homie</i> knoweth saving <i>she</i> that receiveth it.
  </li>
  <li>And unto the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>meshigener carsey</i> in Thyatira <i>screeve</i>; These <i>fakements</i> <i>cackleth</i> the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, who hath <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i> like unto a flame of <i>binco fakement</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>plates</i> are like <i>bona</i> brass;
  </li>
  <li><i>I&#8217;ve got your number, ducky</i>, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first.
  </li>
  <li>Notwithstanding I have a <i>nishta dowry</i> <i>fakements</i> against thee, because thou sufferest that <i>palone</i> Jezebel, which <i>screecheth</i> herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my <i>serving homies</i> to commit <i>charvering</i>, and to <i>jarry</i> <i>fakements</i> sacrificed unto idols.
  </li>
  <li>And I <i>parkered</i> her space to repent of her <i>charvering</i>; and she repented not.
  </li>
  <li><i>Varda</i>, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into <i>dowry</i> tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.
  </li>
  <li>And I will <i>ferricadoza</i> her <i>chavvies</i> with <i>carking it</i>; and all the <i>meshigener carseys</i> shall know that I am <i>she</i> which searcheth the reins and <i>thumping cheats</i>: and I will <i>parker</i> unto every <i>una</i> of you according to your works.
  </li>
  <li>But unto you I <i>cackle</i>, and unto the <i>lettie</i> in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of <i>Sadie</i>, as they <i>cackle</i>; I will put upon you none other burden.
  </li>
  <li>But that which ye have already hold <i>nishta manjarry</i> till I <i>troll</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>she</i> that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to <i>her</i> will I <i>parker</i> power over the nations:
  </li>
  <li>And <i>she</i> shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the <i>fakements</i> of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I <i>lalled</i> of my <i>Auntie</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And I will <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> the morning <i>twinkling fakement</i>.
  </li>
  <li><i>She</i> that hath an <i>aunt nelling cheat</i>, let <i>her</i> <i>aunt nell</i> what the <i>Fairy</i> <i>cackleth</i> unto the <i>meshigener carseys</i>.
  </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>And unto the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>meshigener carsey</i> in Sardis <i>screeve</i>; These <i>fakements</i> <i>cackleth</i> <i>she</i> that hath the <i>setter</i> <i>fairies</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and the <i>setter</i> <i>twinkling fakements</i>; <i>I&#8217;ve got your number, ducky</i>, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art <i>stiff</i>.
  </li>
  <li>Be watchful, and strengthen the <i>fakements</i> which remain, that are ready to <i>cark it</i>: for I have not found thy works <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i> before <i>Gloria</i>.
  </li>
  <li>Remember therefore how thou hast <i>lalled</i> and <i>aunt nelled</i>, and hold <i>nishta manjarry</i>, and repent. If therefore <i>nishta</i> <i>varda</i>, I will <i>troll</i> on thee as a <i>sharpering homie</i>, and <i>nishta</i> know what hour I will <i>troll</i> upon thee.
  </li>
  <li>Thou hast a <i>nishta dowry</i> names even in Sardis which have not defiled their <i>frocks</i>; and they shall <i>mince</i> with me in white: for they are <i>bona</i>.
  </li>
  <li><i>She</i> that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white <i>clobber</i>; and I will not blot out <i>her</i> name out of the <i>glossy</i> of life, but I will <i>dish</i> <i>her</i> name before my <i>Auntie</i>, and before <i>her</i> <i>fairies</i>.
  </li>
  <li><i>She</i> that hath an <i>aunt nelling cheat</i>, let <i>her</i> <i>aunt nell</i> what the <i>Fairy</i> <i>cackleth</i> unto the <i>meshigener carseys</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And to the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>meshigener carsey</i> in Philadelphia <i>screeve</i>; These <i>fakements</i> <i>cackleth</i> <i>she</i> that is <i>fabulosa</i>, <i>she</i> that is true, <i>she</i> that hath the key of <i>Davina</i>, <i>she</i> that openeth, and no <i>homie</i> shutteth; and shutteth, and no <i>homie</i> openeth;
  </li>
  <li><i>I&#8217;ve got your number, ducky</i>: <i>varda</i>, I have set before thee an open door, and no <i>homie</i> can shut it: for thou hast a <i>bijou</i> <i>butchness</i>, and hast kept my <i>lav</i>, and hast not denied my name.
  </li>
  <li><i>Varda</i>, I will make them of the synagogue of <i>Sadie</i>, which <i>cackle</i> they are <i>kosher homies</i>, and are not, but do lie; <i>varda</i>, I will make them to <i>troll</i> and worship before thy <i>plates</i>, and to know that I have loved thee.
  </li>
  <li>Because thou hast kept the <i>lav</i> of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall <i>troll</i> upon all the world, to try them that <i>lett</i> upon the earth.
  </li>
  <li><i>Varda</i>, I <i>troll</i> quickly: hold that <i>nishta manjarry</i> which thou hast, that no <i>homie</i> <i>lell</i> thy <i>mudge</i>.
  </li>
  <li><i>Her</i> that overcometh will I make a pillar in the <i>holy carsey</i> of my <i>Gloria</i>, and <i>she</i> shall <i>troll</i> <i>nishta</i> out: and I will <i>screeve</i> upon <i>her</i> the name of my <i>Gloria</i>, and the name of the <i>smoke</i> of my <i>Gloria</i>, which is new Jerusalem, which <i>trolleth</i> down out of heaven from my <i>Gloria</i>: and I will <i>screeve</i> upon <i>her</i> my new name.
  </li>
  <li><i>She</i> that hath an <i>aunt nelling cheat</i>, let <i>her</i> <i>aunt nell</i> what the <i>Fairy</i> <i>cackleth</i> unto the <i>meshigener carseys</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And unto the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>meshigener carsey</i> of the Laodiceans <i>screeve</i>; These <i>fakements</i> <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Larlou</i>, the <i>fabulous</i> and true <i>varda-ing fakement</i>, the beginning of the creation of <i>Gloria</i>;
  </li>
  <li><i>I&#8217;ve got your number, ducky</i>, that thou art <i>nishta</i> cold <i>nishta</i> hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.
  </li>
  <li>So then because thou art lukewarm, and <i>nishta</i> cold <i>nishta</i> hot, I will spue thee out of my <i>screech</i>.
  </li>
  <li>Because thou <i>cackleth</i>, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of <i>nishter</i>; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and <i>nanti dinarly</i>, and <i>nanti varda</i>, and <i>nanti zhoosh</i>:
  </li>
  <li>I counsel thee to buy of me <i>gelt</i> tried in the <i>binco fakement</i>, that thou mayest be rich; and white <i>clobber</i>, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the <i>scharda</i> of thy <i>nanti zhoosh</i> <i>nix</i> appear; and anoint thine <i>ogles</i> with eyesalve, that thou mayest <i>varda</i>.
  </li>
  <li>As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.
  </li>
  <li><i>Varda</i>, I stand at the door, and knock: if any <i>homie</i> <i>aunt nell</i> my <i>cackling fakement</i>, and open the door, I will <i>troll</i> in to <i>her</i>, and will <i>bevvy</i> with <i>her</i>, and <i>she</i> with me.
  </li>
  <li>To <i>her</i> that overcometh will I grant to <i>lett</i> with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my <i>Auntie</i> in <i>her</i> throne.
  </li>
  <li><i>She</i> that hath an <i>aunt nelling cheat</i>, let <i>her</i> <i>aunt nell</i> what the <i>Fairy</i> <i>cackleth</i> unto the <i>meshigener carseys</i>.
  </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>After this I looked, and, <i>varda</i>, a door was opened in heaven: and the first <i>cackling fakement</i> which I <i>aunt nelled</i> was as it were of a <i>tooting fakement</i> talking with me; which <i>cackled</i>, <i>troll</i> up hither, and I will shew thee <i>fakements</i> which must be hereafter.
  </li>
  <li>And immediately I was in the <i>Fairy</i>: and, <i>varda</i>, a throne was set in heaven, and <i>una</i> sat on the throne.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>she</i> that sat was to <i>varda</i> upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in <i>vardaing</i> like unto an emerald.
  </li>
  <li>And round about the throne were <i>quarter</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i> seats: and upon the seats I <i>vardad</i> <i>quarter</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i> <i>fungi</i> sitting, clothed in white <i>clobber</i>; and they had on their <i>ekes</i> crowns of <i>gelt</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and there were <i>setter</i> <i>bincos</i> of <i>binco fakement</i> burning before the throne, which are the <i>setter</i> <i>fairies</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were <i>quarter</i> beasts full of <i>ogles</i> before and behind.
  </li>
  <li>And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a <i>eke</i> as a <i>homie</i>, and the <i>quarter</i> beast was like a flying eagle.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>quarter</i> beasts had each of them <i>sey</i> wings about <i>her</i>; and they were full of <i>ogles</i> within: and they <i>lettie</i> not <i>journo</i> and <i>nochy</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>fabulosa</i>, <i>fabulosa</i>, <i>fabulosa</i>, <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> <i>Dowry butch</i>, which was, and is, and is to <i>troll</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And when those beasts <i>parker</i> <i>fabeness</i> and honour and thanks to <i>her</i> that sat on the throne, who <i>letteth</i> for ever and ever,
  </li>
  <li>The <i>quarter</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i> <i>fungi</i> fall down before <i>her</i> that sat on the throne, and worship <i>her</i> that <i>letteth</i> for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, <i>cackling</i>,
  </li>
  <li>Thou art <i>bona</i>, O <i>Duchess</i>, to <i>lall</i> <i>fabeness</i> and honour and power: for thou hast created all <i>fakements</i>, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.
  </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>And I <i>vardad</i> in the <i>sweet martini</i> of <i>her</i> that sat on the throne a <i>glossy</i> <i>screeved</i> within and on the backside, sealed with <i>setter</i> seals.
  </li>
  <li>And I <i>vardad</i> a <i>butch</i> <i>fairy</i> proclaiming with a loud <i>cackling fakement</i>, Who is <i>bona</i> to open the <i>glossy</i>, and to loose the seals thereof?
  </li>
  <li>And no <i>homie</i> in heaven, <i>nishta</i> in earth, <i>nishta</i> under the earth, was able to open the <i>glossy</i>, <i>nishta</i> to <i>varda</i> thereon.
  </li>
  <li>And I <i>parnied</i> <i>dowry</i>, because no <i>homie</i> was found <i>bona</i> to open and to <i>varda the lavs</i> the <i>glossy</i>, <i>nishta</i> to <i>varda</i> thereon.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>una</i> of the <i>fungi</i> <i>cackleth</i> unto me, <i>parnie</i> not: <i>varda</i>, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of <i>Davina</i>, hath prevailed to open the <i>glossy</i>, and to loose the <i>setter</i> seals thereof.
  </li>
  <li>And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the <i>quarter</i> beasts, and in the midst of the <i>fungi</i>, stood a Lamb as it had been <i>ferricadoozed</i>, having <i>setter</i> <i>colins</i> and <i>setter</i> <i>ogles</i>, which are the <i>setter</i> <i>fairies</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>laued</i> forth into all the earth.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> and <i>lelled</i> the <i>glossy</i> out of the <i>sweet martini</i> of <i>her</i> that sat upon the throne.
  </li>
  <li>And when <i>she</i> had <i>lelled</i> the <i>glossy</i>, the <i>quarter</i> beasts and <i>quarter</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i> <i>fungi</i> fell down before the Lamb, having every <i>una</i> of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the <i>meshigener mutterings</i> of saints.
  </li>
  <li>And they sung a new <i>chant</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Thou art <i>bona</i> to <i>lell</i> the <i>glossy</i>, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast <i>ferricadoozed</i>, and hast redeemed us to <i>Gloria</i> by thy blood out of every kindred, and <i>polari</i>, and <i>homies and palones</i>, and nation;
  </li>
  <li>And hast made us unto our <i>Gloria</i> <i>dowriest homies</i> and <i>godly homies</i>: and we shall reign on the earth.
  </li>
  <li>And I beheld, and I <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>cackling fakement</i> of many <i>fairies</i> round about the throne and the beasts and the <i>fungi</i>: and the number of them was <i>dacha</i> <i>mille</i> times <i>dacha</i> <i>mille</i>, and <i>milles</i> of <i>milles</i>;
  </li>
  <li><i>Cackling</i> with a loud <i>cackling fakement</i>, <i>bona</i> is the Lamb that was <i>ferricadoozed</i> to <i>lall</i> power, and riches, and wisdom, and <i>butchness</i>, and honour, and <i>fabeness</i>, and <i>bona lav</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, <i>aunt nelled</i> I <i>cackling</i>, <i>bona lav</i>, and honour, and <i>fabeness</i>, and power, be unto <i>her</i> that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>quarter</i> beasts <i>cackled</i>, <i>Larlou</i>. And the <i>quarter</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i> <i>fungi</i> fell down and worshipped <i>her</i> that <i>letteth</i> for ever and ever.
  </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>And I <i>vardad</i> when the Lamb opened <i>una</i> of the seals, and I <i>aunt nelled</i>, as it were the <i>screech</i> of thunder, <i>una</i> of the <i>quarter</i> beasts <i>cackling</i>, <i>troll</i> and <i>varda</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And I <i>vardad</i>, and <i>varda</i> a white horse: and <i>she</i> that sat on <i>her</i> had a bow; and a <i>mudge</i> was <i>parkered</i> unto <i>her</i>: and <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> forth conquering, and to conquer.
  </li>
  <li>And when <i>she</i> had opened the second seal, I <i>aunt nelled</i> the second beast <i>cackle</i>, <i>troll</i> and <i>varda</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And there <i>trolled</i> out another horse that was red: and power was <i>parkered</i> to <i>her</i> that sat thereon to <i>lell</i> peace from the earth, and that they should <i>ferricadoza</i> <i>una</i> another: and there was <i>parkered</i> unto <i>her</i> a <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry efink</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And when <i>she</i> had opened the third seal, I <i>aunt nelled</i> the third beast <i>cackle</i>, <i>troll</i> and <i>varda</i>. And I beheld, and lo a <i>goolie</i> horse; and <i>she</i> that sat on <i>her</i> had a pair of balances in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And I <i>aunt nelled</i> a <i>cackling fakement</i> in the midst of the <i>quarter</i> beasts <i>cackle</i>, A measure of wheat for a penny, and <i>trey</i> measures of barley for a penny; and <i>varda</i> thou hurt not the <i>lube</i> and the <i>sherry</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And when <i>she</i> had opened the <i>quarter</i> seal, I <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>cackling fakement</i> of the <i>quarter</i> beast <i>cackle</i>, <i>troll</i> and <i>varda</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And I looked, and <i>varda</i> a pale horse: and <i>her</i> name that sat on <i>her</i> was <i>carking it</i>, and Hell <i>trolled after</i> with <i>her</i>. And power was <i>parkered</i> unto them over the <i>quarter</i> part of the earth, to <i>ferricadoza</i> with <i>dowry efink</i>, and with hunger, and with <i>carking it</i>, and with the beasts of the earth.
  </li>
  <li>And when <i>she</i> had opened the fifth seal, I <i>vardad</i> under the <i>grovelling fakement</i> the <i>nishta lucoddies</i> of them that were <i>ferricadoozed</i> for the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and for the testimony which they held:
  </li>
  <li>And they <i>screeched</i> with a loud <i>cackling fakement</i>, <i>cackling</i>, How long, O <i>Duchess</i>, <i>fabulosa</i> and true, dost thou not <i>beak</i> and <i>do the rights</i> our blood on them that <i>lett</i> on the earth?
  </li>
  <li>And white <i>frocks</i> were <i>parkered</i> unto every <i>una</i> of them; and it was <i>cackled</i> unto them, that they should <i>lettie</i> yet for a <i>bijou</i> season, until their fellowservants also and their <i>sisters</i>, that should be <i>ferricadozad</i> as they were, should be fulfilled.
  </li>
  <li>And I beheld when <i>she</i> had opened the <i>seyth</i> seal, and, lo, there was a <i>dowry</i> earthquake; and the sun became <i>goolie</i> as <i>nylon</i> of <i>riah</i>, and the moon became as blood;
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>twinkling fakements</i> of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a <i>dowry butch</i> wind.
  </li>
  <li>And the heaven <i>trolled off</i> as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were <i>trolled</i> out of their places.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>dowriest homies</i> of the earth, and the <i>dowry</i> <i>homies</i>, and the rich <i>homies</i>, and the <i>dowriest</i> captains, and the <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i>, and every <i>bond homie</i>, and every free <i>homie</i>, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;
  </li>
  <li>And <i>cackled</i> to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the <i>eke</i> of <i>her</i> that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:
  </li>
  <li>For the <i>dowry</i> <i>journo</i> of <i>her</i> wrath is <i>troll</i>; and who shall be able to stand?

  <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>And after these <i>fakements</i> I <i>vardad</i> <i>quarter</i> <i>fairies</i> standing on the <i>quarter</i> corners of the earth, holding the <i>quarter</i> winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, <i>nishta</i> on the sea, <i>nishta</i> on any tree.
  </li>
  <li>And I <i>vardad</i> another <i>fairy</i> <i>trolling up</i> from the east, having the seal of the living <i>Gloria</i>: and <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> with a loud <i>cackling fakement</i> to the <i>quarter</i> <i>fairies</i>, to whom it was <i>parkered</i> to hurt the earth and the sea,
  </li>
  <li><i>Cackling</i>, Hurt not the earth, <i>nishta</i> the sea, <i>nishta</i> the trees, till we have sealed the <i>serving homies</i> of our <i>Gloria</i> in their foreheads.
  </li>
  <li>And I <i>aunt nelled</i> the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an <i>chenter</i> and <i>quarter dacha</i> and <i>quarter</i> <i>mille</i> of all the tribes of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel.
  </li>
  <li>Of the tribe of Juda were sealed <i>kenza</i> <i>mille</i>. Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed <i>kenza</i> <i>mille</i>. Of the tribe of Gad were sealed <i>kenza</i> <i>mille</i>.

  <li>Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed <i>kenza</i> <i>mille</i>. Of the tribe of <i>Josephine</i> were sealed <i>kenza</i> <i>mille</i>. Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed <i>kenza</i> <i>mille</i>.
  </li>
  <li>After this I beheld, and, lo, a <i>dowry</i> multitude, which no <i>homie</i> could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and <i>homies and palones</i>, and <i>polaris</i>, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white <i>frocks</i>, and palms in their <i>fambles</i>;
  </li>
  <li>And <i>screeched</i> with a loud <i>cackling fakement</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Salvation to our <i>Gloria</i> which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.
  </li>
  <li>And all the <i>fairies</i> stood round about the throne, and about the <i>fungi</i> and the <i>quarter</i> beasts, and fell before the throne on their <i>ekes</i>, and worshipped <i>Gloria</i>,

  <li><i>Cackling</i>, <i>Larlou</i>: <i>bona lav</i>, and <i>fabeness</i>, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our <i>Gloria</i> for ever and ever. <i>Larlou</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>una</i> of the <i>fungi</i> answered, <i>cackling</i> unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white <i>frocks</i>? and whence <i>trolled</i> they?
  </li>
  <li>And I <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Sir, thou knowest. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> to me, These are they which <i>trolled</i> out of <i>dowry</i> tribulation, and have <i>dhobied</i> their <i>frocks</i>, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
  </li>
  <li>Therefore are they before the throne of <i>Gloria</i>, and serve <i>her</i> <i>journo</i> and <i>nochy</i> in <i>her</i> <i>holy carsey</i>: and <i>she</i> that sitteth on the throne shall <i>lett</i> among them.

  <li>They shall hunger <i>nishta</i>, <i>nishta</i> thirst any more; <i>nishta</i> shall the sun <i>sparkle</i> on them, <i>nishta</i> any heat.
  </li>
  <li>For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of <i>aquas</i>: and <i>Gloria</i> shall wipe away all tears from their <i>ogles</i>.

  <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>And when <i>she</i> had opened the <i>setterth</i> seal, there was <i>nishta cackle</i> in heaven about the space of half an hour.
  </li>
  <li>And I <i>vardad</i> the <i>setter</i> <i>fairies</i> which stood before <i>Gloria</i>; and to them were <i>parkered</i> <i>setter</i> trumpets.
  </li>
  <li>And another <i>fairy</i> <i>trolled</i> and stood at the <i>grovelling fakement</i>, having a golden censer; and there was <i>parkered</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>dowry</i> <i>smelly</i>, that <i>she</i> should offer it with the <i>meshigener mutterings</i> of all saints upon the golden <i>grovelling fakement</i> which was before the throne.
  </li>
  <li>And the smoke of the <i>smelly</i>, which <i>trolled</i> with the <i>meshigener mutterings</i> of the saints, <i>trolled up</i> up before <i>Gloria</i> out of the <i>fairy</i>&#8216;s <i>famble</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>fairy</i> <i>lelled</i> the censer, and filled it with <i>binco fakement</i> of the <i>grovelling fakement</i>, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>setter</i> <i>fairies</i> which had the <i>setter</i> trumpets prepared themselves to sound.
  </li>
  <li>The first <i>fairy</i> sounded, and there <i>trolled after</i> hail and <i>binco fakement</i> mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.
  </li>
  <li>And the second <i>fairy</i> sounded, and as it were a <i>dowry</i> mountain burning with <i>binco fakement</i> was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;
  </li>
  <li>And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, <i>carked it</i>; and the third part of the <i>latties on water</i> were <i>battyfanged</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And the third <i>fairy</i> sounded, and there fell a <i>dowry</i> <i>twinkling fakement</i> from heaven, burning as it were a <i>binco</i>, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of <i>aquas</i>;
  </li>
  <li>And the name of the <i>twinkling fakement</i> is <i>screeched</i> Wormwood: and the third part of the <i>aquas</i> became wormwood; and many <i>homies</i> <i>carked it</i> of the <i>aquas</i>, because they were made bitter.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>quarter</i> <i>fairy</i> sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the <i>twinkling fakements</i>; so as the third part of them was <i>munged</i>, and the <i>journo</i> shone not for a third part of it, and the <i>nochy</i> likewise.
  </li>
  <li>And I beheld, and <i>aunt nelled</i> an <i>fairy</i> flying through the midst of heaven, <i>cackling</i> with a loud <i>cackling fakement</i>, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the <i>tooting fakement</i> of the <i>trey</i> <i>fairies</i>, which are yet to sound!
  </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>And the fifth <i>fairy</i> sounded, and I <i>vardad</i> a <i>twinkling fakement</i> fall from heaven unto the earth: and to <i>her</i> was <i>parkered</i> the key of the bottomless pit.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>she</i> opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a <i>dowry</i> furnace; and the sun and the air were <i>munged</i> by reason of the smoke of the pit.
  </li>
  <li>And there <i>trolled</i> out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was <i>parkered</i> power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.
  </li>
  <li>And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, <i>nishta</i> any green <i>fakement</i>, <i>nishta</i> any tree; but only those <i>homies</i> which have not the seal of <i>Gloria</i> in their foreheads.
  </li>
  <li>And to them it was <i>parkered</i> that they should not <i>ferricadoza</i> them, but that they should be tormented <i>chinker</i> months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when <i>she</i> striketh a <i>homie</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And in those days shall <i>homies</i> <i>charper</i> <i>carking it</i>, and shall not find it; and shall <i>fancy</i> to <i>cark it</i>, and <i>carking it</i> shall <i>scarper</i> from them.
  </li>
  <li>And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their <i>ekes</i> were as it were crowns like <i>gelt</i>, and their <i>ekes</i> were as the <i>ekes</i> of <i>homies</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And they had <i>riah</i> as the <i>riah</i> of <i>palones</i>, and their <i>hampsteads</i> were as the <i>hampsteads</i> of lions.
  </li>
  <li>And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of <i>rattling coves</i> of many horses <i>trolling</i> to battle.
  </li>
  <li>And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt <i>homies</i> <i>chinker</i> months.
  </li>
  <li>And they had a <i>dowriest homie</i> over them, which is the <i>fairy</i> of the bottomless pit, whose name in the <i>Kosher Homie</i> <i>polari</i> is Abaddon, but in the Greek <i>polari</i> hath <i>her</i> name Apollyon.
  </li>
  <li><i>Una</i> woe is past; and, <i>varda</i>, there <i>troll</i> <i>dewey</i> woes more hereafter.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>seyth</i> <i>fairy</i> sounded, and I <i>aunt nelled</i> a <i>cackling fakement</i> from the <i>quarter</i> <i>colins</i> of the golden <i>grovelling fakement</i> which is before <i>Gloria</i>,
  </li>
  <li><i>Cackling</i> to the <i>seyth</i> <i>fairy</i> which had the <i>tooting fakement</i>, Loose the <i>quarter</i> <i>fairies</i> which are bound in the <i>dowry</i> river Euphrates.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>quarter</i> <i>fairies</i> were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a <i>journo</i>, and a month, and a year, for to <i>ferricadooza</i> the third part of <i>homies</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And the number of the army of the horsemen were <i>dewey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>mille</i> <i>mille</i>: and I <i>aunt nelled</i> the number of them.
  </li>
  <li>And thus I <i>vardad</i> the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of <i>binco fakement</i>, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the <i>ekes</i> of the horses were as the <i>ekes</i> of lions; and out of their <i>screeches</i> issued <i>binco fakement</i> and smoke and brimstone.
  </li>
  <li>By these <i>trey</i> was the third part of <i>homies</i> <i>ferricadozad</i>, by the <i>binco fakement</i>, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their <i>screeches</i>.
  </li>
  <li>For their power is in their <i>screech</i>, and in their tails: for their tails were like unto serpents, and had <i>ekes</i>, and with them they do hurt.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>lettie</i> of the <i>homies</i> which were not <i>ferricadozad</i> by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their <i>fambles</i>, that they should not worship devils, and idols of <i>gelt</i>, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which <i>nishta</i> can <i>varda</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>aunt nell</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>mince</i>:

  <li><i>Nishta</i> repented they of their murders, <i>nishta</i> of their sorceries, <i>nishta</i> of their <i>charvering</i>, <i>nishta</i> of their thefts.

  <h2>Chapter 10</h2>

  <li>And I <i>vardad</i> another <i>dowry butch</i> <i>fairy</i> <i>troll</i> down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> was as it were the sun, and <i>her</i> <i>plates</i> as pillars of <i>binco fakement</i>:
  </li>
  <li>And <i>she</i> had in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> a <i>bijou</i> <i>glossy</i> open: and <i>she</i> set <i>her</i> <i>sweet</i> <i>plate</i> upon the sea, and <i>her</i> <i>dry</i> <i>plate</i> on the earth,
  </li>
  <li>And <i>screeched</i> with a loud <i>cackling fakement</i>, as when a lion roareth: and when <i>she</i> had <i>screeched</i>, <i>setter</i> thunders uttered their voices.
  </li>
  <li>And when the <i>setter</i> thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to <i>screeve</i>: and I <i>aunt nelled</i> a <i>cackling fakement</i> from heaven <i>cackling</i> unto me, Seal up those <i>fakements</i> which the <i>setter</i> thunders uttered, and <i>screeve</i> them not.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>fairy</i> which I <i>vardad</i> stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> to heaven,
  </li>
  <li>And sware by <i>her</i> that <i>letteth</i> for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the <i>fakements</i> that therein are, and the earth, and the <i>fakements</i> that therein are, and the sea, and the <i>fakements</i> which are therein, that there should be time no longer:

  <li>But in the days of the <i>cackling fakement</i> of the <i>setterth</i> <i>fairy</i>, when <i>she</i> shall begin to sound, the mystery of <i>Gloria</i> should be finished, as <i>she</i> hath <i>screeched</i> to <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i> the prophets.

  <li>And the <i>cackling fakement</i> which I <i>aunt nelled</i> from heaven <i>cackled</i> unto me again, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>troll</i> and <i>lell</i> the <i>bijou</i> <i>glossy</i> which is open in the <i>famble</i> of the <i>fairy</i> which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.

  <li>And I <i>trolled</i> unto the <i>fairy</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>parker</i> me the <i>bijou</i> <i>glossy</i>.

  </li>
  <li>And I <i>lelled</i> the <i>bijou</i> <i>glossy</i> out of the <i>fairy</i>&#8216;s <i>famble</i>, and ate it up; and it was in my <i>screech</i> <i>bona</i> as honey: and as soon as I had <i>jarried</i> it, my belly was bitter.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and <i>polaris</i>, and <i>dowriest homies</i>.

  <h2>Chapter 11</h2>

  <li>And there was <i>parkered</i> me a reed like unto a rod: and the <i>fairy</i> stood, <i>cackling</i>, Rise, and measure the <i>holy carsey</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and the <i>grovelling fakement</i>, and them that worship therein.
  </li>
  <li>But the court which is <i>nanti</i> the <i>holy carsey</i> leave out, and measure it not; for it is <i>parkered</i> unto the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>: and the <i>fabulosa</i> <i>smoke</i> shall they <i>mince</i> under <i>plate</i> <i>quarter dacha</i> and <i>dewey</i> months.

  <li>And I will <i>parker</i> power unto my <i>dewey</i> witnesses, and they shall prophesy a <i>mille</i> <i>dewey</i> <i>chenter</i> and <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> days, clothed in <i>nylon</i>.

  <li>These are the <i>dewey</i> olive trees, and the <i>dewey</i> candlesticks standing before the <i>Gloria</i> of the earth.

  <li>And if any <i>homie</i> will hurt them, <i>binco fakement</i> proceedeth out of their <i>screech</i>, and devoureth their enemies: and if any <i>homie</i> will hurt them, <i>she</i> must in this manner be <i>ferricadozad</i>.

  <li>These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over <i>aquas</i> to turn them to blood, and to <i>slap</i> the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.

  <li>And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make <i>barney</i> against them, and shall overcome them, and <i>ferricadoza</i> them.

  <li>And their <i>stiff</i> bodies shall lie in the street of the <i>dowry</i> <i>smoke</i>, which spiritually is <i>screeched</i> Sodom and Egypt, where also our <i>Duchess</i> was crucified.

  <li>And <i>she</i> opened <i>her</i> <i>screech</i> in <i>billingsgate</i> against <i>Gloria</i>, to blaspheme <i>her</i> name, and <i>her</i> <i>bijou tabernaclette</i>, and them that <i>lett</i> in heaven.

  <li>And it was <i>parkered</i> unto <i>her</i> to make <i>barney</i> with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> over all kindreds, and <i>polaris</i>, and nations.
  </li>
  <li>And all that <i>lett</i> upon the earth shall worship <i>her</i>, whose names are not <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of life of the Lamb <i>ferricadoozed</i> from the foundation of the world.

  <li>If any <i>homie</i> have an <i>aunt nelling cheat</i>, let <i>her</i> <i>aunt nell</i>.

  </li>
  <li>And I beheld another beast <i>trolling</i> up out of the earth; and <i>she</i> had <i>dewey</i> <i>colins</i> like a lamb, and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> as a <i>drag queen</i>.

  <li>And <i>she</i> exerciseth all the power of the first beast before <i>her</i>, and causeth the earth and them which <i>lett</i> therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.

  <li>And <i>she</i> doeth <i>dowry</i> wonders, so that <i>she</i> maketh <i>binco fakement</i> <i>troll</i> down from heaven on the earth in the <i>vardaing</i> of <i>homies</i>,

  <li>And deceiveth them that <i>lett</i> on the earth by the means of those miracles which <i>she</i> had power to do in the <i>vardaing</i> of the beast; <i>cackling</i> to them that <i>lett</i> on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a <i>dowry efink</i>, and did live.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>she</i> had power to <i>parker</i> life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both <i>cackle</i>, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be <i>ferricadozad</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>she</i> causeth all, both <i>pogey</i> and <i>dowry</i>, rich and <i>nanti dinarly</i>, free and bond, to <i>lall</i> a <i>Marcia</i> in their <i>sweet martini</i>, or in their foreheads:
  </li>
  <li>And that no <i>homie</i> might buy or sell, save <i>she</i> that had the <i>Marcia</i>, or the name of the beast, or the number of <i>her</i> name.
  </li>
  <li>Here is wisdom. Let <i>her</i> that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a <i>homie</i>; and <i>her</i> number is <i>sey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> and <i>sey</i>.

  <h2>Chapter 14</h2>

  <li>And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with <i>her</i> an <i>chenter</i> <i>quarter dacha</i> and <i>quarter</i> <i>mille</i>, having <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s name <i>screeved</i> in their foreheads.
  </li>
  <li>And I <i>aunt nelled</i> a <i>cackling fakement</i> from heaven, as the <i>cackling fakement</i> of many <i>aquas</i>, and as the <i>cackling fakement</i> of a <i>dowry</i> thunder: and I <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>cackling fakement</i> of harpers harping with their harps:

  <li>And they sung as it were a new <i>chant</i> before the throne, and before the <i>quarter</i> beasts, and the <i>fungi</i>: and no <i>homie</i> could learn that <i>chant</i> but the <i>chenter</i> and <i>quarter dacha</i> and <i>quarter</i> <i>mille</i>, which were redeemed from the earth.
  </li>
  <li>These are they which were not defiled with <i>palones</i>; for they are <i>nanti charvers</i>. These are they which <i>troll after</i> the Lamb whithersoever <i>she</i> goeth. These were redeemed from among <i>homies</i>, being the firstfruits unto <i>Gloria</i> and to the Lamb.
  </li>
  <li>And in their <i>screech</i> was found no guile: for they are <i>nanti</i> fault before the throne of <i>Gloria</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And I <i>vardad</i> another <i>fairy</i> fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting <i>gossip</i> to <i>cackle</i> unto them that <i>lett</i> on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and <i>polari</i>, and <i>homies and palones</i>,

  <li>And there <i>trolled after</i> another <i>fairy</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that <i>dowry</i> <i>smoke</i>, because she made all nations <i>buvare</i> of the <i>sherry</i> of the wrath of her <i>charvering</i>.

  <li>And the third <i>fairy</i> <i>trolled after</i> them, <i>cackling</i> with a loud <i>cackling fakement</i>, If any <i>homie</i> worship the beast and <i>her</i> image, and <i>lall</i> <i>her</i> <i>Marcia</i> in <i>her</i> forehead, or in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>,

  <li>The same shall <i>buvare</i> of the <i>sherry</i> of the wrath of <i>Gloria</i>, which is poured out <i>nanti</i> mixture into the cup of <i>her</i> indignation; and <i>she</i> shall be tormented with <i>binco fakement</i> and brimstone in the presence of the <i>fabulosa</i> <i>fairies</i>, and in the presence of the Lamb:
  </li>
  <li>And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no <i>lettie</i> <i>journo</i> <i>nishta</i> <i>nochy</i>, who worship the beast and <i>her</i> image, and whosoever receiveth the <i>Marcia</i> of <i>her</i> name.
  </li>
  <li>Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the <i>butch lavs</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and the faith of <i>Josie</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And I <i>aunt nelled</i> a <i>cackling fakement</i> from heaven <i>cackling</i> unto me, <i>screeve</i>, <i>fabed</i> are the <i>stiff</i> which <i>cark it</i> in the <i>Duchess</i> from henceforth: <i>any road up</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Fairy</i>, that they may <i>lettie</i> from their <i>acting dickeys</i>; and their works do <i>troll after</i> them.
  </li>
  <li>And I looked, and <i>varda</i> a white cloud, and upon the cloud <i>una</i> sat like unto the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, having on <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> a golden <i>mudge</i>, and in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> a sharp sickle.
  </li>
  <li>And another <i>fairy</i> <i>trolled</i> out of the <i>holy carsey</i>, <i>screeching</i> with a loud <i>cackling fakement</i> to <i>her</i> that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is <i>troll</i> for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>she</i> that sat on the cloud thrust in <i>her</i> sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped.
  </li>
  <li>And another <i>fairy</i> <i>trolled</i> out of the <i>holy carsey</i> which is in heaven, <i>she</i> also having a sharp sickle.
  </li>
  <li>And another <i>fairy</i> <i>trolled</i> out from the <i>grovelling fakement</i>, which had power over <i>binco fakement</i>; and <i>screeched</i> with a loud <i>screech</i> to <i>her</i> that had the sharp sickle, <i>cackling</i>, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>fairy</i> thrust in <i>her</i> sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the <i>dowry</i> winepress of the wrath of <i>Gloria</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And the winepress was <i>minced</i> <i>nanti</i> the <i>smoke</i>, and blood <i>trolled</i> out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a <i>mille</i> and <i>sey</i> <i>chenter</i> furlongs.

  <h2>Chapter 15</h2>

  </li>
  <li>And I <i>vardad</i> as it were a sea of glass mingled with <i>binco fakement</i>: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over <i>her</i> image, and over <i>her</i> <i>Marcia</i>, and over the number of <i>her</i> name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of <i>Gloria</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And they sing the <i>chant</i> of <i>Maureen</i> the <i>serving homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and the <i>chant</i> of the Lamb, <i>cackling</i>, <i>dowry</i> and marvellous are thy works, <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> <i>Dowry butch</i>; just and true are thy ways, thou <i>dowriest homie</i> of saints.
  </li>
  <li>Who shall not fear thee, O <i>Duchess</i>, and glorify thy name? for thou only art <i>fabulosa</i>: for all nations shall <i>troll</i> and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest.

  <li>And after that I looked, and, <i>varda</i>, the <i>holy carsey</i> of the <i>bijou tabernaclette</i> of the testimony in heaven was opened:

  <li>And the <i>setter</i> <i>fairies</i> <i>trolled</i> out of the <i>holy carsey</i>, having the <i>setter</i> plagues, clothed in pure and white <i>lycra</i>, and having their <i>foofs</i> girded with golden girdles.

  <li>And <i>una</i> of the <i>quarter</i> beasts <i>parkered</i> unto the <i>setter</i> <i>fairies</i> <i>setter</i> golden vials full of the wrath of <i>Gloria</i>, who <i>letteth</i> for ever and ever.

  <h2>Chapter 16</h2>

  </li>
  <li>And the first <i>trolled</i>, and poured out <i>her</i> vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and <i>naff</i> sore upon the <i>homies</i> which had the <i>Marcia</i> of the beast, and upon them which worshipped <i>her</i> image.
  </li>
  <li>And the second <i>fairy</i> poured out <i>her</i> vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a <i>stiff</i> <i>homie</i>: and every living <i>nishta lucoddy</i> <i>carked it</i> in the sea.
  </li>
  <li>And the third <i>fairy</i> poured out <i>her</i> vial upon the rivers and fountains of <i>aquas</i>; and they became blood.
  </li>
  <li>And I <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>aquas</i> <i>cackle</i>, Thou art <i>bona</i>, O <i>Duchess</i>, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.
  </li>
  <li>For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast <i>parkered</i> them blood to <i>buvare</i>; for they are <i>bona</i>.

  <li>And I <i>aunt nelled</i> another out of the <i>grovelling fakement</i> <i>cackle</i>, Even so, <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> <i>Dowry butch</i>, true and <i>bona</i> are thy judgments.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>quarter</i> <i>fairy</i> poured out <i>her</i> vial upon the sun; and power was <i>parkered</i> unto <i>her</i> to scorch <i>homies</i> with <i>binco fakement</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>homies</i> were scorched with <i>dowry</i> heat, and blasphemed the name of <i>Gloria</i>, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> <i>fabeness</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And the fifth <i>fairy</i> poured out <i>her</i> vial upon the seat of the beast; and <i>her</i> kingdom was full of <i>munge</i>; and they gnawed their <i>polaris</i> for pain,
  </li>
  <li>And blasphemed the <i>Gloria</i> of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>seyth</i> <i>fairy</i> poured out <i>her</i> vial upon the <i>dowry</i> river Euphrates; and the <i>aqua</i> thereof was dried up, that the way of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of the east might be prepared.
  </li>
  <li>And I <i>vardad</i> <i>trey</i> <i>nanti sparkle</i> <i>fairies</i> like frogs <i>troll</i> out of the <i>screech</i> of the <i>drag queen</i>, and out of the <i>screech</i> of the beast, and out of the <i>screech</i> of the false prophet.

  <li>For they are the <i>fairies</i> of devils, working miracles, which <i>troll forth</i> unto the <i>dowriest homies</i> of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that <i>dowry</i> <i>journo</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>Dowry butch</i>.

  <li>And the <i>setterth</i> <i>fairy</i> poured out <i>her</i> vial into the air; and there <i>trolled</i> a <i>dowry</i> <i>cackling fakement</i> out of the <i>holy carsey</i> of heaven, from the throne, <i>cackling</i>, It is done.
  </li>
  <li>And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a <i>dowry</i> earthquake, such as was not since <i>homies</i> were upon the earth, so <i>dowry butch</i> an earthquake, and so <i>dowry</i>.

  <li>And the <i>dowry</i> <i>smoke</i> was <i>medzered</i> into <i>trey</i> parts, and the <i>smokes</i> of the nations fell: and <i>dowry</i> Babylon <i>trolled</i> in remembrance before <i>Gloria</i>, to <i>parker</i> unto her the cup of the <i>sherry</i> of the fierceness of <i>her</i> wrath.

  <li>And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.

  <li>And there fell upon <i>homies</i> a <i>dowry</i> hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and <i>homies</i> blasphemed <i>Gloria</i> because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding <i>dowry</i>.

  <h2>Chapter 17</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>And there <i>trolled</i> <i>una</i> of the <i>setter</i> <i>fairies</i> which had the <i>setter</i> vials, and talked with me, <i>cackling</i> unto me, <i>troll</i> hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the <i>dowry</i> <i>bitaine</i> that sitteth upon many <i>aquas</i>:
  </li>
  <li>With whom the <i>dowriest homies</i> of the earth have committed <i>charvering</i>, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made <i>bevvied</i> with the <i>sherry</i> of her <i>charvering</i>.
  </li>
  <li>So <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> me away in the <i>Fairy</i> into the <i>nishta smoke</i>: and I <i>vardad</i> a <i>palone</i> <i>lett</i> upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of <i>billingsgate</i>, having <i>setter</i> <i>ekes</i> and <i>dacha</i> <i>colins</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>palone</i> was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with <i>gelt</i> and precious stones and <i>zhoosh</i>, having a golden cup in her <i>famble</i> full of <i>dowry cods</i> and filthiness of her <i>charvering</i>:
  </li>
  <li>And upon her forehead was a name <i>screeved</i>, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE <i>dowry</i>, THE MOTHER OF <i>charvering donnas</i> AND <i>dowry cods</i> OF THE EARTH.

  <li>And I <i>vardad</i> the <i>palone</i> <i>daffy</i> with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of <i>Josie</i>: and when I <i>vardad</i> her, I wondered with <i>dowry</i> admiration.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>fairy</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will <i>cackle</i> thee the mystery of the <i>palone</i>, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the <i>setter</i> <i>ekes</i> and <i>dacha</i> <i>colins</i>.
  </li>
  <li>The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall <i>troll up</i> out of the bottomless pit, and <i>troll</i> into perdition: and they that <i>lett</i> on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of life from the foundation of the world, when they <i>varda</i> the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.
  </li>
  <li>And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The <i>setter</i> <i>ekes</i> are <i>setter</i> mountains, on which the <i>palone</i> sitteth.

  <li>And there are <i>setter</i> <i>dowriest homies</i>: <i>chinker</i> are fallen, and <i>una</i> is, and the other is not yet <i>troll</i>; and when <i>she</i> <i>trolleth</i>, <i>she</i> must continue a short space.
  </li>
  <li>And the beast that was, and is not, even <i>she</i> is the <i>otterth</i>, and is of the <i>setter</i>, and goeth into perdition.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>dacha</i> <i>colins</i> which thou sawest are <i>dacha</i> <i>dowriest homies</i>, which have <i>lalled</i> no kingdom as yet; but <i>lall</i> power as <i>dowriest homies</i> <i>una</i> hour with the beast.
  </li>
  <li>These have <i>una</i> mind, and shall <i>parker</i> their power and <i>butchness</i> unto the beast.
  </li>
  <li>These shall make <i>barney</i> with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for <i>she</i> is <i>Duchess</i> of <i>ladies</i>, and <i>dowriest homie</i> of <i>dowriest homies</i>: and they that are with <i>her</i> are <i>screeched</i>, and chosen, and <i>fabulous</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i> unto me, The <i>aquas</i> which thou sawest, where the <i>bitaine</i> sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and <i>polaris</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>dacha</i> <i>colins</i> which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the <i>bitaine</i>, and shall make her desolate and <i>nanti zhoosh</i>, and shall <i>jarry</i> her flesh, and burn her with <i>binco fakement</i>.

  <li>For <i>Gloria</i> hath put in their <i>thumping cheats</i> to fulfil <i>her</i> will, and to agree, and <i>parker</i> their kingdom unto the beast, until the <i>lavs</i> of <i>Gloria</i> shall be fulfilled.

  <li>And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in <i>bona</i> <i>lycra</i>, clean and white: for the <i>bona</i> <i>lycra</i> is the <i>bonaness</i> of saints.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i> unto me, <i>screeve</i>, <i>fabed</i> are they which are <i>screeched</i> unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i> unto me, These are the true sayings of <i>Gloria</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And I fell at <i>her</i> <i>plates</i> to worship <i>her</i>. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, <i>varda</i> thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy <i>sisters</i> that have the testimony of <i>Josie</i>: worship <i>Gloria</i>: for the testimony of <i>Josie</i> is the <i>Fairy</i> of prophecy.
  </li>
  <li>And I <i>vardad</i> heaven opened, and <i>varda</i> a white horse; and <i>she</i> that sat upon <i>her</i> was <i>screeched</i> <i>fabulous</i> and True, and in <i>bonaness</i> <i>she</i> doth <i>beak</i> and make <i>barney</i>.
  </li>
  <li><i>Her</i> <i>ogles</i> were as a flame of <i>binco fakement</i>, and on <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> were many crowns; and <i>she</i> had a name <i>screeved</i>, that no <i>homie</i> knew, but <i>she</i> himself.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>she</i> was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and <i>her</i> name is <i>screeched</i> The <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And the armies which were in heaven <i>trolled after</i> <i>her</i> upon white horses, clothed in <i>bona</i> <i>lycra</i>, white and clean.
  </li>
  <li>And out of <i>her</i> <i>screech</i> goeth a sharp <i>dowry efink</i>, that with it <i>she</i> should <i>slap</i> the nations: and <i>she</i> shall rule them with a rod of iron: and <i>she</i> <i>minceth</i> the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of <i>Dowry butch</i> <i>Gloria</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>she</i> hath on <i>her</i> vesture and on <i>her</i> thigh a name <i>screeved</i>, <i>dowriest homie</i> OF <i>dowriest homies</i>, AND <i>Duchess</i> OF <i>ladies</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And I <i>vardad</i> an <i>fairy</i> standing in the sun; and <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> with a loud <i>cackling fakement</i>, <i>cackling</i> to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, <i>troll</i> and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the <i>dowry</i> <i>Gloria</i>;
  </li>
  <li>That ye may <i>jarry</i> the flesh of <i>dowriest homies</i>, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i>, and the flesh of horses, and of them that <i>lett</i> on them, and the flesh of all <i>homies</i>, both free and bond, both <i>pogey</i> and <i>dowry</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And I <i>vardad</i> the beast, and the <i>dowriest homies</i> of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make <i>barney</i> against <i>her</i> that sat on the horse, and against <i>her</i> army.
  </li>
  <li>And the beast was <i>lelled</i>, and with <i>her</i> the false prophet that wrought miracles before <i>her</i>, with which <i>she</i> <i>mogued</i> them that had <i>lalled</i> the <i>Marcia</i> of the beast, and them that worshipped <i>her</i> image. These both were cast alive into a lake of <i>binco fakement</i> burning with brimstone.
  </li>
  <li>And the remnant were <i>ferricadoozed</i> with the <i>dowry efink</i> of <i>her</i> that sat upon the horse, which <i>dowry efink</i> proceeded out of <i>her</i> <i>screech</i>: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.
  </li>

  <h2>Chapter 20</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>And I <i>vardad</i> an <i>fairy</i> <i>troll</i> down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a <i>dowry</i> chain in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> hold on the <i>drag queen</i>, that <i>badge</i> serpent, which is the Devil, and <i>Sadie</i>, and bound <i>her</i> a <i>mille</i> years,
  </li>
  <li>And cast <i>her</i> into the bottomless pit, and shut <i>her</i> up, and set a seal upon <i>her</i>, that <i>she</i> should <i>mogue</i> the nations <i>nishta</i>, till the <i>mille</i> years should be fulfilled: and after that <i>she</i> must be loosed a <i>bijou</i> season.
  </li>
  <li>And I <i>vardad</i> thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was <i>parkered</i> unto them: and I <i>vardad</i> the <i>nishta lucoddies</i> of them that were beheaded for the <i>varda-ing fakement</i> of <i>Josie</i>, and for the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and which had not worshipped the beast, <i>nishta</i> <i>her</i> image, <i>nishta</i> had <i>lalled</i> <i>her</i> <i>Marcia</i> upon their foreheads, or in their <i>fambles</i>; and they lived and reigned with <i>Crystal</i> a <i>mille</i> years.
  </li>
  <li>But the <i>lettie</i> of the <i>stiff</i> lived not again until the <i>mille</i> years were finished. This is the first resurrection.
  </li>
  <li><i>Fabed</i> and <i>fabulosa</i> is <i>she</i> that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second <i>carking it</i> hath no power, but they shall be <i>godly homies</i> of <i>Gloria</i> and of <i>Crystal</i>, and shall reign with <i>her</i> a <i>mille</i> years.
  </li>
  <li>And when the <i>mille</i> years are expired, <i>Sadie</i> shall be loosed out of <i>her</i> <i>charpering carsey</i>,
  </li>
  <li>And shall <i>troll out</i> to <i>mogue</i> the nations which are in the <i>quarter</i> quarters of the earth, Gog, and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.
  </li>
  <li>And they <i>trolled</i> up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved <i>smoke</i>: and <i>binco fakement</i> <i>trolled</i> down from <i>Gloria</i> out of heaven, and devoured them.
  </li>
  <li>And the devil that <i>mogued</i> them was cast into the lake of <i>binco fakement</i> and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented <i>journo</i> and <i>nochy</i> for ever and ever.
  </li>
  <li>And I <i>vardad</i> a <i>dowry</i> white throne, and <i>her</i> that sat on it, from whose <i>eke</i> the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.
  </li>
  <li>And I <i>vardad</i> the <i>stiff</i>, <i>pogey</i> and <i>dowry</i>, stand before <i>Gloria</i>; and the <i>glossies</i> were opened: and another <i>glossy</i> was opened, which is the <i>glossy</i> of life: and the <i>stiff</i> were judged out of those <i>fakements</i> which were <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossies</i>, according to their works.
  </li>
  <li>And the sea <i>parkered</i> up the <i>stiff</i> which were in it; and <i>carking it</i> and hell <i>laued</i> up the <i>stiff</i> which were in them: and they were judged every <i>homie</i> according to their works.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>carking it</i> and hell were cast into the lake of <i>binco fakement</i>. This is the second <i>carking it</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And whosoever was not found <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of life was cast into the lake of <i>binco fakement</i>.
  </li>

  <h2>Chapter 21</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>And I <i>vardad</i> a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was <i>nishta</i> sea.
  </li>
  <li>And I <i>Jane</i> <i>vardad</i> the <i>fabulosa</i> <i>smoke</i>, new Jerusalem, <i>trolling</i> down from <i>Gloria</i> out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her <i>homie affair</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And I <i>aunt nelled</i> a <i>dowry</i> <i>cackling fakement</i> out of heaven <i>cackling</i>, <i>varda</i>, the <i>bijou tabernaclette</i> of <i>Gloria</i> is with <i>homies</i>, and <i>she</i> will <i>lett</i> with them, and they shall be <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, and <i>Gloria</i> himself shall be with them, and be their <i>Gloria</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>Gloria</i> shall wipe away all tears from their <i>ogles</i>; and there shall be <i>nishta</i> <i>carking it</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>sharda</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>screeching</i>, <i>nishta</i> shall there be any more pain: for the former <i>fakements</i> are passed away.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>she</i> that sat upon the throne <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, I make all <i>fakements</i> new. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, <i>screeve</i>: for these <i>lavs</i> are true and <i>fabulous</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will <i>parker</i> unto <i>her</i> that is athirst of the fountain of the <i>aqua</i> of life freely.
  </li>
  <li><i>She</i> that overcometh shall inherit all <i>fakements</i>; and I will be <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i>, and <i>she</i> shall be my <i>homie chavvie</i>.
  </li>
  <li>But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with <i>binco fakement</i> and brimstone: which is the second <i>carking it</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And there <i>trolled</i> unto me <i>una</i> of the <i>setter</i> <i>fairies</i> which had the <i>setter</i> vials full of the <i>setter</i> last plagues, and talked with me, <i>cackling</i>, <i>troll</i> hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb&#8217;s <i>palone affair</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> me away in the <i>Fairy</i> to a <i>dowry</i> and high mountain, and shewed me that <i>dowry</i> <i>smoke</i>, the <i>fabulosa</i> Jerusalem, <i>trolling down</i> out of heaven from <i>Gloria</i>,
  </li>
  <li>Having the <i>fabeness</i> of <i>Gloria</i>: and her <i>sparkle</i> was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;
  </li>
  <li>And had a wall <i>dowry</i> and high, and had <i>kenza</i> gates, and at the gates <i>kenza</i> <i>fairies</i>, and names <i>screeved</i> thereon, which are the names of the <i>kenza</i> tribes of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel:
  </li>
  <li>On the east <i>trey</i> gates; on the north <i>trey</i> gates; on the south <i>trey</i> gates; and on the west <i>trey</i> gates.
  </li>
  <li>And the wall of the <i>smoke</i> had <i>kenza</i> foundations, and in them the names of the <i>kenza</i> apostles of the Lamb.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>she</i> that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the <i>smoke</i>, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>smoke</i> <i>lettieth</i> foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and <i>she</i> measured the <i>smoke</i> with the reed, <i>kenza</i> <i>mille</i> furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>she</i> measured the wall thereof, an <i>chenter</i> and <i>quarter dacha</i> and <i>quarter</i> cubits, according to the measure of a <i>homie</i>, that is, of the <i>fairy</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the <i>smoke</i> was pure <i>gelt</i>, like unto clear glass.
  </li>
  <li>And the foundations of the wall of the <i>smoke</i> were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the <i>quarter</i>, an emerald;
  </li>
  <li>The fifth, sardonyx; the <i>seyth</i>, sardius; the <i>setterth</i>, chrysolyte; the <i>otterth</i>, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the <i>dachath</i>, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>kenza</i> gates were <i>kenza</i> <i>zhoosh</i>: every several gate was of <i>una</i> pearl: and the street of the <i>smoke</i> was pure <i>gelt</i>, as it were transparent glass.
  </li>
  <li>And I <i>vardad</i> no <i>holy carsey</i> therein: for the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> <i>Dowry butch</i> and the Lamb are the <i>holy carsey</i> of it.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>smoke</i> had no need of the sun, <i>nishta</i> of the moon, to shine in it: for the <i>fabeness</i> of <i>Gloria</i> did lighten it, and the Lamb is the <i>sparkle</i> thereof.
  </li>
  <li>And the nations of them which are saved shall <i>mince</i> in the <i>sparkle</i> of it: and the <i>dowriest homies</i> of the earth do <i>parker</i> their <i>fabeness</i> and honour into it.
  </li>
  <li>And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by <i>journo</i>: for there shall be no <i>nochy</i> there.
  </li>
  <li>And they shall <i>parker</i> the <i>fabeness</i> and honour of the nations into it.
  </li>
  <li>And there shall in no wise enter into it any <i>fakement</i> that defileth, <i>nishta</i> whatsoever worketh <i>dowry cod</i>, or maketh a lie: but they which are <i>screeved</i> in the Lamb&#8217;s <i>glossy</i> of life.

  <h2>Chapter 22</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>And <i>she</i> shewed me a pure river of <i>aqua</i> of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of <i>Gloria</i> and of the Lamb.
  </li>
  <li>In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare <i>kenza</i> manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.
  </li>
  <li>And there shall be <i>nishta</i> curse: but the throne of <i>Gloria</i> and of the Lamb shall be in it; and <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i> shall serve <i>her</i>:
  </li>
  <li>And they shall <i>varda</i> <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>; and <i>her</i> name shall be in their foreheads.
  </li>
  <li>And there shall be no <i>nochy</i> there; and they need no candle, <i>nishta</i> <i>sparkle</i> of the sun; for the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> giveth them <i>sparkle</i>: and they shall reign for ever and ever.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, These sayings are <i>fabulous</i> and true: and the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of the <i>fabulosa</i> prophets <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> <i>fairy</i> to shew unto <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i> the <i>fakements</i> which must shortly be done.
  </li>
  <li><i>Varda</i>, I <i>troll</i> quickly: <i>fabed</i> is <i>she</i> that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this <i>glossy</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And I <i>Jane</i> <i>vardad</i> these <i>fakements</i>, and <i>aunt nelled</i> them. And when I had <i>aunt nelled</i> and <i>vardad</i>, I fell down to worship before the <i>plates</i> of the <i>fairy</i> which shewed me these <i>fakements</i>.
  </li>
  <li>Then <i>cackleth</i> <i>she</i> unto me, <i>varda</i> thou do it not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy <i>sisters</i> the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this <i>glossy</i>: worship <i>Gloria</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i> unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this <i>glossy</i>: for the time is at <i>famble</i>.
  </li>
  <li><i>She</i> that is unjust, let <i>her</i> be unjust still: and <i>she</i> which is <i>manky</i>, let <i>her</i> be <i>manky</i> still: and <i>she</i> that is <i>bona</i>, let <i>her</i> be <i>bona</i> still: and <i>she</i> that is <i>fabulosa</i>, let <i>her</i> be <i>fabulosa</i> still.
  </li>
  <li>And, <i>varda</i>, I <i>troll</i> quickly; and my <i>parkering</i> is with me, to <i>parker</i> every <i>homie</i> according as <i>her</i> <i>acting dickey</i> shall be.
  </li>
  <li>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.
  </li>
  <li><i>Fabed</i> are they that do <i>her</i> <i>butch lavs</i>, that they may have <i>sweet</i> to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the <i>smoke</i>.
  </li>
  <li>For <i>nanti</i> are <i>women who are not conventionally attractive</i>, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.
  </li>
  <li>I <i>Josie</i> have <i>laued</i> mine <i>fairy</i> to testify unto you these <i>fakements</i> in the <i>meshigener carseys</i>. I am the root and the offspring of <i>Davina</i>, and the bright and morning <i>twinkling fakement</i>.
  </li>
  <li>And the <i>Fairy</i> and the bride <i>cackle</i>, <i>troll</i>. And let <i>her</i> that <i>aunt nelleth</i> <i>cackle</i>, <i>troll</i>. And let <i>her</i> that is athirst <i>troll</i>. And whosoever will, let <i>her</i> <i>lell</i> the <i>aqua</i> of life freely.
  </li>
  <li>For I testify unto every <i>homie</i> that <i>aunt nelleth</i> the <i>lavs</i> of the prophecy of this <i>glossy</i>, If any <i>homie</i> shall add unto these <i>fakements</i>, <i>Gloria</i> shall add unto <i>her</i> the plagues that are <i>screeved</i> in this <i>glossy</i>:
  </li>
  <li>And if any <i>homie</i> shall <i>lell</i> away from the <i>lavs</i> of the <i>glossy</i> of this prophecy, <i>Gloria</i> shall <i>lell</i> away <i>her</i> part out of the <i>glossy</i> of life, and out of the <i>fabulosa</i> <i>smoke</i>, and from the <i>fakements</i> which are <i>screeved</i> in this <i>glossy</i>.
  </li>
  <li><i>She</i> which testifieth these <i>fakements</i> <i>cackleth</i>, Surely I <i>troll</i> quickly. <i>Larlou</i>. Even so, <i>troll</i>, <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i>.
