    <h1>Titus</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Pauline</i>, a <i>serving homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and an apostle of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, according to the faith of <i>Gloria</i>&#8216;s elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after <i>fabeness</i>;
    </li>
    <li>In hope of eternal life, which <i>Gloria</i>, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;
    </li>
    <li>But hath in due times manifested <i>her</i> <i>lav</i> through <i>cackling</i>, which is committed unto me according to the <i>butch lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i> our Saviour;
    </li>
    <li>To Titus, mine own <i>homie chavvie</i> after the common faith: <i>gracie</i>, mercy, and peace, from <i>Gloria</i> the <i>Auntie</i> and the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> our Saviour.
    </li>
    <li>For this cause <i>dry</i> I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the <i>fakements</i> that are wanting, and ordain <i>fungi</i> in every <i>smoke</i>, as I had appointed thee:
    </li>
    <li>If any be blameless, the <i>homie affair</i> of <i>una</i> <i>palone affair</i>, having <i>fabulous</i> <i>chavvies</i> not accused of riot or unruly.
    </li>
    <li>For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of <i>Gloria</i>; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not <i>parkered</i> to <i>sherry</i>, no striker, not <i>parkered</i> to <i>manky</i> lucre;
    </li>
    <li>But a <i>affair</i> of hospitality, a <i>affair</i> of <i>bona</i> <i>homies</i>, sober, just, <i>fabulosa</i>, temperate;
    </li>
    <li>Holding <i>nishta manjarry</i> the <i>fabulous</i> <i>lav</i> as <i>she</i> hath been taught, that <i>she</i> may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.
    </li>
    <li>For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:
    </li>
    <li>Whose <i>screeches</i> must be stopped, who subvert whole <i>latties</i>, teaching <i>fakements</i> which they ought not, for <i>manky</i> lucre&#8217;s sake.
    </li>
    <li><i>Una</i> of themselves, even a prophet of their own, <i>cackled</i>, The Cretians are alway liars, <i>nana</i> beasts, slow bellies.
    </li>
    <li>This <i>varda-ing fakement</i> is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;
    </li>
    <li>Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and <i>butch lavs</i> of <i>homies</i>, that turn from the truth.
    </li>
    <li>Unto the pure all <i>fakements</i> are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is <i>nishter</i> pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.
    </li>
    <li>They profess that they know <i>Gloria</i>; but in works they deny <i>her</i>, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every <i>bona</i> <i>acting dickey</i> reprobate.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>But <i>cackle</i> thou the <i>fakements</i> which become sound doctrine:
    </li>
    <li>That the aged <i>homies</i> be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.
    </li>
    <li>The aged <i>palones</i> likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not <i>parkered</i> to <i>dowry</i> <i>sherry</i>, teachers of <i>bona</i> <i>fakements</i>;
    </li>
    <li>That they may teach the <i>bean</i> <i>palones</i> to be sober, to love their <i>homie affairs</i>, to love their <i>chavvies</i>,
    </li>
    <li>To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, <i>bona</i>, obedient to their own <i>homie affairs</i>, that the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i> be not blasphemed.
    </li>
    <li><i>Bean coves</i> likewise exhort to be sober minded.
    </li>
    <li>In all <i>fakements</i> shewing thyself a pattern of <i>bona</i> works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,
    </li>
    <li>Sound <i>cackle</i>, that cannot be condemned; that <i>she</i> that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no <i>nana</i> <i>fakement</i> to <i>cackle</i> of you.
    </li>
    <li>Exhort <i>serving homies</i> to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all <i>fakements</i>; not answering again;
    </li>
    <li>Not purloining, but shewing all <i>bona</i> fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of <i>Gloria</i> our Saviour in all <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>gracie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> that <i>parkereth</i> salvation hath appeared to all <i>homies</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live <i>nishter bevvied</i>, righteously, and <i>fabe</i>, in this present world;
    </li>
    <li>Looking for that <i>fabed</i> hope, and the <i>fabe</i> appearing of the <i>dowry</i> <i>Gloria</i> and our Saviour <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Who <i>parkered</i> himself for us, that <i>she</i> might redeem us from all <i>codness</i>, and purify unto himself a peculiar <i>homies and palones</i>, zealous of <i>bona</i> works.
    </li>
    <li>These <i>fakements</i> <i>cackle</i>, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no <i>homie</i> despise thee.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey <i>beaks</i>, to be ready to every <i>bona</i> <i>acting dickey</i>,
    </li>
    <li>To <i>cackle</i> <i>nana</i> of no <i>homie</i>, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all <i>campness</i> unto all <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For we ourselves also were sometimes <i>dizzy</i>, disobedient, <i>mogued</i>, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating <i>una</i> another.
    </li>
    <li>But after that the kindness and love of <i>Gloria</i> our Saviour toward <i>homie</i> appeared,
    </li>
    <li>Not by works of <i>bonaness</i> which we have done, but according to <i>her</i> mercy <i>she</i> saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Which <i>she</i> shed on us <i>dowrily</i> through <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> our Saviour;
    </li>
    <li>That being justified by <i>her</i> <i>gracie</i>, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
    </li>
    <li>This is a <i>fabulous</i> <i>cackling</i>, and these <i>fakements</i> I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in <i>Gloria</i> might be careful to maintain <i>bona</i> works. These <i>fakements</i> are <i>bona</i> and profitable unto <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But avoid <i>dizzy</i> questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.
    </li>
    <li>A <i>homie</i> that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;
    </li>
    <li>Knowing that <i>she</i> that is such is subverted, and <i>kertervereth</i>, being condemned of himself.
    </li>
    <li>When I shall <i>lau</i> Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to <i>troll</i> unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.
    </li>
    <li><i>Parker</i> Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that <i>nishter</i> be wanting unto them.
    </li>
    <li>And let our&#8217;s also learn to maintain <i>bona</i> works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.
    </li>
    <li>All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. <i>Gracie</i> be with you all. <i>Larlou</i>.
