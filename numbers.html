<li><i>Lell</i> the Levites from among the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, and cleanse them.

<li>And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle <i>aqua</i> of purifying upon them, and let them <i>fatcha</i> all their flesh, and let them <i>dhobie</i> their <i>zhoosh</i>, and so make themselves clean.

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>

<li>And when the <i>homies and palones</i> complained, it displeased the <i>Duchess</i>: and the <i>Duchess</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> it; and <i>her</i> <i>wild</i> was kindled; and the <i>binco fakement</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp.
</li>
<li>And the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>screeched</i> unto <i>Maureen</i>; and when <i>Maureen</i> prayed unto the <i>Duchess</i>, the <i>binco fakement</i> was quenched.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> the name of the place Taberah: because the <i>binco fakement</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> burnt among them.
</li>
<li>And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel also <i>parnied</i> again, and <i>cackled</i>, Who shall <i>parker</i> us flesh to <i>jarry</i>?
</li>
<li>We remember the fish, which we did <i>jarry</i> in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick:
</li>
<li>But now our <i>nishta lucoddy</i> is dried away: there is <i>nishter</i> at all, beside this <i>pannan</i>, before our <i>ogles</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>pannan</i> was as coriander <i>maria</i>, and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium.
</li>
<li>And the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>trolled</i> about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or <i>zsa zsa-ed</i> it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh <i>lube</i>.

<li>And when the dew fell upon the camp in the <i>nochy</i>, the <i>pannan</i> fell upon it.
</li>
<li>Then <i>Maureen</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>parnie</i> throughout their families, every <i>homie</i> in the door of <i>her</i> <i>trolling lettie</i>: and the <i>wild</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> was kindled greatly; <i>Maureen</i> also was displeased.
</li>
<li>And <i>Maureen</i> <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy <i>serving homie</i>? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy <i>vardaing</i>, that thou layest the burden of all this <i>homies and palones</i> upon me?
</li>
<li>Have I conceived all this <i>homies and palones</i>? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest <i>cackle</i> unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing <i>Auntie</i> beareth the sucking <i>chavvie</i>, unto the land which thou swarest unto their <i>aunties</i>?
</li>
<li>Whence should I have flesh to <i>parker</i> unto all this <i>homies and palones</i>? for they <i>parnie</i> unto me, <i>cackling</i>, <i>parker</i> us flesh, that we may <i>jarry</i>.
</li>
<li>I am not able to bear all this <i>homies and palones</i> alone, because it is too heavy for me.
</li>
<li>And if thou deal thus with me, <i>ferricadoza</i> me, I pray thee, out of <i>famble</i>, if I have found favour in thy <i>vardaing</i>; and let me not <i>varda</i> my wretchedness.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Maureen</i>, Gather unto me <i>setter dacha</i> <i>homies</i> of the <i>fungi</i> of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the <i>fungi</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i>, and <i>hilda handcuffs</i> over them; and <i>parker</i> them unto the <i>bijou tabernaclette</i> of the <i>punters</i>, that they may stand there with thee.
</li>
<li>And I will <i>troll</i> down and talk with thee there: and I will <i>lell</i> of the <i>Fairy</i> which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the <i>homies and palones</i> with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.
</li>
<li>And <i>cackle</i> thou unto the <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>bonafy</i> yourselves against to morrow, and ye shall <i>jarry</i> flesh: for ye have <i>parnied</i> in the <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Who shall <i>parker</i> us flesh to <i>jarry</i>? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore the <i>Duchess</i> will <i>parker</i> you flesh, and ye shall <i>jarry</i>.

<li><i>Nanti</i> <i>jarry</i> <i>una</i> <i>journo</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>dewey</i> days, <i>nishta</i> <i>chinker</i> days, <i>nishta</i> <i>dacha</i> days, <i>nishta</i> <i>dewey dacha</i> days;

<li>But even a whole month, until it <i>troll</i> out at your <i>bugle</i>, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised the <i>Duchess</i> which is among you, and have <i>parnied</i> before <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Why <i>trolled</i> we forth out of Egypt?
</li>
<li>And <i>Maureen</i> <i>cackled</i>, The <i>homies and palones</i>, among whom I am, are <i>sey</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>mille</i> footmen; and thou hast <i>cackled</i>, I will <i>parker</i> them flesh, that they may <i>jarry</i> a whole month.
</li>
<li>Shall the flocks and the herds be <i>ferricadoozed</i> for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Maureen</i>, Is the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s <i>famble</i> waxed short? thou shalt <i>varda</i> now whether my <i>lav</i> shall <i>troll</i> to pass unto thee or not.
</li>
<li>And <i>Maureen</i> <i>trolled</i> out, and <i>cackled</i> the <i>homies and palones</i> the <i>lavs</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and gathered the <i>setter dacha</i> <i>homies</i> of the <i>fungi</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i>, and set them round about the <i>bijou tabernaclette</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> down in a cloud, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, and <i>lelled</i> of the <i>Fairy</i> that was upon <i>her</i>, and <i>parkered</i> it unto the <i>setter dacha</i> <i>fungi</i>: <i>any road up</i>, that, when the <i>Fairy</i> rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease.
</li>
<li>But there remained <i>dewey</i> of the <i>homies</i> in the camp, the name of the <i>una</i> was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the <i>Fairy</i> rested upon them; and they were of them that were <i>screeved</i>, but <i>trolled</i> not out unto the <i>bijou tabernaclette</i>: and they prophesied in the camp.
</li>
<li>And there ran a <i>bean cove</i>, and <i>cackled</i> <i>Maureen</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.
</li>
<li>And Joshua the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nun, the <i>serving homie</i> of <i>Maureen</i>, <i>una</i> of <i>her</i> <i>bean coves</i>, answered and <i>cackled</i>, My <i>Duchess</i> <i>Maureen</i>, forbid them.
</li>
<li>And <i>Maureen</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Enviest thou for my sake? would <i>Gloria</i> that all the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s <i>homies and palones</i> were prophets, and that the <i>Duchess</i> would put <i>her</i> <i>Fairy</i> upon them!
</li>
<li>And <i>Maureen</i> gat <i>her</i> into the camp, <i>she</i> and the <i>fungi</i> of Israel.
</li>
<li>And there <i>trolled</i> forth a wind from the <i>Duchess</i>, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a <i>journo</i>&#8216;s journey on this side, and as it were a <i>journo</i>&#8216;s journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were <i>dewey</i> cubits high upon the <i>eke</i> of the earth.

<li>And the <i>homies and palones</i> stood up all that <i>journo</i>, and all that <i>nochy</i>, and all the next <i>journo</i>, and they gathered the quails: <i>she</i> that gathered <i>nanti dowriest</i> gathered <i>dacha</i> homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.
</li>
<li>And while the flesh was yet between their <i>hampsteads</i>, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the <i>Duchess</i> was kindled against the <i>homies and palones</i>, and the <i>Duchess</i> <i>slapped</i> the <i>homies and palones</i> with a <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry</i> plague.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because there they buried the <i>homies and palones</i> that lusted.

<li>My <i>serving homie</i> <i>Maureen</i> is not so, who is <i>fabulous</i> in all mine <i>lattie</i>.

<li>With <i>her</i> will I <i>cackle</i> <i>screech</i> to <i>screech</i>, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the <i>Duchess</i> shall <i>she</i> <i>varda</i>: wherefore then were ye not afraid to <i>cackle</i> against my <i>serving homie</i> <i>Maureen</i>?

<li>Let her not be as <i>una</i> <i>stiff</i>, of whom the flesh is half consumed when <i>she</i> <i>trolleth</i> out of <i>her</i> mother&#8217;s womb.

<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Maureen</i>, If her <i>Auntie</i> had but spit in her <i>eke</i>, should she not be ashamed <i>setter</i> days? let her be shut out from the camp <i>setter</i> days, and after that let her be <i>lalled</i> in again.

<li>And they <i>cackled</i> unto all the company of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, <i>cackling</i>, The land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding <i>bona</i> land.
</li>
<li>If the <i>Duchess</i> delight in us, then <i>she</i> will <i>parker</i> us into this land, and <i>parker</i> it us; a land which floweth with <i>gin and tonic</i>.
</li>
<li>Only rebel not ye against the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>nishta</i> fear ye the <i>homies and palones</i> of the land; for they are <i>pannan</i> for us: their defence is <i>trolled off</i> from them, and the <i>Duchess</i> is with us: fear them not.
</li>
<li>But all the <i>punters</i> bade stone them with stones. And the <i>fabeness</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> appeared in the <i>bijou tabernaclette</i> of the <i>punters</i> before all the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Maureen</i>, How long will this <i>homies and palones</i> provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shewed among them?
</li>
<li>I will <i>slap</i> them with the <i>bad style</i>, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a <i>dowrier</i> nation and mightier than they.
</li>
<li>And <i>Maureen</i> <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>, Then the Egyptians shall <i>aunt nell</i> it, (for thou broughtest up this <i>homies and palones</i> in thy might from among them;)
</li>
<li>And they will <i>cackle</i> it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have <i>aunt nelled</i> that thou <i>Duchess</i> art among this <i>homies and palones</i>, that thou <i>Duchess</i> art <i>vardad</i> <i>eke</i> to <i>eke</i>, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that thou <i>trollest</i> before them, by <i>journo</i> time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of <i>binco fakement</i> by <i>nochy</i>.
</li>
<li>Now if thou shalt <i>ferricadoza</i> all this <i>homies and palones</i> as <i>una</i> <i>homie</i>, then the nations which have <i>aunt nelled</i> the fame of thee will <i>cackle</i>, <i>cackling</i>,
</li>
<li>Because the <i>Duchess</i> was not able to <i>parker</i> this <i>homies and palones</i> into the land which <i>she</i> sware unto them, therefore <i>she</i> hath <i>ferricadoozed</i> them in the <i>nishta smoke</i>.
</li>
<li>And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my <i>Duchess</i> be <i>dowry</i>, according as thou hast <i>cackled</i>, <i>cackling</i>,
</li>
<li>The <i>Duchess</i> is longsuffering, and of <i>dowry</i> mercy, forgiving <i>codness</i> and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the <i>codness</i> of the <i>aunties</i> upon the <i>chavvies</i> unto the third and <i>quarter</i> generation.
</li>
<li>Pardon, I beseech thee, the <i>codness</i> of this <i>homies and palones</i> according unto the <i>dowriness</i> of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this <i>homies and palones</i>, from Egypt even until now.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i>, I have pardoned according to thy <i>lav</i>:
</li>
<li>But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the <i>fabeness</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
</li>
<li>Because all those <i>homies</i> which have <i>vardad</i> my <i>fabeness</i>, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the <i>nishta smoke</i>, and have tempted me now these <i>dacha</i> times, and have not <i>aunt nelled</i> to my <i>cackling fakement</i>;
</li>
<li>Surely they shall not <i>varda</i> the land which I sware unto their <i>aunties</i>, <i>nishta</i> shall any of them that provoked me <i>varda</i> it:
</li>
<li>But my <i>serving homie</i> Caleb, because <i>she</i> had another <i>Fairy</i> with <i>her</i>, and hath <i>trolled after</i> me fully, <i>her</i> will I <i>parker</i> into the land whereinto <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i>; and <i>her</i> <i>maria</i> shall possess it.
</li>
<li>(Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites <i>letted</i> in the valley. ) Tomorrow turn you, and get you into the <i>nishta smoke</i> by the way of the Red sea.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Maureen</i> and unto Aaron, <i>cackling</i>,
</li>
<li>How long shall I bear with this <i>nana</i> <i>punters</i>, which murmur against me? I have <i>aunt nelled</i> the murmurings of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, which they murmur against me.
</li>
<li><i>Cackle</i> unto them, As truly as I live, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, as ye have <i>cackled</i> in mine <i>aunt nelly cheats</i>, so will I do to you:
</li>
<li>Your carcases shall fall in this <i>nishta smoke</i>; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from <i>dewey dacha</i> years <i>badge</i> and upward which have murmured against me.
</li>
<li>Doubtless <i>nanti</i> <i>troll</i> into the land, concerning which I sware to make you <i>lett</i> therein, save Caleb the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jephunneh, and Joshua the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nun.
</li>
<li>But your <i>bijou</i> ones, which ye <i>cackled</i> should be a prey, them will I <i>parker</i> in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.
</li>
<li>But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this <i>nishta smoke</i>.
</li>
<li>And your <i>chavvies</i> shall <i>troll</i> in the <i>nishta smoke</i> <i>quarter dacha</i> years, and bear your <i>bitainedoms</i>, until your carcases be wasted in the <i>nishta smoke</i>.
</li>
<li>After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even <i>quarter dacha</i> days, each <i>journo</i> for a year, shall ye bear your <i>cods</i>, even <i>quarter dacha</i> years, and ye shall know my breach of promise.
</li>
<li>I the <i>Duchess</i> have <i>cackled</i>, I will surely do it unto all this <i>nana</i> <i>punters</i>, that are gathered together against me: in this <i>nishta smoke</i> they shall be consumed, and there they shall <i>cark it</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>homies</i>, which <i>Maureen</i> <i>laued</i> to search the land, who <i>trolled back</i>, and made all the <i>punters</i> to murmur against <i>her</i>, by bringing up a slander upon the land,
</li>
<li>Even those <i>homies</i> that did <i>parker</i> up the <i>nana</i> report upon the land, <i>carked it</i> by the plague before the <i>Duchess</i>.
</li>
<li>But Joshua the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nun, and Caleb the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jephunneh, which were of the <i>homies</i> that <i>trolled</i> to search the land, lived still.
</li>
<li>And <i>Maureen</i> <i>cackled</i> these sayings unto all the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel: and the <i>homies and palones</i> mourned greatly.
</li>
<li>And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, <i>cackling</i>, Lo, we be here, and will <i>troll</i> up unto the place which the <i>Duchess</i> hath promised: for we have <i>kertervered</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>Maureen</i> <i>cackled</i>, Wherefore now do ye transgress the <i>butch lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>? but it shall not prosper.
</li>
<li><i>Troll not</i> up, for the <i>Duchess</i> is not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies.
</li>
<li>For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye shall fall by the <i>dowry efink</i>: because ye are turned away from the <i>Duchess</i>, therefore the <i>Duchess</i> will not be with you.
</li>
<li>But they presumed to <i>troll</i> up unto the hill top: <i>any road up</i> the <i>bijou arkette</i> of the covenant of the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>Maureen</i>, <i>trolled off</i> not out of the camp.
</li>
<li>Then the Amalekites <i>trolled</i> down, and the Canaanites which <i>letted</i> in that hill, and <i>slapped</i> them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah.

<li>But if the <i>Duchess</i> make a new <i>fakement</i>, and the earth open her <i>screech</i>, and <i>jarry</i> them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they <i>troll</i> down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these <i>homies</i> have provoked the <i>Duchess</i>.

<li>And there <i>trolled</i> out a <i>binco fakement</i> from the <i>Duchess</i>, and consumed the <i>dewey</i> <i>chenter</i> and <i>chinker dacha</i> <i>homies</i> that offered <i>smelly</i>.

<li>The censers of these <i>kerterverers</i> against their own <i>nishta lucoddies</i>, let them make them broad plates for a covering of the <i>grovelling fakement</i>: for they offered them before the <i>Duchess</i>, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign unto the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel.

<li>And why have ye brought up the <i>punters</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> into this <i>nishta smoke</i>, that we and our cattle should <i>cark it</i> there?

<li>And wherefore have ye made us to <i>troll</i> up out of Egypt, to <i>parker</i> us in unto this <i>nana</i> place? it is no place of <i>maria</i>, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; <i>nishta</i> is there any <i>aqua</i> to <i>buvare</i>.

<li>And <i>Maureen</i> lifted up <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>, and with <i>her</i> rod <i>she</i> <i>slapped</i> the rock twice: and the <i>aqua</i> <i>trolled</i> out <i>dowrily</i>, and the <i>punters</i> drank, and their beasts also.

<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Maureen</i> and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to <i>bonafy</i> me in the <i>ogles</i> of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, therefore <i>nanti</i> <i>parker</i> this <i>punters</i> into the land which I have <i>parkered</i> them.
</li>
<li>This is the <i>aqua</i> of Meribah; because the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel strove with the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>she</i> was sanctified in them.
</li>
<li>And <i>Maureen</i> <i>laued</i> messengers from Kadesh unto the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Edom, Thus <i>cackleth</i> thy <i>sister</i> Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us:
</li>
<li>How our <i>aunties</i> <i>trolled</i> down into Egypt, and we have <i>letted</i> in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our <i>aunties</i>:
</li>
<li>And when we <i>screeched</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>she</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> our <i>cackling fakement</i>, and <i>laued</i> an <i>fairy</i>, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and, <i>varda</i>, we are in Kadesh, a <i>smoke</i> in the uttermost of thy border:

<li>Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, <i>nishta</i> will we <i>buvare</i> of the <i>aqua</i> of the wells: we will <i>troll</i> by the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s high way, we will not turn to the <i>sweet martini</i> <i>nishta</i> to the <i>dry</i>, until we have passed thy borders.
</li>
<li>And Edom <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>troll by</i> me, lest I <i>troll</i> out against thee with the <i>dowry efink</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, We will <i>troll</i> by the high way: and if I and my cattle <i>buvare</i> of thy <i>aqua</i>, then I will pay for it: I will only, <i>nanti</i> doing anything else, <i>troll</i> through on my <i>plates</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>troll</i> through. And Edom <i>trolled</i> out against <i>her</i> with <i>dowry</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, and with a <i>butch</i> <i>famble</i>.
</li>
<li>Thus Edom refused to <i>parker</i> Israel passage through <i>her</i> border: wherefore Israel turned away from <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, even the whole <i>punters</i>, journeyed from Kadesh, and <i>trolled</i> unto mount Hor.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Maureen</i> and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, <i>cackling</i>,
</li>
<li>Aaron shall be gathered unto <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>: for <i>she</i> shall not enter into the land which I have <i>parkered</i> unto the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, because ye rebelled against my <i>lav</i> at the <i>aqua</i> of Meribah.
</li>
<li><i>Lell</i> Aaron and Eleazar <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>, and <i>parker</i> them up unto mount Hor:
</li>
<li>And strip Aaron of <i>her</i> <i>frocks</i>, and put them upon Eleazar <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>: and Aaron shall be gathered unto <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, and shall <i>cark it</i> there.
</li>
<li>And <i>Maureen</i> did as the <i>Duchess</i> commanded: and they <i>trolled</i> up into mount Hor in the <i>vardaing</i> of all the <i>punters</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>Maureen</i> stripped Aaron of <i>her</i> <i>frocks</i>, and put them upon Eleazar <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>; and Aaron <i>carked it</i> there in the top of the mount: and <i>Maureen</i> and Eleazar <i>trolled</i> down from the mount.

</li>
<li>And Israel vowed a vow unto the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, If thou wilt indeed deliver this <i>homies and palones</i> into my <i>famble</i>, then I will utterly <i>battyfang</i> their <i>smokes</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> to the <i>cackling fakement</i> of Israel, and <i>laued</i> up the Canaanites; and they utterly <i>battyfanged</i> them and their <i>smokes</i>: and <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> the name of the place Hormah.
</li>
<li>And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the <i>nishta lucoddy</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i> was <i>dowry</i> discouraged because of the way.
</li>
<li>And the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>cackled</i> against <i>Gloria</i>, and against <i>Maureen</i>, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to <i>cark it</i> in the <i>nishta smoke</i>? for there is no <i>pannan</i>, <i>nishta</i> is there any <i>aqua</i>; and our <i>nishta lucoddy</i> loatheth this <i>sparkle</i> <i>pannan</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>laued</i> fiery serpents among the <i>homies and palones</i>, and they bit the <i>homies and palones</i>; and <i>dowry</i> <i>homies and palones</i> of Israel <i>carked it</i>.
</li>
<li>Therefore the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>trolled</i> to <i>Maureen</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, We have <i>kertervered</i>, for we have <i>cackled</i> against the <i>Duchess</i>, and against thee; pray unto the <i>Duchess</i>, that <i>she</i> <i>lell</i> away the serpents from us. And <i>Maureen</i> prayed for the <i>homies and palones</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Maureen</i>, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, that every <i>una</i> that is bitten, when <i>she</i> <i>varda-eth</i> upon it, shall live.
</li>
<li>And <i>Maureen</i> made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, <i>any road up</i>, that if a serpent had bitten any <i>homie</i>, when <i>she</i> beheld the serpent of brass, <i>she</i> lived.
</li>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.
</li>
<li>And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the <i>nishta smoke</i> which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.
</li>
<li>From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.
</li>
<li>From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the <i>nishta smoke</i> that <i>trolleth</i> out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
</li>
<li>Wherefore it is <i>cackled</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the wars of the <i>Duchess</i>, What <i>she</i> did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,
</li>
<li>And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and <i>lettieth</i> upon the border of Moab.
</li>
<li>And from thence they <i>trolled</i> to Beer: that is the well whereof the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Maureen</i>, Gather the <i>homies and palones</i> together, and I will <i>parker</i> them <i>aqua</i>.
</li>
<li>Then Israel sang this <i>chant</i>, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:
</li>
<li>The <i>princesses</i> digged the well, the nobles of the <i>homies and palones</i> digged it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the <i>nishta smoke</i> they <i>trolled</i> to Mattanah:
</li>
<li>And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:
</li>
<li>And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which <i>varda-eth</i> toward Jeshimon.
</li>
<li>And Israel <i>laued</i> messengers unto Sihon <i>dowriest homie</i> of the Amorites, <i>cackling</i>,
</li>
<li>Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not <i>buvare</i> of the <i>aquas</i> of the well: but we will <i>troll</i> along by the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s high way, until we be past thy borders.
</li>
<li>And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through <i>her</i> border: but Sihon gathered all <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i> together, and <i>trolled</i> out against Israel into the <i>nishta smoke</i>: and <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> to Jahaz, and <i>palavered</i> against Israel.
</li>
<li>And Israel <i>slapped</i> <i>her</i> with the edge of the <i>dowry efink</i>, and possessed <i>her</i> land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon: for the border of the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon was <i>butch</i>.
</li>
<li>And Israel <i>lelled</i> all these <i>smokes</i>: and Israel <i>letted</i> in all the <i>smokes</i> of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.
</li>
<li>For Heshbon was the <i>smoke</i> of Sihon the <i>dowriest homie</i> of the Amorites, who had <i>palavered</i> against the former <i>dowriest homie</i> of Moab, and <i>lelled</i> all <i>her</i> land out of <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>, even unto Arnon.
</li>
<li>Wherefore they that <i>cackle</i> in proverbs <i>cackle</i>, <i>troll</i> into Heshbon, let the <i>smoke</i> of Sihon be built and prepared:
</li>
<li>For there is a <i>binco fakement</i> <i>trolled</i> out of Heshbon, a flame from the <i>smoke</i> of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, and the <i>ladies</i> of the high places of Arnon.
</li>
<li>Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O <i>homies and palones</i> of Chemosh: <i>she</i> hath <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> that <i>scarpered</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>palone chavvies</i>, into captivity unto Sihon <i>dowriest homie</i> of the Amorites.
</li>
<li>We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have <i>laued</i> them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba.
</li>
<li>Thus Israel <i>letted</i> in the land of the Amorites.
</li>
<li>And <i>Maureen</i> <i>laued</i> to spy out Jaazer, and they <i>lelled</i> the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.
</li>
<li>And they turned and <i>trolled</i> up by the way of Bashan: and Og the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Bashan <i>trolled</i> out against them, <i>she</i>, and all <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, to the battle at Edrei.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Maureen</i>, Fear <i>her</i> not: for I have <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> into thy <i>famble</i>, and all <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, and <i>her</i> land; and thou shalt do to <i>her</i> as thou didst unto Sihon <i>dowriest homie</i> of the Amorites, which <i>letted</i> at Heshbon.
</li>
<li>So they <i>slapped</i> <i>her</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>, and all <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, until there was none <i>dry</i> <i>her</i> alive: and they possessed <i>her</i> land.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Chapter 22</h2>
<ol>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho.
</li>
<li>And Balak the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Zippor <i>vardad</i> all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
</li>
<li>And Moab was sore afraid of the <i>homies and palones</i>, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel.
</li>
<li>And Moab <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>fungi</i> of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Zippor was <i>dowriest homie</i> of the Moabites at that time.
</li>
<li><i>She</i> <i>laued</i> messengers therefore unto Balaam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Beor to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the <i>chavvies</i> of <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, to <i>screech</i> <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>varda</i>, there is a <i>homies and palones</i> <i>troll</i> out from Egypt: <i>varda</i>, they cover the <i>eke</i> of the earth, and they <i>lett</i> over against me:
</li>
<li><i>Troll</i> now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this <i>homies and palones</i>; for they are too <i>dowry butch</i> for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may <i>slap</i> them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that <i>she</i> whom thou blessest is <i>fabed</i>, and <i>she</i> whom thou cursest is cursed.
</li>
<li>And the <i>fungi</i> of Moab and the <i>fungi</i> of Midian <i>trolled off</i> with the <i>parkerings</i> of divination in their <i>famble</i>; and they <i>trolled</i> unto Balaam, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> the <i>lavs</i> of Balak.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Lodge here this <i>nochy</i>, and I will <i>parker</i> you <i>lav</i> again, as the <i>Duchess</i> shall <i>cackle</i> unto me: and the <i>princesses</i> of Moab <i>letted</i> with Balaam.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>trolled</i> unto Balaam, and <i>cackled</i>, What <i>homies</i> are these with thee?
</li>
<li>And Balaam <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Gloria</i>, Balak the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Zippor, <i>dowriest homie</i> of Moab, hath <i>laued</i> unto me, <i>cackling</i>,
</li>
<li><i>Varda</i>, there is a <i>homies and palones</i> <i>troll</i> out of Egypt, which covereth the <i>eke</i> of the earth: <i>troll</i> now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Balaam, <i>nishta</i> <i>troll</i> with them; <i>nishta</i> curse the <i>homies and palones</i>: for they are <i>fabed</i>.
</li>
<li>And Balaam rose up in the morning, and <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>princesses</i> of Balak, Get you into your land: for the <i>Duchess</i> refuseth to <i>parker</i> me leave to <i>troll</i> with you.
</li>
<li>And the <i>princesses</i> of Moab rose up, and they <i>trolled</i> unto Balak, and <i>cackled</i>, Balaam refuseth to <i>troll</i> with us.
</li>
<li>And Balak <i>laued</i> yet again <i>princesses</i>, more, and more honourable than they.
</li>
<li>And they <i>trolled</i> to Balaam, and <i>cackled</i> to <i>her</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> Balak the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Zippor, Let <i>nishter</i>, I pray thee, hinder thee from <i>trolling</i> unto me:
</li>
<li>For I will promote thee unto <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry</i> honour, and I will do whatsoever thou <i>cackleth</i> unto me: <i>troll</i> therefore, I pray thee, curse me this <i>homies and palones</i>.
</li>
<li>And Balaam answered and <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>serving homies</i> of Balak, If Balak would <i>parker</i> me <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i> full of silver and <i>gelt</i>, I cannot <i>troll</i> beyond the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> my <i>Gloria</i>, to do <i>nanti dowry</i> or more.
</li>
<li>Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this <i>nochy</i>, that I may know what the <i>Duchess</i> will <i>cackle</i> unto me more.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>trolled</i> unto Balaam at <i>nochy</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, If the <i>homies</i> <i>troll</i> to <i>screech</i> thee, rise up, and <i>troll</i> with them; but yet the <i>lav</i> which I shall <i>cackle</i> unto thee, that shalt thou do.
</li>
<li>And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled <i>her</i> ass, and <i>trolled</i> with the <i>princesses</i> of Moab.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i>&#8216;s <i>wild</i> was kindled because <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i>: and the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> stood in the way for an adversary against <i>her</i>. Now <i>she</i> was riding upon <i>her</i> ass, and <i>her</i> <i>dewey</i> <i>serving homies</i> were with <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And the ass <i>vardad</i> the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> standing in the way, and <i>her</i> <i>dowry efink</i> drawn in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and <i>trolled</i> into the field: and Balaam <i>slapped</i> the ass, to turn her into the way.
</li>
<li>But the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.
</li>
<li>And when the ass <i>vardad</i> the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam&#8217;s <i>plate</i> against the wall: and <i>she</i> <i>slapped</i> her again.
</li>
<li>And the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the <i>sweet martini</i> or to the <i>dry</i>.
</li>
<li>And when the ass <i>vardad</i> the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam&#8217;s <i>wild</i> was kindled, and <i>she</i> <i>slapped</i> the ass with a <i>trolling fakement</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> opened the <i>screech</i> of the ass, and she <i>cackled</i> unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these <i>trey</i> times?
</li>
<li>And Balaam <i>cackled</i> unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a <i>dowry efink</i> in mine <i>famble</i>, for now would I <i>ferricadoza</i> thee.
</li>
<li>And the ass <i>cackled</i> unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this <i>journo</i>? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Nay.
</li>
<li>Then the <i>Duchess</i> opened the <i>ogles</i> of Balaam, and <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> standing in the way, and <i>her</i> <i>dowry efink</i> drawn in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>: and <i>she</i> bowed down <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>, and fell flat on <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these <i>trey</i> times? <i>varda</i>, I <i>trolled</i> out to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me:
</li>
<li>And the ass <i>vardad</i> me, and turned from me these <i>trey</i> times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had <i>ferricadoozed</i> thee, and saved her alive.
</li>
<li>And Balaam <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, I have <i>kertervered</i>; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.
</li>
<li>And the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Balaam, <i>troll</i> with the <i>homies</i>: but only the <i>lav</i> that I shall <i>cackle</i> unto thee, that thou shalt <i>cackle</i>. So Balaam <i>trolled</i> with the <i>princesses</i> of Balak.
</li>
<li>And when Balak <i>aunt nelled</i> that Balaam was <i>troll</i>, <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> out to meet <i>her</i> unto a <i>smoke</i> of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost coast.
</li>
<li>And Balak <i>cackled</i> unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly <i>lau</i> unto thee to <i>screech</i> thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?
</li>
<li>And Balaam <i>cackled</i> unto Balak, Lo, I am <i>troll</i> unto thee: have I now any power at all to <i>cackle</i> any <i>fakement</i>? the <i>lav</i> that <i>Gloria</i> <i>laueth</i> in my <i>screech</i>, that shall I <i>cackle</i>.
</li>
<li>And Balaam <i>trolled</i> with Balak, and they <i>trolled</i> unto Kirjathhuzoth.
</li>
<li>And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and <i>laued</i> to Balaam, and to the <i>princesses</i> that were with <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i> on the morrow, that Balak <i>lelled</i> Balaam, and brought <i>her</i> up into the high places of Baal, that thence <i>she</i> might <i>varda</i> the utmost part of the <i>homies and palones</i>.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Chapter 23</h2>
<ol>
<li>And Balaam <i>cackled</i> unto Balak, Build me here <i>setter</i> altars, and prepare me here <i>setter</i> oxen and <i>setter</i> rams.
</li>
<li>And Balak did as Balaam had <i>cackled</i>; and Balak and Balaam offered on every <i>grovelling fakement</i> a bullock and a ram.
</li>
<li>And Balaam <i>cackled</i> unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt <i>parkering</i>, and I will <i>troll</i>: peradventure the <i>Duchess</i> will <i>troll</i> to meet me: and whatsoever <i>she</i> sheweth me I will <i>cackle</i> thee. And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> to an high place.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> met Balaam: and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, I have prepared <i>setter</i> altars, and I have offered upon every <i>grovelling fakement</i> a bullock and a ram.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> put a <i>lav</i> in Balaam&#8217;s <i>screech</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt <i>cackle</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled back</i> unto <i>her</i>, and, lo, <i>she</i> stood by <i>her</i> burnt <i>parker</i>, <i>she</i>, and all the <i>princesses</i> of Moab.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> up <i>her</i> parable, and <i>cackled</i>, Balak the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Moab hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, <i>cackling</i>, <i>troll</i>, curse me Jacob, and <i>troll</i>, defy Israel.
</li>
<li>How shall I curse, whom <i>Gloria</i> hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, whom the <i>Duchess</i> hath not defied?
</li>
<li>For from the top of the rocks I <i>varda</i> <i>her</i>, and from the hills I <i>varda</i> <i>her</i>: lo, the <i>homies and palones</i> shall <i>lett</i> alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.
</li>
<li>Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the <i>quarter</i> part of Israel? Let me <i>cark it</i> the <i>carking it</i> of the <i>bona</i>, and let my last end be like <i>her</i>!
</li>
<li>And Balak <i>cackled</i> unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I <i>lelled</i> thee to curse mine enemies, and, <i>varda</i>, thou hast <i>fabed</i> them altogether.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> answered and <i>cackled</i>, Must I not <i>lell</i> heed to <i>cackle</i> that which the <i>Duchess</i> hath put in my <i>screech</i>?
</li>
<li>And Balak <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>troll</i>, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest <i>varda</i> them: thou shalt <i>varda</i> but the utmost part of them, and shalt not <i>varda</i> them all: and curse me them from thence.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> brought <i>her</i> into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built <i>setter</i> altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on every <i>grovelling fakement</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt <i>parkering</i>, while I meet the <i>Duchess</i> yonder.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> met Balaam, and put a <i>lav</i> in <i>her</i> <i>screech</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>troll</i> again unto Balak, and <i>cackle</i> thus.
</li>
<li>And when <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> to <i>her</i>, <i>varda</i>, <i>she</i> stood by <i>her</i> burnt <i>parkering</i>, and the <i>princesses</i> of Moab with <i>her</i>. And Balak <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, What hath the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i>?
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> up <i>her</i> parable, and <i>cackled</i>, Rise up, Balak, and <i>aunt nell</i>; <i>aunt nell</i> unto me, thou <i>homie chavvie</i> of Zippor:
</li>
<li><i>Gloria</i> is not a <i>homie</i>, that <i>she</i> should lie; <i>nishta</i> the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>, that <i>she</i> should repent: hath <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, and shall <i>she</i> not do it? or hath <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, and shall <i>she</i> not make it <i>bona</i>?
</li>
<li><i>Varda</i>, I have <i>lalled</i> <i>butch lav</i> to bless: and <i>she</i> hath <i>fabed</i>; and I cannot reverse it.
</li>
<li><i>She</i> hath not beheld <i>codness</i> in Jacob, <i>nishta</i> hath <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> perverseness in Israel: the <i>Duchess</i> <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i> is with <i>her</i>, and the <i>screech</i> of a <i>dowriest homie</i> is among them.
</li>
<li><i>Gloria</i> brought them out of Egypt; <i>she</i> hath as it were the <i>butchness</i> of an unicorn.
</li>
<li>Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, <i>nishta</i> is there any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be <i>cackled</i> of Jacob and of Israel, What hath <i>Gloria</i> wrought!
</li>
<li><i>Varda</i>, the <i>homies and palones</i> shall rise up as a <i>dowry</i> lion, and lift up himself as a <i>bean</i> lion: <i>she</i> shall not lie down until <i>she</i> <i>jarry</i> of the prey, and <i>buvare</i> the blood of the <i>ferricadoozed</i>.
</li>
<li>And Balak <i>cackled</i> unto Balaam, <i>nishta</i> curse them at all, <i>nishta</i> bless them at all.
</li>
<li>But Balaam answered and <i>cackled</i> unto Balak, <i>cackled</i> not I thee, <i>cackling</i>, All that the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackleth</i>, that I must do?
</li>
<li>And Balak <i>cackled</i> unto Balaam, <i>troll</i>, I pray thee, I will <i>parker</i> thee unto another place; peradventure it will please <i>Gloria</i> that thou mayest curse me them from thence.
</li>
<li>And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that <i>varda-eth</i> toward Jeshimon.
</li>
<li>And Balaam <i>cackled</i> unto Balak, Build me here <i>setter</i> altars, and prepare me here <i>setter</i> bullocks and <i>setter</i> rams.

<h2>Chapter 24</h2>

<li>And when Balaam <i>vardad</i> that it pleased the <i>Duchess</i> to bless Israel, <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> not, as at other times, to <i>charper</i> for enchantments, but <i>she</i> set <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> toward the <i>nishta smoke</i>.
</li>
<li>And Balaam lifted up <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i>, and <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> Israel <i>letting</i> in <i>her</i> <i>trolling letties</i> according to their tribes; and the <i>Fairy</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>trolled</i> upon <i>her</i>.

<li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> up <i>her</i> parable, and <i>cackled</i>, Balaam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Beor hath <i>cackled</i>, and the <i>homie</i> whose <i>ogles</i> are open hath <i>cackled</i>:

<li><i>She</i> hath <i>cackled</i>, which <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>lavs</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, which <i>vardad</i> the vision of the <i>Dowry butch</i>, falling into a trance, but having <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i> open:

<li>How goodly are thy <i>trolling letties</i>, O Jacob, and thy <i>bijoux tabernaclettes</i>, O Israel!

<li>As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river&#8217;s side, as the trees of lign aloes which the <i>Duchess</i> hath planted, and as cedar trees beside the <i>aquas</i>.

<li><i>Gloria</i> brought <i>her</i> forth out of Egypt; <i>she</i> hath as it were the <i>butchness</i> of an unicorn: <i>she</i> shall <i>jarry</i> up the nations <i>her</i> enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with <i>her</i> arrows.
</li>
<li><i>She</i> couched, <i>she</i> <i>lett</i> down as a lion, and as a <i>dowry</i> lion: who shall stir <i>her</i> up? <i>fabed</i> is <i>she</i> that blesseth thee, and cursed is <i>she</i> that curseth thee.
</li>
<li>And Balak&#8217;s <i>wild</i> was kindled against Balaam, and <i>she</i> <i>slapped</i> <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i> together: and Balak <i>cackled</i> unto Balaam, I <i>screeched</i> thee to curse mine enemies, and, <i>varda</i>, thou hast altogether <i>fabed</i> them these <i>trey</i> times.
</li>
<li>Therefore now <i>scarper</i> thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto <i>dowry</i> honour; but, lo, the <i>Duchess</i> hath kept thee back from honour.

<li>If Balak would <i>parker</i> me <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i> full of silver and <i>gelt</i>, I cannot <i>troll</i> beyond the <i>butch lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, to do either <i>bona</i> or <i>cod</i> of mine own mind; but what the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackleth</i>, that will I <i>cackle</i>?
</li>
<li>And now, <i>varda</i>, I <i>troll</i> unto my <i>homies and palones</i>: <i>troll</i> therefore, and I will advertise thee what this <i>homies and palones</i> shall do to thy <i>homies and palones</i> in the latter days.

<li><i>She</i> hath <i>cackled</i>, which <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>lavs</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and knew the knowledge of the most High, which <i>vardad</i> the vision of the <i>Dowry butch</i>, falling into a trance, but having <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i> open:
</li>
<li>I shall <i>varda</i> <i>her</i>, but not now: I shall <i>varda</i> <i>her</i>, but not <i>ajax</i>: there shall <i>troll</i> a <i>twinkling fakement</i> out of Jacob, and a <i>choad</i> shall rise out of Israel, and shall <i>slap</i> the corners of Moab, and <i>battyfang</i> all the <i>chavvies</i> of Sheth.
</li>
<li>And Edom shall be a <i>fakement</i>, Seir also shall be a <i>fakement</i> for <i>her</i> enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.

<li>And <i>she</i> looked on the Kenites, and <i>lelled</i> up <i>her</i> parable, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>butch</i> is thy <i>lattie</i>, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock.

<li><i>Any road up</i> the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry thee away captive.

<li>And <i>latties on water</i> shall <i>troll</i> from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and <i>she</i> also shall perish for ever.

<h2>Chapter 32</h2>
<ol>
<li>Now the <i>chavvies</i> of Reuben and the <i>chavvies</i> of Gad had a <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry</i> multitude of cattle: and when they <i>vardad</i> the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, <i>varda</i>, the place was a place for cattle;
</li>
<li>The <i>chavvies</i> of Gad and the <i>chavvies</i> of Reuben <i>trolled</i> and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Maureen</i>, and to Eleazar the <i>godly homie</i>, and unto the <i>princesses</i> of the <i>punters</i>, <i>cackling</i>,
</li>
<li>Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,
</li>
<li>Even the country which the <i>Duchess</i> <i>slapped</i> before the <i>punters</i> of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy <i>serving homies</i> have cattle:
</li>
<li>Wherefore, <i>cackled</i> they, if we have found <i>gracie</i> in thy <i>vardaing</i>, let this land be <i>parkered</i> unto thy <i>serving homies</i> for a <i>fakement</i>, and <i>parker</i> us not over Jordan.
</li>
<li>And <i>Maureen</i> <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>chavvies</i> of Gad and to the <i>chavvies</i> of Reuben, Shall your <i>sisters</i> <i>troll</i> to <i>barney</i>, and shall ye <i>lett</i> here?
</li>
<li>And wherefore discourage ye the <i>thumping cheat</i> of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel from going over into the land which the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>parkered</i> them?
</li>
<li>Thus did your <i>aunties</i>, when I <i>laued</i> them from Kadeshbarnea to <i>varda</i> the land.
</li>
<li>For when they <i>trolled</i> up unto the valley of Eshcol, and <i>vardad</i> the land, they discouraged the <i>thumping cheat</i> of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, that they should not <i>troll</i> into the land which the <i>Duchess</i> had <i>parkered</i> them.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s <i>wild</i> was kindled the same time, and <i>she</i> sware, <i>cackling</i>,
</li>
<li>Surely none of the <i>homies</i> that <i>trolled</i> up out of Egypt, from <i>dewey dacha</i> years <i>badge</i> and upward, shall <i>varda</i> the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly <i>trolled after</i> me:

<li>Save Caleb the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nun: for they have wholly <i>trolled after</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s <i>wild</i> was kindled against Israel, and <i>she</i> made them <i>troll</i> in the <i>nishta smoke</i> <i>quarter dacha</i> years, until all the generation, that had done <i>nana</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, was consumed.
</li>
<li>And, <i>varda</i>, ye are risen up in your <i>aunties</i>&#8216; stead, an increase of sinful <i>homies</i>, to augment yet the fierce <i>wild</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> toward Israel.
</li>
<li>For if ye turn away from after <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> will yet again leave them in the <i>nishta smoke</i>; and ye shall <i>battyfang</i> all this <i>homies and palones</i>.
</li>
<li>And they <i>trolled</i> near unto <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and <i>smokes</i> for our <i>bijou</i> ones:
</li>
<li>But we ourselves will <i>troll</i> ready armed before the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our <i>bijou</i> ones shall <i>lett</i> in the fenced <i>smokes</i> because of the inhabitants of the land.
</li>
<li>We will not return unto our <i>latties</i>, until the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel have inherited every <i>homie</i> <i>her</i> inheritance.
</li>
<li>For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward.

<li>And <i>Maureen</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, If ye will do this <i>fakement</i>, if ye will <i>troll</i> armed before the <i>Duchess</i> to <i>barney</i>,
