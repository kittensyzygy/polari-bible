    <h1>2 Corinthians</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Pauline</i>, an apostle of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> by the will of <i>Gloria</i>, and Timothy our <i>sister</i>, unto the <i>meshigener carsey</i> of <i>Gloria</i> which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:
    </li>
    <li><i>Gracie</i> be to you and peace from <i>Gloria</i> our <i>Auntie</i>, and from the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Fabed</i> be <i>Gloria</i>, even the <i>Auntie</i> of our <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, the <i>Auntie</i> of mercies, and the <i>Gloria</i> of all comfort;
    </li>
    <li>Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For as the sufferings of <i>Crystal</i> abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.
    </li>
    <li>And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.
    </li>
    <li>For we would not, <i>sisters</i>, have you ignorant of our trouble which <i>trolled</i> to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above <i>butchness</i>, insomuch that we despaired even of life:
    </li>
    <li>But we had the sentence of <i>carking it</i> in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in <i>Gloria</i> which raiseth the <i>stiff</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Who <i>laued</i> us from so <i>dowry</i> a <i>carking it</i>, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that <i>she</i> will yet deliver us;
    </li>
    <li>Ye also helping together by <i>meshigener muttering</i> for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be <i>parkered</i> by many on our behalf.
    </li>
    <li>For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and <i>fabe</i> sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the <i>gracie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, we have had our conversation in the world, and more <i>dowrily</i> to you-ward.
    </li>
    <li>For we <i>screeve</i> none other <i>fakements</i> unto you, than what ye <i>varda the lavs</i> or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;
    </li>
    <li>As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are our&#8217;s in the <i>journo</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And in this confidence I was minded to <i>troll</i> unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit;
    </li>
    <li>And to <i>troll by</i> you into Macedonia, and to <i>troll</i> again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.
    </li>
    <li>When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the <i>fakements</i> that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be <i>any road up</i> <i>any road up</i>, and nay nay?
    </li>
    <li>But as <i>Gloria</i> is true, our <i>lav</i> toward you was not <i>any road up</i> and nay.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, who was <i>cackled</i> among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not <i>any road up</i> and nay, but in <i>her</i> was <i>any road up</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For all the promises of <i>Gloria</i> in <i>her</i> are <i>any road up</i>, and in <i>her</i> <i>Larlou</i>, unto the <i>fabeness</i> of <i>Gloria</i> by us.
    </li>
    <li>Now <i>she</i> which stablisheth us with you in <i>Crystal</i>, and hath anointed us, is <i>Gloria</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Who hath also sealed us, and <i>parkered</i> the earnest of the <i>Fairy</i> in our <i>thumping cheats</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover I <i>screech</i> <i>Gloria</i> for a record upon my <i>nishta lucoddy</i>, that to spare you I <i>trolled</i> not as yet unto Corinth.
    </li>
    <li>Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>But I determined this with myself, that I would not <i>troll</i> again to you in heaviness.
    </li>
    <li>For if I make you sorry, who is <i>she</i> then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>screeved</i> this same unto you, lest, when I <i>trolled</i>, I should have <i>sharda</i> from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.
    </li>
    <li>For out of <i>dowry</i> affliction and anguish of <i>thumping cheat</i> I <i>screeved</i> unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more <i>dowrily</i> unto you.
    </li>
    <li>But if any have caused grief, <i>she</i> hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.
    </li>
    <li>Sufficient to such a <i>homie</i> is this <i>zsa zsa-ing</i>, which was inflicted of many.
    </li>
    <li>So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive <i>her</i>, and comfort <i>her</i>, lest perhaps such a <i>una</i> should be <i>jarried</i> up with overmuch <i>sharda</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For to this end also did I <i>screeve</i>, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>To whom ye forgive any <i>fakement</i>, I forgive also: for if I forgave any <i>fakement</i>, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of <i>Crystal</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Lest <i>Sadie</i> should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of <i>her</i> devices.
    </li>
    <li>Furthermore, when I <i>trolled</i> to Troas to <i>cackle</i> <i>Crystal</i>&#8216;s <i>gossip</i>, and a door was opened unto me of the <i>Duchess</i>,
    </li>
    <li>I had no <i>lettie</i> in my <i>Fairy</i>, because I found not Titus my <i>sister</i>: but taking my leave of them, I <i>trolled</i> from thence into Macedonia.
    </li>
    <li>Now thanks be unto <i>Gloria</i>, which always causeth us to triumph in <i>Crystal</i>, and maketh manifest the savour of <i>her</i> knowledge by us in every place.
    </li>
    <li>For we are unto <i>Gloria</i> a <i>bona</i> savour of <i>Crystal</i>, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:
    </li>
    <li>To the <i>una</i> we are the savour of <i>carking it</i> unto <i>carking it</i>; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these <i>fakements</i>?
    </li>
    <li>For we are not as many, which corrupt the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i>: but as of sincerity, but as of <i>Gloria</i>, in the <i>vardaing</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackle</i> we in <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?
    </li>
    <li>Ye are our epistle <i>screeved</i> in our <i>thumping cheats</i>, known and <i>varda the lavs</i> of all <i>homies</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Forasmuch as ye are manifestly <i>screeched</i> to be the epistle of <i>Crystal</i> ministered by us, <i>screeved</i> not with ink, but with the <i>Fairy</i> of the living <i>Gloria</i>; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the <i>thumping cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And such trust have we through <i>Crystal</i> to <i>Gloria</i>-ward:
    </li>
    <li>Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any <i>fakement</i> as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of <i>Gloria</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the <i>Fairy</i>: for the letter <i>ferricadozaeth</i>, but the <i>Fairy</i> giveth life.
    </li>
    <li>But if the ministration of <i>carking it</i>, <i>screeved</i> and engraven in stones, was <i>fabe</i>, so that the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel could not stedfastly <i>varda</i> the <i>eke</i> of <i>Maureen</i> for the <i>fabeness</i> of <i>her</i> countenance; which <i>fabeness</i> was to be done away:
    </li>
    <li>How shall not the ministration of the <i>Fairy</i> be rather <i>fabe</i>?
    </li>
    <li>For if the ministration of condemnation be <i>fabeness</i>, <i>dowry</i> more doth the ministration of <i>bonaness</i> exceed in <i>fabeness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For even that which was made <i>fabe</i> had no <i>fabeness</i> in this respect, by reason of the <i>fabeness</i> that excelleth.
    </li>
    <li>For if that which is done away was <i>fabe</i>, <i>dowry</i> more that which remaineth is <i>fabe</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Vardaing</i> then that we have such hope, we use <i>dowry</i> plainness of <i>cackle</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And not as <i>Maureen</i>, which put a vail over <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>, that the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel could not stedfastly <i>varda</i> to the end of that which is abolished:
    </li>
    <li>But their minds were blinded: for until this <i>journo</i> remaineth the same vail untaken away in the <i>vardaing the lavs</i> of the <i>badge</i> testament; which vail is done away in <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But even unto this <i>journo</i>, when <i>Maureen</i> is <i>varda the lavs</i>, the vail is upon their <i>thumping cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> when it shall turn to the <i>Duchess</i>, the vail shall be <i>lelled</i> away.
    </li>
    <li>Now the <i>Duchess</i> is that <i>Fairy</i>: and where the <i>Fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> is, there is liberty.
    </li>
    <li>But we all, with open <i>eke</i> beholding as in a glass the <i>fabeness</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, are changed into the same image from <i>fabeness</i> to <i>fabeness</i>, even as by the <i>Fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Therefore <i>vardaing</i> we have this ministry, as we have <i>lalled</i> mercy, we faint not;
    </li>
    <li>But have renounced the hidden <i>fakements</i> of dishonesty, not <i>mincing</i> in craftiness, <i>nishta</i> handling the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i> deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every <i>homie</i>&#8216;s conscience in the <i>vardaing</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But if our <i>gossip</i> be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:
    </li>
    <li>In whom the <i>Gloria</i> of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the <i>sparkle</i> of the <i>fabe</i> <i>gossip</i> of <i>Crystal</i>, who is the image of <i>Gloria</i>, should shine unto them.
    </li>
    <li>For we <i>cackle</i> not ourselves, but <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i> the <i>Duchess</i>; and ourselves your <i>serving homies</i> for <i>Josie</i>&#8216; sake.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>Gloria</i>, who commanded the <i>sparkle</i> to shine out of <i>munge</i>, hath shined in our <i>thumping cheats</i>, to <i>parker</i> the <i>sparkle</i> of the knowledge of the <i>fabeness</i> of <i>Gloria</i> in the <i>eke</i> of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But we have this <i>gelt</i> in earthen <i>fakements</i>, that the excellency of the power may be of <i>Gloria</i>, and not of us.
    </li>
    <li>We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;
    </li>
    <li><i>Chivvied</i>, but not forsaken; cast down, but not <i>battyfanged</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Always bearing about in the <i>lucoddy</i> the dying of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i>, that the life also of <i>Josie</i> might be made manifest in our <i>lucoddy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For we which live are alway <i>laued</i> unto <i>carking it</i> for <i>Josie</i>&#8216; sake, that the life also of <i>Josie</i> might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.
    </li>
    <li>So then <i>carking it</i> worketh in us, but life in you.
    </li>
    <li>We having the same <i>Fairy</i> of faith, according as it is <i>screeved</i>, I believed, and therefore have I <i>cackled</i>; we also believe, and therefore <i>cackle</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Knowing that <i>she</i> which raised up the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> shall raise up us also by <i>Josie</i>, and shall present us with you.
    </li>
    <li>For all <i>fakements</i> are for your sakes, that the abundant <i>gracie</i> might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the <i>fabeness</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For which cause we faint not; but though our outward <i>homie</i> perish, yet the inward <i>homie</i> is renewed <i>journo</i> by <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For our <i>sparkle</i> affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of <i>fabeness</i>;
    </li>
    <li>While we <i>varda</i> not at the <i>fakements</i> which are <i>vardad</i>, but at the <i>fakements</i> which are not <i>vardad</i>: for the <i>fakements</i> which are <i>vardad</i> are temporal; but the <i>fakements</i> which are not <i>vardad</i> are eternal.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>For we know that if our earthly <i>lattie</i> of this <i>bijou tabernaclette</i> were dissolved, we have a building of <i>Gloria</i>, an <i>lattie</i> not made with <i>fambles</i>, eternal in the heavens.
    </li>
    <li>For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our <i>lattie</i> which is from heaven:
    </li>
    <li>If so be that being clothed we shall not be found <i>nanti zhoosh</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For we that are in this <i>bijou tabernaclette</i> do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be <i>jarried</i> up of life.
    </li>
    <li>Now <i>she</i> that hath wrought us for the selfsame <i>fakement</i> is <i>Gloria</i>, who also hath <i>parkered</i> unto us the earnest of the <i>Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the <i>lucoddy</i>, we are absent from the <i>Duchess</i>:
    </li>
    <li>(For we <i>mince</i> by faith, not by <i>vardaing</i>:)
    </li>
    <li>We are confident, I <i>cackle</i>, and willing rather to be absent from the <i>lucoddy</i>, and to be present with the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore we <i>acting dickey</i>, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of <i>Crystal</i>; that every <i>una</i> may <i>lall</i> the <i>fakements</i> done in <i>her</i> <i>lucoddy</i>, according to that <i>she</i> hath done, whether it be <i>bona</i> or <i>cod</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Knowing therefore the terror of the <i>Duchess</i>, we persuade <i>homies</i>; but we are made manifest unto <i>Gloria</i>; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.
    </li>
    <li>For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but <i>parker</i> you occasion to <i>fabeness</i> on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which <i>fabeness</i> in appearance, and not in <i>thumping cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to <i>Gloria</i>: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.
    </li>
    <li>For the love of <i>Crystal</i> constraineth us; because we thus <i>beak</i>, that if <i>una</i> <i>carked it</i> for all, then were all <i>stiff</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And that <i>she</i> <i>carked it</i> for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto <i>her</i> which <i>carked it</i> for them, and rose again.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore henceforth know we no <i>homie</i> after the flesh: <i>any road up</i>, though we have known <i>Crystal</i> after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we <i>her</i> <i>nishta</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore if any <i>homie</i> be in <i>Crystal</i>, <i>she</i> is a new creature: <i>badge</i> <i>fakements</i> are passed away; <i>varda</i>, all <i>fakements</i> are become new.
    </li>
    <li>And all <i>fakements</i> are of <i>Gloria</i>, who hath reconciled us to himself by <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, and hath <i>parkered</i> to us the ministry of reconciliation;
    </li>
    <li>To wit, that <i>Gloria</i> was in <i>Crystal</i>, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their <i>catervers</i> unto them; and hath committed unto us the <i>lav</i> of reconciliation.
    </li>
    <li>Now then we are ambassadors for <i>Crystal</i>, as though <i>Gloria</i> did beseech you by us: we pray you in <i>Crystal</i>&#8216;s stead, be ye reconciled to <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> hath made <i>her</i> to be <i>kertever</i> for us, who knew no <i>kertever</i>; that we might be made the <i>bonaness</i> of <i>Gloria</i> in <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>We then, as workers together with <i>her</i>, beseech you also that ye <i>lall</i> not the <i>gracie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> in vain.
    </li>
    <li>(For <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i>, I have <i>aunt nelled</i> thee in a time accepted, and in the <i>journo</i> of salvation have I succoured thee: <i>varda</i>, now is the accepted time; <i>varda</i>, now is the <i>journo</i> of salvation. )
    </li>
    <li>Giving no offence in any <i>fakement</i>, that the ministry be not blamed:
    </li>
    <li>But in all <i>fakements</i> approving ourselves as the ministers of <i>Gloria</i>, in <i>dowry</i> patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,
    </li>
    <li>In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in <i>acting dickeys</i>, in watchings, in <i>nishta manjarryings</i>;
    </li>
    <li>By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>, by love unfeigned,
    </li>
    <li>By the <i>lav</i> of truth, by the power of <i>Gloria</i>, by the armour of <i>bonaness</i> on the <i>sweet martini</i> and on the <i>dry</i>,
    </li>
    <li>By honour and dishonour, by <i>nana</i> report and <i>bona</i> report: as deceivers, and yet true;
    </li>
    <li>As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, <i>varda</i>, we live; as chastened, and not <i>ferricadozad</i>;
    </li>
    <li>As <i>shardaful</i>, yet alway rejoicing; as <i>nanti dinarly</i>, yet making many rich; as having <i>nishter</i>, and yet possessing all <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>O ye Corinthians, our <i>screech</i> is open unto you, our <i>thumping cheat</i> is enlarged.
    </li>
    <li>Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own <i>chutney locker</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now for a recompence in the same, (I <i>cackle</i> as unto my <i>chavvies</i>,) be ye also enlarged.
    </li>
    <li>Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath <i>bonaness</i> with unrighteousness? and what communion hath <i>sparkle</i> with <i>munge</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And what concord hath <i>Crystal</i> with Belial? or what part hath <i>she</i> that believeth with an infidel?
    </li>
    <li>And what agreement hath the <i>holy carsey</i> of <i>Gloria</i> with idols? for ye are the <i>holy carsey</i> of the living <i>Gloria</i>; as <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>cackled</i>, I will <i>lett</i> in them, and <i>mince</i> in them; and I will be their <i>Gloria</i>, and they shall be my <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore <i>troll</i> out from among them, and be ye separate, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>reef</i> not the <i>nanti sparkle</i> <i>fakement</i>; and I will <i>lall</i> you.
    </li>
    <li>And will be a <i>Auntie</i> unto you, and ye shall be my <i>homie chavvies</i> and <i>palone chavvies</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Dowry butch</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and <i>Fairy</i>, perfecting holiness in the fear of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Lall</i> us; we have wronged no <i>homie</i>, we have corrupted no <i>homie</i>, we have defrauded no <i>homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I <i>cackle</i> not this to condemn you: for I have <i>cackled</i> before, that ye are in our <i>thumping cheats</i> to <i>cark it</i> and live with you.
    </li>
    <li><i>Dowry</i> is my boldness of <i>cackle</i> toward you, <i>dowry</i> is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding <i>bona</i> in all our tribulation.
    </li>
    <li>For, when we were <i>troll</i> into Macedonia, our flesh had no <i>lettie</i>, but we were troubled on every side; <i>nanti</i> were fightings, within were fears.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> <i>Gloria</i>, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the <i>trolling</i> of Titus;
    </li>
    <li>And not by <i>her</i> <i>trolling</i> only, but by the consolation wherewith <i>she</i> was comforted in you, when <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> us your earnest <i>fancy</i>, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.
    </li>
    <li>For though I made you sorry with a letter, I <i>nix</i> repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season.
    </li>
    <li>Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a <i>fabe</i> manner, that ye might <i>lall</i> damage by us in <i>nishter</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>fabe</i> <i>sharda</i> worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the <i>sharda</i> of the world worketh <i>carking it</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>varda</i> this selfsame <i>fakement</i>, that ye sorrowed after a <i>fabe</i> sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, <i>any road up</i>, what clearing of yourselves, <i>any road up</i>, what indignation, <i>any road up</i>, what fear, <i>any road up</i>, what vehement <i>fancy</i>, <i>any road up</i>, what zeal, <i>any road up</i>, what revenge! In all <i>fakements</i> ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore, though I <i>screeved</i> unto you, I did it not for <i>her</i> cause that had done the wrong, <i>nishta</i> for <i>her</i> cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the <i>vardaing</i> of <i>Gloria</i> might appear unto you.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: <i>any road up</i>, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because <i>her</i> <i>Fairy</i> was refreshed by you all.
    </li>
    <li>For if I have boasted any <i>fakement</i> to <i>her</i> of you, I am not ashamed; but as we <i>cackled</i> all <i>fakements</i> to you <i>no flies</i>, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>her</i> inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst <i>she</i> remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye <i>lalled</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Moreover, <i>sisters</i>, we do you to wit of the <i>gracie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> bestowed on the <i>meshigener carseys</i> of Macedonia;
    </li>
    <li>How that in a <i>dowry</i> trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep <i>nishta dinarly</i> abounded unto the riches of their liberality.
    </li>
    <li>For to their power, I bear record, <i>any road up</i>, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves;
    </li>
    <li>Praying us with <i>dowry</i> intreaty that we would <i>lall</i> the gift, and <i>lell</i> upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.
    </li>
    <li>And this they did, not as we hoped, but first <i>parkered</i> their own selves to the <i>Duchess</i>, and unto us by the will of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Insomuch that we <i>fancied</i> Titus, that as <i>she</i> had begun, so <i>she</i> would also finish in you the same <i>gracie</i> also.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore, as ye abound in every <i>fakement</i>, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, <i>varda</i> that ye abound in this <i>gracie</i> also.
    </li>
    <li>I <i>cackle</i> not by <i>butch lav</i>, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.
    </li>
    <li>For ye know the <i>gracie</i> of our <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, that, though <i>she</i> was rich, yet for your sakes <i>she</i> became <i>nanti dinarly</i>, that ye through <i>her</i> <i>nishta dinarly</i> might be rich.
    </li>
    <li>And herein I <i>parker</i> my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.
    </li>
    <li>Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have.
    </li>
    <li>For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a <i>homie</i> hath, and not according to that <i>she</i> hath not.
    </li>
    <li>For I mean not that other <i>homies</i> be eased, and ye burdened:
    </li>
    <li>But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality:
    </li>
    <li>As it is <i>screeved</i>, <i>she</i> that had gathered <i>dowry</i> had <i>nishter</i> over; and <i>she</i> that had gathered <i>bijou</i> had no lack.
    </li>
    <li>But thanks be to <i>Gloria</i>, which put the same earnest care into the <i>thumping cheat</i> of Titus for you.
    </li>
    <li>For indeed <i>she</i> accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of <i>her</i> own accord <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> unto you.
    </li>
    <li>And we have <i>laued</i> with <i>her</i> the <i>sister</i>, whose praise is in the <i>gossip</i> throughout all the <i>meshigener carseys</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And not that only, but who was also chosen of the <i>meshigener carseys</i> to travel with us with this <i>gracie</i>, which is administered by us to the <i>fabeness</i> of the same <i>Duchess</i>, and declaration of your ready mind:
    </li>
    <li>Avoiding this, that no <i>homie</i> should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:
    </li>
    <li>Providing for honest <i>fakements</i>, not only in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, but also in the <i>vardaing</i> of <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And we have <i>laued</i> with them our <i>sister</i>, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many <i>fakements</i>, but now <i>dowry</i> more diligent, upon the <i>dowry</i> confidence which I have in you.
    </li>
    <li>Whether any do enquire of Titus, <i>she</i> is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our <i>sisters</i> be enquired of, they are the messengers of the <i>meshigener carseys</i>, and the <i>fabeness</i> of <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the <i>meshigener carseys</i>, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>For as <i>reefing</i> the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to <i>screeve</i> to you:
    </li>
    <li>For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked <i>dowry</i> many.
    </li>
    <li>Yet have I <i>laued</i> the <i>sisters</i>, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I <i>cackled</i>, ye may be ready:
    </li>
    <li>Lest haply if they of Macedonia <i>troll</i> with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we <i>cackle</i> not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the <i>sisters</i>, that they would <i>troll</i> before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of <i>ogling</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But this I <i>cackle</i>, <i>she</i> which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and <i>she</i> which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.
    </li>
    <li>Every <i>homie</i> according as <i>she</i> purposeth in <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>, so let <i>her</i> <i>parker</i>; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for <i>Gloria</i> loveth a cheerful giver.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>Gloria</i> is able to make all <i>gracie</i> abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all <i>fakements</i>, may abound to every <i>bona</i> <i>acting dickey</i>:
    </li>
    <li>(As it is <i>screeved</i>, <i>she</i> hath dispersed abroad; <i>she</i> hath <i>parkered</i> to the <i>nanti dinarly</i>: <i>her</i> <i>bonaness</i> remaineth for ever.
    </li>
    <li>Now <i>she</i> that ministereth <i>maria</i> to the sower both minister <i>pannan</i> for your <i>manjarry</i>, and multiply your <i>maria</i> sown, and increase the fruits of your <i>bonaness</i>😉
    </li>
    <li>Being enriched in every <i>fakement</i> to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto <i>Gloria</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify <i>Gloria</i> for your professed subjection unto the <i>gossip</i> of <i>Crystal</i>, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all <i>homies</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And by their <i>meshigener muttering</i> for you, which long after you for the exceeding <i>gracie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> in you.
    </li>
    <li>Thanks be unto <i>Gloria</i> for <i>her</i> unspeakable gift.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now I <i>Pauline</i> myself beseech you by the <i>campness</i> and gentleness of <i>Crystal</i>, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:
    </li>
    <li>But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we <i>minced</i> according to the flesh.
    </li>
    <li>For though we <i>mince</i> in the flesh, we <i>nix</i> <i>barney</i> after the flesh:
    </li>
    <li>(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but <i>dowry butch</i> through <i>Gloria</i> to the pulling down of <i>butch</i> holds;)
    </li>
    <li><i>Chucking</i> down imaginations, and every high <i>fakement</i> that exalteth itself against the knowledge of <i>Gloria</i>, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of <i>Crystal</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.
    </li>
    <li>Do ye <i>varda</i> on <i>fakements</i> after the outward appearance? If any <i>homie</i> trust to himself that <i>she</i> is <i>Crystal</i>&#8216;s, let <i>her</i> of himself think this again, that, as <i>she</i> is <i>Crystal</i>&#8216;s, even so are we <i>Crystal</i>&#8216;s.
    </li>
    <li>For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>parkered</i> us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:
    </li>
    <li>That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>her</i> letters, <i>cackle</i> they, are weighty and powerful; but <i>her</i> bodily presence is <i>nelly</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>cackle</i> contemptible.
    </li>
    <li>Let such an <i>una</i> think this, that, such as we are in <i>lav</i> by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present.
    </li>
    <li>For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.
    </li>
    <li>But we will not boast of <i>fakements</i> <i>nanti</i> our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which <i>Gloria</i> hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.
    </li>
    <li>For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are <i>troll</i> as far as to you also in <i>cackling</i> the <i>gossip</i> of <i>Crystal</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Not boasting of <i>fakements</i> <i>nanti</i> our measure, that is, of other <i>homies</i>&#8216;s <i>acting dickeys</i>; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule <i>dowrily</i>,
    </li>
    <li>To <i>cackle</i> the <i>gossip</i> in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another <i>homie</i>&#8216;s line of <i>fakements</i> made ready to our <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> that glorieth, let <i>her</i> <i>fabeness</i> in the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For not <i>she</i> that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the <i>Duchess</i> commendeth.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Would to <i>Gloria</i> ye could bear with me a <i>bijou</i> in my folly: and indeed bear with me.
    </li>
    <li>For I am jealous over you with <i>fabe</i> jealousy: for I have espoused you to <i>una</i> <i>homie affair</i>, that I may present you as a chaste <i>nanti charver</i> to <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled <i>Steve</i> through <i>her</i> subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For if <i>she</i> that <i>trolleth</i> preacheth another <i>Josie</i>, whom we have not <i>cackled</i>, or if ye <i>lall</i> another <i>Fairy</i>, which ye have not <i>lalled</i>, or another <i>gossip</i>, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For I suppose I was not a whit behind the <i>dowry</i> chiefest apostles.
    </li>
    <li>But though I be rude in <i>cackle</i>, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have <i>cackled</i> to you the <i>gossip</i> of <i>Gloria</i> freely?
    </li>
    <li>I robbed other <i>meshigener carseys</i>, taking <i>parkering ninty</i> of them, to do you service.
    </li>
    <li>And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no <i>homie</i>: for that which was lacking to me the <i>sisters</i> which <i>trolled</i> from Macedonia supplied: and in all <i>fakements</i> I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself.
    </li>
    <li>As the truth of <i>Crystal</i> is in me, no <i>homie</i> shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore? because I love you not? <i>Gloria</i> knoweth.
    </li>
    <li>But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which <i>fancy</i> occasion; that wherein they <i>fabeness</i>, they may be found even as we.
    </li>
    <li>For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And no marvel; for <i>Sadie</i> himself is transformed into an <i>fairy</i> of <i>sparkle</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore it is no <i>dowry</i> <i>fakement</i> if <i>her</i> ministers also be transformed as the ministers of <i>bonaness</i>; whose end shall be according to their works.
    </li>
    <li>I <i>cackle</i> again, Let no <i>homie</i> think me a <i>bimbo</i>; if otherwise, yet as a <i>bimbo</i> <i>lall</i> me, that I may boast myself a <i>bijou</i>.
    </li>
    <li>That which I <i>cackle</i>, I <i>cackle</i> it not after the <i>Duchess</i>, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.
    </li>
    <li><i>Vardaing</i> that many <i>fabeness</i> after the flesh, I will <i>fabeness</i> also.
    </li>
    <li>For ye suffer fools gladly, <i>vardaing</i> ye yourselves are wise.
    </li>
    <li>For ye suffer, if a <i>homie</i> <i>parker</i> you into bondage, if a <i>homie</i> devour you, if a <i>homie</i> <i>lell</i> of you, if a <i>homie</i> exalt himself, if a <i>homie</i> <i>slap</i> you on the <i>eke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I <i>cackle</i> as concerning reproach, as though we had been <i>nelly</i>. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I <i>cackle</i> foolishly,) I am bold also.
    </li>
    <li>Are they <i>Kosher Homies and Palones</i>? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the <i>maria</i> of Abraham? so am I.
    </li>
    <li>Are they ministers of <i>Crystal</i>? (I <i>cackle</i> as a <i>bimbo</i>) I am more; in <i>acting dickeys</i> more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.
    </li>
    <li>Of the <i>kosher homies</i> <i>chinker</i> times <i>lalled</i> I <i>quarter dacha</i> stripes save <i>una</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a <i>nochy</i> and a <i>journo</i> I have been in the deep;
    </li>
    <li>In journeyings often, in perils of <i>aquas</i>, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the <i>smoke</i>, in perils in the <i>nishta smoke</i>, in perils in the sea, in perils among false <i>sisters</i>;
    </li>
    <li>In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in <i>nishta manjarryings</i> often, in cold and <i>nanti zhoosh</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Beside those <i>fakements</i> that are <i>nanti</i>, that which <i>trolleth</i> upon me daily, the care of all the <i>meshigener carseys</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Who is <i>nelly</i>, and I am not <i>nelly</i>? who is offended, and I burn not?
    </li>
    <li>If I must needs <i>fabeness</i>, I will <i>fabeness</i> of the <i>fakements</i> which concern mine infirmities.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Gloria</i> and <i>Auntie</i> of our <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, which is <i>fabed</i> for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.
    </li>
    <li>In Damascus the governor under Aretas the <i>dowriest homie</i> kept the <i>smoke</i> of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:
    </li>
    <li>And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and <i>scarpered</i> <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>It is not expedient for me doubtless to <i>fabeness</i>. I will <i>troll</i> to visions and revelations of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I knew a <i>homie</i> in <i>Crystal</i> above fourteen years ago, (whether in the <i>lucoddy</i>, I cannot <i>cackle</i>; or whether out of the <i>lucoddy</i>, I cannot <i>cackle</i>: <i>Gloria</i> knoweth;) such an <i>una</i> caught up to the third heaven.
    </li>
    <li>And I knew such a <i>homie</i>, (whether in the <i>lucoddy</i>, or out of the <i>lucoddy</i>, I cannot <i>cackle</i>: <i>Gloria</i> knoweth;)
    </li>
    <li>How that <i>she</i> was caught up into paradise, and <i>aunt nelled</i> unspeakable <i>lavs</i>, which it is not lawful for a <i>homie</i> to utter.
    </li>
    <li>Of such an <i>una</i> will I <i>fabeness</i>: yet of myself I will not <i>fabeness</i>, but in mine infirmities.
    </li>
    <li>For though I would <i>fancy</i> to <i>fabeness</i>, I shall not be a <i>bimbo</i>; for I will <i>cackle</i> the truth: but now I forbear, lest any <i>homie</i> should think of me above that which <i>she</i> <i>vardaeth</i> me to be, or that <i>she</i> <i>aunt nelleth</i> of me.
    </li>
    <li>And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was <i>parkered</i> to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of <i>Sadie</i> to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.
    </li>
    <li>For this <i>fakement</i> I besought the <i>Duchess</i> thrice, that it might <i>sling yer hook</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, My <i>gracie</i> is sufficient for thee: for my <i>butchness</i> is made <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i> in <i>nelliness</i>. Most gladly therefore will I rather <i>fabeness</i> in my infirmities, that the power of <i>Crystal</i> may <i>lettie</i> upon me.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore I <i>lell</i> pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for <i>Crystal</i>&#8216;s sake: for when I am <i>nelly</i>, then am I <i>butch</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I am become a <i>bimbo</i> in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in <i>nishter</i> am I behind the <i>dowry</i> chiefest apostles, though I be <i>nishter</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and <i>dowry butch</i> deeds.
    </li>
    <li>For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other <i>meshigener carseys</i>, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, the third time I am ready to <i>troll</i> to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I <i>charper</i> not your&#8217;s but you: for the <i>chavvies</i> ought not to <i>lett</i> up for the parents, but the parents for the <i>chavvies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And I will <i>dowry</i> gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more <i>dowrily</i> I love you, the <i>nanti dowry</i> I be loved.
    </li>
    <li>But be it so, I did not burden you: <i>any road up</i>, being crafty, I caught you with guile.
    </li>
    <li>Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I <i>laued</i> unto you?
    </li>
    <li>I <i>fancied</i> Titus, and with <i>her</i> I <i>laued</i> a <i>sister</i>. Did Titus make a gain of you? <i>minced</i> we not in the same <i>Fairy</i>? <i>minced</i> we not in the same steps?
    </li>
    <li>Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we <i>cackle</i> before <i>Gloria</i> in <i>Crystal</i>: but we do all <i>fakements</i>, dearly beloved, for your edifying.
    </li>
    <li>For I fear, lest, when I <i>troll</i>, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:
    </li>
    <li>And lest, when I <i>troll</i> again, my <i>Gloria</i> will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have <i>kertervered</i> already, and have not repented of the <i>nishta sparkle</i> and <i>charvering</i> and lasciviousness which they have committed.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 13</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>This is the third time I am <i>trolling</i> to you. In the <i>screech</i> of <i>dewey</i> or <i>trey</i> witnesses shall every <i>lav</i> be established.
    </li>
    <li>I <i>cackled</i> you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I <i>screeve</i> to them which heretofore have <i>kertervered</i>, and to all other, that, if I <i>troll</i> again, I will not spare:
    </li>
    <li>Since ye <i>charper</i> a proof of <i>Crystal</i> speaking in me, which to you-ward is not <i>nelly</i>, but is <i>dowry butch</i> in you.
    </li>
    <li>For though <i>she</i> was crucified through <i>nelliness</i>, yet <i>she</i> <i>letteth</i> by the power of <i>Gloria</i>. For we also are <i>nelly</i> in <i>her</i>, but we shall live with <i>her</i> by the power of <i>Gloria</i> toward you.
    </li>
    <li>Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> is in you, except ye be reprobates?
    </li>
    <li>But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.
    </li>
    <li>Now I pray to <i>Gloria</i> that ye do no <i>nana</i>; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates.
    </li>
    <li>For we can do <i>nishter</i> against the truth, but for the truth.
    </li>
    <li>For we are glad, when we are <i>nelly</i>, and ye are <i>butch</i>: and this also we wish, even your perfection.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore I <i>screeve</i> these <i>fakements</i> being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>parkered</i> me to edification, and not to destruction.
    </li>
    <li>Finally, <i>sisters</i>, farewell. Be <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i>, be of <i>bona</i> comfort, be of <i>una</i> mind, live in peace; and the <i>Gloria</i> of love and peace shall be with you.
    </li>
    <li>Greet <i>una</i> another with an <i>fabulosa</i> kiss.
    </li>
    <li>All the saints salute you.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>gracie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, and the love of <i>Gloria</i>, and the communion of the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i>, be with you all. <i>Larlou</i>.
