    <h1>Ruth</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now it <i>trolled</i> to pass in the days when the <i>beaks</i> ruled, that there was a <i>nix munjarlee</i> in the land. And a certain <i>homie</i> of Bethlehemjudah <i>trolled</i> to sojourn in the country of Moab, <i>she</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>dewey</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the name of the <i>homie</i> was Elimelech, and the name of <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i> Naomi, and the name of <i>her</i> <i>dewey</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they <i>trolled</i> into the country of Moab, and continued there.
    </li>
    <li>And Elimelech Naomi&#8217;s <i>homie affair</i> <i>carked it</i>; and she was <i>dry</i>, and her <i>dewey</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>lelled</i> them <i>palone affairs</i> of the <i>palones</i> of Moab; the name of the <i>una</i> was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about <i>dacha</i> years.
    </li>
    <li>And Mahlon and Chilion <i>carked it</i> also both of them; and the <i>palone</i> was <i>dry</i> of her <i>dewey</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> and her <i>homie affair</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then she arose with her <i>palone chavvies</i> in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had <i>aunt nelled</i> in the country of Moab how that the <i>Duchess</i> had visited <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i> in giving them <i>pannan</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore she <i>trolled</i> forth out of the place where she was, and her <i>dewey</i> <i>palone chavvies</i> in law with her; and they <i>trolled</i> on the way to return unto the land of Judah.
    </li>
    <li>And Naomi <i>cackled</i> unto her <i>dewey</i> <i>palone chavvies</i> in law, <i>troll</i>, return each to her mother&#8217;s <i>lattie</i>: the <i>Duchess</i> deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the <i>stiff</i>, and with me.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> grant you that ye may find <i>lettie</i>, each of you in the <i>lattie</i> of her <i>homie affair</i>. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their <i>cackling fakement</i>, and <i>parnied</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>cackled</i> unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Naomi <i>cackled</i>, Turn again, my <i>palone chavvies</i>: why will ye <i>troll</i> with me? are there yet any more <i>homie chavvies</i> in my womb, that they may be your <i>homie affairs</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Turn again, my <i>palone chavvies</i>, <i>troll</i> your way; for I am too <i>badge</i> to have an <i>homie affair</i>. If I should <i>cackle</i>, I have hope, if I should have an <i>homie affair</i> also to <i>nochy</i>, and should also bear <i>homie chavvies</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having <i>homie affairs</i>? nay, my <i>palone chavvies</i>; for it grieveth me <i>dowry</i> for your sakes that the <i>famble</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> is <i>trolled</i> out against me.
    </li>
    <li>And they lifted up their <i>cackling fakement</i>, and <i>parnied</i> again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.
    </li>
    <li>And she <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, thy sister in law is <i>trolled</i> back unto her <i>homies and palones</i>, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law.
    </li>
    <li>And Ruth <i>cackled</i>, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou <i>trollest</i>, I will <i>troll</i>; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy <i>homies and palones</i> shall be my <i>homies and palones</i>, and thy <i>Gloria</i> my <i>Gloria</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Where thou <i>carkest it</i>, will I <i>cark it</i>, and there will I be buried: the <i>Duchess</i> do so to me, and more also, if ought but <i>carking it</i> part thee and me.
    </li>
    <li>When she <i>vardad</i> that she was stedfastly minded to <i>troll</i> with her, then she <i>dry</i> speaking unto her.
    </li>
    <li>So they <i>dewey</i> <i>trolled</i> until they <i>trolled</i> to Bethlehem. <i>Any road up</i>, when they were <i>troll</i> to Bethlehem, that all the <i>smoke</i> was <i>trolled</i> about them, and they <i>cackled</i>, Is this Naomi?
    </li>
    <li>And she <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>screech</i> me not Naomi, <i>screech</i> me Mara: for the <i>Dowry butch</i> hath dealt <i>dowry</i> bitterly with me.
    </li>
    <li>I <i>trolled</i> out full and the <i>Duchess</i> hath brought me home again empty: why then <i>screech</i> ye me Naomi, <i>vardaing</i> the <i>Duchess</i> hath testified against me, and the <i>Dowry butch</i> hath afflicted me?
    </li>
    <li>So Naomi <i>trolled back</i>, and Ruth the Moabitess, her <i>palone chavvie</i> in law, with her, which <i>trolled back</i> out of the country of Moab: and they <i>trolled</i> to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And Naomi had a kinsman of her <i>homie affair</i>&#8216;s, a <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homie</i> of <i>metties</i>, of the family of Elimelech; and <i>her</i> name was Boaz.
    </li>
    <li>And Ruth the Moabitess <i>cackled</i> unto Naomi, Let me now <i>troll</i> to the field, and glean <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> of corn after <i>her</i> in whose <i>vardaing</i> I shall find <i>gracie</i>. And she <i>cackled</i> unto her, <i>troll</i>, my <i>palone chavvie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And she <i>trolled</i>, and <i>trolled</i>, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to <i>sparkle</i> on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.
    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, Boaz <i>trolled</i> from Bethlehem, and <i>cackled</i> unto the reapers, The <i>Duchess</i> be with you. And they answered <i>her</i>, The <i>Duchess</i> bless thee.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> Boaz unto <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i> that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>serving homie</i> that was set over the reapers answered and <i>cackled</i>, It is the Moabitish damsel that <i>trolled</i> back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:
    </li>
    <li>And she <i>cackled</i>, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she <i>trolled</i>, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a <i>bijou</i> in the <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my <i>palone chavvie</i>? <i>troll not</i> to glean in another field, <i>nishta</i> <i>troll</i> from hence, but <i>lett</i> here <i>nishta manjarry</i> by my maidens:
    </li>
    <li>Let thine <i>ogles</i> be on the field that they do reap, and <i>troll</i> thou after them: have I not charged the <i>bean coves</i> that they shall not <i>reef</i> thee? and when thou art athirst, <i>troll</i> unto the <i>fakements</i>, and <i>buvare</i> of that which the <i>bean coves</i> have drawn.
    </li>
    <li>Then she fell on her <i>eke</i>, and bowed herself to the ground, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Why have I found <i>gracie</i> in thine <i>ogles</i>, that thou shouldest <i>lell</i> knowledge of me, <i>vardaing</i> I am a stranger?
    </li>
    <li>And Boaz answered and <i>cackled</i> unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the <i>carking it</i> of thine <i>homie affair</i>: and how thou hast <i>dry</i> thy <i>Auntie</i> and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art <i>troll</i> unto a <i>homies and palones</i> which thou knewest not heretofore.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> recompense thy <i>acting dickey</i>, and a full <i>parkering</i> be <i>parkered</i> thee of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, under whose wings thou art <i>troll</i> to trust.
    </li>
    <li>Then she <i>cackled</i>, Let me find favour in thy <i>vardaing</i>, my <i>Duchess</i>; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast <i>cackled</i> friendly unto thine <i>famble palone</i>, though I be not like unto <i>una</i> of thine handmaidens.
    </li>
    <li>And Boaz <i>cackled</i> unto her, At mealtime <i>troll</i> thou hither, and <i>jarry</i> of the <i>pannan</i>, and dip thy morsel in the <i>alcopop</i>. And she sat beside the reapers: and <i>she</i> reached her parched corn, and she did <i>jarry</i>, and was sufficed, and <i>dry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded <i>her</i> <i>bean coves</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:
    </li>
    <li>And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.
    </li>
    <li>So she gleaned in the field until even, and <i>zsa zsa-ed</i> out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.
    </li>
    <li>And she <i>lelled</i> it up, and <i>trolled</i> into the <i>smoke</i>: and her mother in law <i>vardad</i> what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and <i>parkered</i> to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed.
    </li>
    <li>And her mother in law <i>cackled</i> unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to <i>journo</i>? and where wroughtest thou? <i>fabed</i> be <i>she</i> that did <i>lell</i> knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and <i>cackled</i>, The <i>homie</i>&#8216;s name with whom I wrought to <i>journo</i> is Boaz.
    </li>
    <li>And Naomi <i>cackled</i> unto her <i>palone chavvie</i> in law, <i>fabed</i> be <i>she</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, who hath not <i>dry</i> off <i>her</i> kindness to the living and to the <i>stiff</i>. And Naomi <i>cackled</i> unto her, The <i>homie</i> is near of kin unto us, <i>una</i> of our next kinsmen.
    </li>
    <li>And Ruth the Moabitess <i>cackled</i>, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me also, Thou shalt keep <i>nishta manjarry</i> by my <i>bean coves</i>, until they have ended all my harvest.
    </li>
    <li>And Naomi <i>cackled</i> unto Ruth her <i>palone chavvie</i> in law, It is <i>bona</i>, my <i>palone chavvie</i>, that thou <i>troll out</i> with <i>her</i> maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field.
    </li>
    <li>So she kept <i>nishta manjarry</i> by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and <i>letted</i> with her mother in law.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Then Naomi her mother in law <i>cackled</i> unto her, My <i>palone chavvie</i>, shall I not <i>charper</i> <i>lettie</i> for thee, that it may be well with thee?
    </li>
    <li>And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast? <i>varda</i>, <i>she</i> winnoweth barley to <i>nochy</i> in the threshingfloor.
    </li>
    <li><i>Dhobie</i> thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy <i>clobber</i> upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not thyself known unto the <i>homie</i>, until <i>she</i> shall have done eating and <i>bevvying</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And it shall be, when <i>she</i> <i>lettieth</i> down, that thou shalt <i>Marcia</i> the place where <i>she</i> shall lie, and thou shalt <i>troll</i> in, and uncover <i>her</i> <i>plates</i>, and <i>lett</i> thee down; and <i>she</i> will <i>cackle</i> thee what thou shalt do.
    </li>
    <li>And she <i>cackled</i> unto her, All that thou <i>cackleth</i> unto me I will do.
    </li>
    <li>And she <i>trolled</i> down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her.
    </li>
    <li>And when Boaz had <i>jarried</i> and <i>bevvied</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> was merry, <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she <i>trolled</i> softly, and uncovered <i>her</i> <i>plates</i>, and <i>laued</i> her down.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> at midnight, that the <i>homie</i> was afraid, and turned himself: and, <i>varda</i>, a <i>palone</i> <i>lett</i> at <i>her</i> <i>plates</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine <i>famble palone</i>: spread therefore thy <i>frock</i> over thine <i>famble palone</i>; for thou art a near kinsman.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>fabed</i> be thou of the <i>Duchess</i>, my <i>palone chavvie</i>: for thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not <i>bean coves</i>, whether <i>nanti dinarly</i> or rich.
    </li>
    <li>And now, my <i>palone chavvie</i>, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the <i>smoke</i> of my <i>homies and palones</i> doth know that thou art a virtuous <i>palone</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I.
    </li>
    <li>Tarry this <i>nochy</i>, and it shall be in the morning, that if <i>she</i> will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let <i>her</i> do the kinsman&#8217;s part: but if <i>she</i> will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the <i>Duchess</i> <i>letteth</i>: lie down until the morning.
    </li>
    <li>And she <i>lett</i> at <i>her</i> <i>plates</i> until the morning: and she rose up before <i>una</i> could know another. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Let it not be known that a <i>palone</i> <i>trolled</i> into the floor.
    </li>
    <li>Also <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>parker</i> the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, <i>she</i> measured <i>sey</i> measures of barley, and <i>laued</i> it on her: and she <i>trolled</i> into the <i>smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when she <i>trolled</i> to her mother in law, she <i>cackled</i>, Who art thou, my <i>palone chavvie</i>? And she <i>cackled</i> her all that the <i>homie</i> had done to her.
    </li>
    <li>And she <i>cackled</i>, These <i>sey</i> measures of barley <i>parkered</i> <i>she</i> me; for <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> to me, <i>troll not</i> empty unto thy mother in law.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> she, <i>lett</i> still, my <i>palone chavvie</i>, until thou know how the matter will fall: for the <i>homie</i> will not be in <i>lettie</i>, until <i>she</i> have finished the <i>fakement</i> this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Then <i>trolled</i> Boaz up to the gate, and sat <i>her</i> down there: and, <i>varda</i>, the kinsman of whom Boaz <i>cackled</i> <i>trolled</i> by; unto whom <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Ho, such a <i>una</i>! turn aside, <i>lett</i> down here. And <i>she</i> turned aside, and sat down.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> <i>dacha</i> <i>homies</i> of the <i>fungi</i> of the <i>smoke</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>lett</i> ye down here. And they sat down.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is <i>troll</i> again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our <i>sister</i> Elimelech&#8217;s:
    </li>
    <li>And I thought to advertise thee, <i>cackling</i>, Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the <i>fungi</i> of my <i>homies and palones</i>. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then <i>cackle</i> me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after thee. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, I will redeem it.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> Boaz, What <i>journo</i> thou buyest the field of the <i>famble</i> of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the <i>palone affair</i> of the <i>stiff</i>, to raise up the name of the <i>stiff</i> upon <i>her</i> inheritance.
    </li>
    <li>And the kinsman <i>cackled</i>, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my <i>sweet</i> to thyself; for I cannot redeem it.
    </li>
    <li>Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all <i>fakements</i>; a <i>homie</i> plucked off <i>her</i> <i>slingback</i>, and <i>parkered</i> it to <i>her</i> <i>homie ajax</i>: and this was a testimony in Israel.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore the kinsman <i>cackled</i> unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So <i>she</i> drew off <i>her</i> <i>slingback</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Boaz <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>fungi</i>, and unto all the <i>homies and palones</i>, Ye are witnesses this <i>journo</i>, that I have bought all that was Elimelech&#8217;s, and all that was Chilion&#8217;s and Mahlon&#8217;s, of the <i>famble</i> of Naomi.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the <i>palone affair</i> of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my <i>palone affair</i>, to raise up the name of the <i>stiff</i> upon <i>her</i> inheritance, that the name of the <i>stiff</i> be not cut off from among <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, and from the gate of <i>her</i> place: ye are witnesses this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And all the <i>homies and palones</i> that were in the gate, and the <i>fungi</i>, <i>cackled</i>, We are witnesses. The <i>Duchess</i> make the <i>palone</i> that is <i>troll</i> into thine <i>lattie</i> like Rachel and like Leah, which <i>dewey</i> did build the <i>lattie</i> of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:
    </li>
    <li>And let thy <i>lattie</i> be like the <i>lattie</i> of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the <i>maria</i> which the <i>Duchess</i> shall <i>parker</i> thee of this <i>bean</i> <i>palone</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So Boaz <i>lelled</i> Ruth, and she was <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>: and when <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> in unto her, the <i>Duchess</i> <i>parkered</i> her conception, and she bare a <i>homie chavvie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>palones</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Naomi, <i>fabed</i> be the <i>Duchess</i>, which hath not <i>dry</i> thee this <i>journo</i> <i>nanti</i> a kinsman, that <i>her</i> name may be famous in Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thine <i>badgeness</i>: for thy <i>palone chavvie</i> in law, which loveth thee, which is <i>benar</i> to thee than <i>setter</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>, hath born <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Naomi <i>lelled</i> the <i>chavvie</i>, and <i>laued</i> it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>palones</i> her neighbours <i>parkered</i> it a name, <i>cackling</i>, There is a <i>homie chavvie</i> born to Naomi; and they <i>screeched</i> <i>her</i> name Obed: <i>she</i> is the <i>Auntie</i> of Jesse, the <i>Auntie</i> of <i>Davina</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now these are the <i>chavvies</i> of Pharez: Pharez <i>chavvied</i> Hezron,
    </li>
    <li>And Hezron <i>chavvied</i> Ram, and Ram <i>chavvied</i> Amminadab,
    </li>
    <li>And Amminadab <i>chavvied</i> Nahshon, and Nahshon <i>chavvied</i> Salmon,
    </li>
    <li>And Salmon <i>chavvied</i> Boaz, and Boaz <i>chavvied</i> Obed,
    </li>
    <li>And Obed <i>chavvied</i> Jesse, and Jesse <i>chavvied</i> <i>Davina</i>.
    </li>
