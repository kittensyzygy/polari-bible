    <h1>Galatians</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Pauline</i>, an apostle, (not of <i>homies</i>, <i>nishta</i> by <i>homie</i>, but by <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, and <i>Gloria</i> the <i>Auntie</i>, who raised <i>her</i> from the <i>stiff</i>ðŸ˜‰
    </li>
    <li>And all the <i>sisters</i> which are with me, unto the <i>meshigener carseys</i> of Galatia:
    </li>
    <li><i>Gracie</i> be to you and peace from <i>Gloria</i> the <i>Auntie</i>, and from our <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Who <i>parkered</i> himself for our <i>kertervers</i>, that <i>she</i> might deliver us from this present <i>nana</i> world, according to the will of <i>Gloria</i> and our <i>Auntie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>To whom be <i>fabeness</i> for ever and ever. <i>Larlou</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I marvel that ye are so soon removed from <i>her</i> that <i>screeched</i> you into the <i>gracie</i> of <i>Crystal</i> unto another <i>gossip</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the <i>gossip</i> of <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But though we, or an <i>fairy</i> from heaven, <i>cackle</i> any other <i>gossip</i> unto you than that which we have <i>cackled</i> unto you, let <i>her</i> be accursed.
    </li>
    <li>As we <i>cackled</i> before, so <i>cackle</i> I now again, if any <i>homie</i> <i>cackle</i> any other <i>gossip</i> unto you than that ye have <i>lalled</i>, let <i>her</i> be accursed.
    </li>
    <li>For do I now persuade <i>homies</i>, or <i>Gloria</i>? or do I <i>charper</i> to please <i>homies</i>? for if I yet pleased <i>homies</i>, I should not be the <i>serving homie</i> of <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But I certify you, <i>sisters</i>, that the <i>gossip</i> which was <i>cackled</i> of me is not after <i>homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For I <i>nishta</i> <i>lalled</i> it of <i>homie</i>, <i>nishta</i> was I taught it, but by the revelation of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For ye have <i>aunt nelled</i> of my conversation in time past in the <i>kosher homies</i>&#8216; religion, how that beyond measure I <i>chivvied</i> the <i>meshigener carsey</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and wasted it:
    </li>
    <li>And profited in the <i>kosher homies</i>&#8216; religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my <i>aunties</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But when it pleased <i>Gloria</i>, who separated me from my mother&#8217;s womb, and <i>screeched</i> me by <i>her</i> <i>gracie</i>,
    </li>
    <li>To reveal <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> in me, that I might <i>cackle</i> <i>her</i> among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:
    </li>
    <li><i>Nishta</i> <i>trolled</i> I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I <i>trolled</i> into Arabia, and <i>trolled back</i> again unto Damascus.
    </li>
    <li>Then after <i>trey</i> years I <i>trolled</i> up to Jerusalem to <i>varda</i> <i>Petra</i>, and <i>letted</i> with <i>her</i> fifteen days.
    </li>
    <li>But other of the apostles <i>vardad</i> I none, save James the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s <i>sister</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now the <i>fakements</i> which I <i>screeve</i> unto you, <i>varda</i>, before <i>Gloria</i>, I lie not.
    </li>
    <li>Afterwards I <i>trolled</i> into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;
    </li>
    <li>And was unknown by <i>eke</i> unto the <i>meshigener carseys</i> of Judaea which were in <i>Crystal</i>:
    </li>
    <li>But they had <i>aunt nelled</i> only, That <i>she</i> which <i>chivvied</i> us in times past now preacheth the faith which once <i>she</i> <i>battyfanged</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they glorified <i>Gloria</i> in me.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Then fourteen years after I <i>trolled</i> up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and <i>lelled</i> Titus with me also.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>trolled</i> up by revelation, and communicated unto them that <i>gossip</i> which I <i>cackle</i> among the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>nishta</i> Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be <i>roundhead</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And that because of false <i>sisters</i> unawares brought in, who <i>trolled</i> in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i>, that they might <i>parker</i> us into bondage:
    </li>
    <li>To whom we <i>parkered</i> place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the <i>gossip</i> might continue with you.
    </li>
    <li>But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: <i>Gloria</i> accepteth no <i>homie</i>&#8216;s person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added <i>nishter</i> to me:
    </li>
    <li>But contrariwise, when they <i>vardad</i> that the <i>gossip</i> of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the <i>gossip</i> of the circumcision was unto <i>Petra</i>;
    </li>
    <li>(For <i>she</i> that wrought effectually in <i>Petra</i> to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was <i>dowry butch</i> in me toward the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>ðŸ™‚
    </li>
    <li>And when James, Cephas, and <i>Jane</i>, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the <i>gracie</i> that was <i>parkered</i> unto me, they <i>parkered</i> to me and Barnabas the <i>sweet</i> <i>fambles</i> of fellowship; that we should <i>troll</i> unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.
    </li>
    <li>Only they would that we should remember the <i>nanti dinarly</i>; the same which I also was forward to do.
    </li>
    <li>But when <i>Petra</i> was <i>troll</i> to Antioch, I withstood <i>her</i> to the <i>eke</i>, because <i>she</i> was to be blamed.
    </li>
    <li>For before that certain <i>trolled</i> from James, <i>she</i> did <i>jarry</i> with the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>: but when they were <i>troll</i>, <i>she</i> withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.
    </li>
    <li>And the other <i>kosher homies</i> dissembled likewise with <i>her</i>; insomuch that Barnabas also was <i>lelled</i> away with their dissimulation.
    </li>
    <li>But when I <i>vardad</i> that they <i>minced</i> not uprightly according to the truth of the <i>gossip</i>, I <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Petra</i> before them all, If thou, being a <i>kosher homie</i>, livest after the manner of <i>nishta kosher homies</i>, and not as do the <i>kosher homies</i>, why compellest thou the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> to live as do the <i>kosher homies</i>?
    </li>
    <li>We who are <i>kosher homies</i> by nature, and not <i>kerterverers</i> of the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Knowing that a <i>homie</i> is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, even we have believed in <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, that we might be justified by the faith of <i>Crystal</i>, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.
    </li>
    <li>But if, while we <i>charper</i> to be justified by <i>Crystal</i>, we ourselves also are found <i>kerterverers</i>, is therefore <i>Crystal</i> the minister of <i>kertever</i>? <i>Gloria</i> forbid.
    </li>
    <li>For if I build again the <i>fakements</i> which I <i>battyfanged</i>, I make myself a transgressor.
    </li>
    <li>For I through the law am <i>stiff</i> to the law, that I might live unto <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I am crucified with <i>Crystal</i>: neverthless I live; yet not I, but <i>Crystal</i> <i>letteth</i> in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, who loved me, and <i>parkered</i> himself for me.
    </li>
    <li>I <i>nix</i> frustrate the <i>gracie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>: for if <i>bonaness</i> <i>troll</i> by the law, then <i>Crystal</i> is <i>stiff</i> in vain.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>O <i>dizzy</i> Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose <i>ogles</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?
    </li>
    <li>This only would I learn of you, <i>lalled</i> ye the <i>Fairy</i> by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
    </li>
    <li>Are ye so <i>dizzy</i>? having begun in the <i>Fairy</i>, are ye now made <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i> by the flesh?
    </li>
    <li>Have ye suffered so many <i>fakements</i> in vain? if it be yet in vain.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> therefore that ministereth to you the <i>Fairy</i>, and worketh miracles among you, doeth <i>she</i> it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
    </li>
    <li>Even as Abraham believed <i>Gloria</i>, and it was accounted to <i>her</i> for <i>bonaness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the <i>chavvies</i> of Abraham.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>glossy</i>, foreseeing that <i>Gloria</i> would justify the heathen through faith, <i>cackled</i> before the <i>gossip</i> unto Abraham, <i>cackling</i>, In thee shall all nations be <i>fabed</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So then they which be of faith are <i>fabed</i> with <i>fabulous</i> Abraham.
    </li>
    <li>For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is <i>screeved</i>, Cursed is every <i>una</i> that continueth not in all <i>fakements</i> which are <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the law to do them.
    </li>
    <li>But that no <i>homie</i> is justified by the law in the <i>vardaing</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.
    </li>
    <li>And the law is not of faith: but, The <i>homie</i> that doeth them shall live in them.
    </li>
    <li><i>Crystal</i> hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is <i>screeved</i>, Cursed is every <i>una</i> that hangeth on a tree:
    </li>
    <li>That the <i>bona lav</i> of Abraham might <i>troll</i> on the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> through <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>; that we might <i>lall</i> the promise of the <i>Fairy</i> through faith.
    </li>
    <li><i>Sisters</i>, I <i>cackle</i> after the manner of <i>homies</i>; Though it be but a <i>homie</i>&#8216;s covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no <i>homie</i> disannulleth, or addeth thereto.
    </li>
    <li>Now to Abraham and <i>her</i> <i>maria</i> were the promises made. <i>She</i> <i>cackleth</i> not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of <i>una</i>, And to thy <i>maria</i>, which is <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And this I <i>cackle</i>, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of <i>Gloria</i> in <i>Crystal</i>, the law, which was <i>quarter</i> <i>chenter</i> and <i>trey dacha</i> years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.
    </li>
    <li>For if the inheritance be of the law, it is <i>nishta</i> of promise: but <i>Gloria</i> <i>parkered</i> it to Abraham by promise.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the <i>maria</i> should <i>troll</i> to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by <i>fairies</i> in the <i>famble</i> of a mediator.
    </li>
    <li>Now a mediator is not a mediator of <i>una</i>, but <i>Gloria</i> is <i>una</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Is the law then against the promises of <i>Gloria</i>? <i>Gloria</i> forbid: for if there had been a law <i>parkered</i> which could have <i>parkered</i> life, verily <i>bonaness</i> should have been by the law.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>glossy</i> hath concluded all under <i>kertever</i>, that the promise by faith of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> might be <i>parkered</i> to them that believe.
    </li>
    <li>But before faith <i>trolled</i>, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to <i>parker</i> us unto <i>Crystal</i>, that we might be justified by faith.
    </li>
    <li>But after that faith is <i>troll</i>, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.
    </li>
    <li>For ye are all the <i>chavvies</i> of <i>Gloria</i> by faith in <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For as many of you as have been baptized into <i>Crystal</i> have put on <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>There is <i>nishta</i> <i>kosher homie</i> <i>nishta</i> Greek, there is <i>nishta</i> bond <i>nishta</i> free, there is <i>nishta</i> <i>omee</i> <i>nishta</i> <i>palone</i>: for ye are all <i>una</i> in <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And if ye be <i>Crystal</i>&#8216;s, then are ye Abraham&#8217;s <i>maria</i>, and heirs according to the promise.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now I <i>cackle</i>, That the heir, as long as <i>she</i> is a <i>chavvie</i>, differeth <i>nishter</i> from a <i>serving homie</i>, though <i>she</i> be <i>Duchess</i> of all;
    </li>
    <li>But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the <i>Auntie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Even so we, when we were <i>chavvies</i>, were in bondage under the elements of the world:
    </li>
    <li>But when the fulness of the time was <i>troll</i>, <i>Gloria</i> <i>laued</i> forth <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>, made of a <i>palone</i>, made under the law,
    </li>
    <li>To redeem them that were under the law, that we might <i>lall</i> the adoption of <i>homie chavvies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And because ye are <i>homie chavvies</i>, <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>laued</i> forth the <i>Fairy</i> of <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> into your <i>thumping cheats</i>, <i>screeching</i>, Abba, <i>Auntie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore thou art <i>nishta</i> a <i>serving homie</i>, but a <i>homie chavvie</i>; and if a <i>homie chavvie</i>, then an heir of <i>Gloria</i> through <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Howbeit then, when ye knew not <i>Gloria</i>, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.
    </li>
    <li>But now, after that ye have known <i>Gloria</i>, or rather are known of <i>Gloria</i>, how turn ye again to the <i>nelly</i> and beggarly elements, whereunto ye <i>fancy</i> again to be in bondage?
    </li>
    <li>Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.
    </li>
    <li>I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you <i>acting dickey</i> in vain.
    </li>
    <li><i>Sisters</i>, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not injured me at all.
    </li>
    <li>Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I <i>cackled</i> the <i>gossip</i> unto you at the first.
    </li>
    <li>And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, <i>nishta</i> rejected; but <i>lalled</i> me as an <i>fairy</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, even as <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Where is then the blessedness ye <i>cackled</i> of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own <i>ogles</i>, and have <i>parkered</i> them to me.
    </li>
    <li>Am I therefore become your enemy, because I <i>cackle</i> you the truth?
    </li>
    <li>They zealously affect you, but not well; <i>any road up</i>, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.
    </li>
    <li>But it is <i>bona</i> to be zealously affected always in a <i>bona</i> <i>fakement</i>, and not only when I am present with you.
    </li>
    <li>My <i>bijou</i> <i>chavvies</i>, of whom I travail in birth again until <i>Crystal</i> be formed in you,
    </li>
    <li>I <i>fancy</i> to be present with you now, and to change my <i>cackling fakement</i>; for I stand in doubt of you.
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackle</i> me, ye that <i>fancy</i> to be under the law, do ye not <i>aunt nell</i> the law?
    </li>
    <li>For it is <i>screeved</i>, that Abraham had <i>dewey</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>, the <i>una</i> by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> who was of the <i>bond palone</i> was born after the flesh; but <i>she</i> of the freewoman was by promise.
    </li>
    <li>Which <i>fakements</i> are an allegory: for these are the <i>dewey</i> covenants; the <i>una</i> from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.
    </li>
    <li>For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her <i>chavvies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.
    </li>
    <li>For it is <i>screeved</i>, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and <i>screech</i>, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more <i>chavvies</i> than she which hath an <i>homie affair</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now we, <i>sisters</i>, as Isaac was, are the <i>chavvies</i> of promise.
    </li>
    <li>But as then <i>she</i> that was born after the flesh <i>chivvied</i> <i>her</i> that was born after the <i>Fairy</i>, even so it is now.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> what <i>cackleth</i> the <i>glossy</i>? Cast out the <i>bond palone</i> and her <i>homie chavvie</i>: for the <i>homie chavvie</i> of the <i>bond palone</i> shall not be heir with the <i>homie chavvie</i> of the freewoman.
    </li>
    <li>So then, <i>sisters</i>, we are not <i>chavvies</i> of the <i>bond palone</i>, but of the free.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Stand <i>nishta manjarry</i> therefore in the liberty wherewith <i>Crystal</i> hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, I <i>Pauline</i> <i>cackle</i> unto you, that if ye be <i>roundhead</i>, <i>Crystal</i> shall profit you <i>nishter</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For I testify again to every <i>homie</i> that is <i>roundhead</i>, that <i>she</i> is a debtor to do the whole law.
    </li>
    <li><i>Crystal</i> is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from <i>gracie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For we through the <i>Fairy</i> wait for the hope of <i>bonaness</i> by faith.
    </li>
    <li>For in <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> <i>nishta</i> circumcision availeth any <i>fakement</i>, <i>nishta</i> uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.
    </li>
    <li>Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?
    </li>
    <li>This persuasion <i>trolleth</i> not of <i>her</i> that <i>screecheth</i> you.
    </li>
    <li>A <i>bijou</i> leaven leaveneth the whole lump.
    </li>
    <li>I have confidence in you through the <i>Duchess</i>, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but <i>she</i> that troubleth you shall bear <i>her</i> judgment, whosoever <i>she</i> be.
    </li>
    <li>And I, <i>sisters</i>, if I yet <i>cackle</i> circumcision, why do I yet suffer <i>chivvying</i>? then is the offence of the cross ceased.
    </li>
    <li>I would they were even cut off which trouble you.
    </li>
    <li>For, <i>sisters</i>, ye have been <i>screeched</i> unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve <i>una</i> another.
    </li>
    <li>For all the law is fulfilled in <i>una</i> <i>lav</i>, even in this; Thou shalt love thy <i>homie ajax</i> as thyself.
    </li>
    <li>But if ye bite and devour <i>una</i> another, <i>lell</i> heed that ye be not consumed <i>una</i> of another.
    </li>
    <li>This I <i>cackle</i> then, <i>mince</i> in the <i>Fairy</i>, and <i>nanti</i> fulfil the lust of the flesh.
    </li>
    <li>For the flesh lusteth against the <i>Fairy</i>, and the <i>Fairy</i> against the flesh: and these are contrary the <i>una</i> to the other: so that ye cannot do the <i>fakements</i> that ye would.
    </li>
    <li>But if ye be led of the <i>Fairy</i>, ye are not under the law.
    </li>
    <li>Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, <i>charvering</i>, <i>nishta sparkle</i>, lasciviousness,
    </li>
    <li>Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,
    </li>
    <li>Envyings, murders, <i>daffiness</i>, revellings, and such like: of the which I <i>cackle</i> you before, as I have also <i>cackled</i> you in time past, that they which do such <i>fakements</i> shall not inherit the kingdom of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But the fruit of the <i>Fairy</i> is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
    </li>
    <li><i>Campness</i>, temperance: against such there is no law.
    </li>
    <li>And they that are <i>Crystal</i>&#8216;s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.
    </li>
    <li>If we live in the <i>Fairy</i>, let us also <i>mince</i> in the <i>Fairy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Let us not be desirous of vain <i>fabeness</i>, provoking <i>una</i> another, envying <i>una</i> another.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Sisters</i>, if a <i>homie</i> be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an <i>una</i> in the <i>Fairy</i> of <i>campness</i>; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.
    </li>
    <li>Bear ye <i>una</i> another&#8217;s burdens, and so fulfil the law of <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For if a <i>homie</i> think himself to be something, when <i>she</i> is <i>nishter</i>, <i>she</i> deceiveth himself.
    </li>
    <li>But let every <i>homie</i> prove <i>her</i> own <i>acting dickey</i>, and then shall <i>she</i> have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.
    </li>
    <li>For every <i>homie</i> shall bear <i>her</i> own burden.
    </li>
    <li>Let <i>her</i> that is taught in the <i>lav</i> communicate unto <i>her</i> that teacheth in all <i>bona</i> <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Be not <i>mogued</i>; <i>Gloria</i> is not mocked: for whatsoever a <i>homie</i> soweth, that shall <i>she</i> also reap.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> that soweth to <i>her</i> flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but <i>she</i> that soweth to the <i>Fairy</i> shall of the <i>Fairy</i> reap life everlasting.
    </li>
    <li>And let us not be <i>a stretcher case</i> in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.
    </li>
    <li>As we have therefore opportunity, let us do <i>bona</i> unto all <i>homies</i>, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.
    </li>
    <li>Ye <i>varda</i> how large a letter I have <i>screeved</i> unto you with mine own <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>As many as <i>fancy</i> to make a <i>filly</i> shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be <i>roundhead</i>; only lest they should suffer <i>chivvying</i> for the cross of <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>nishta</i> they themselves who are <i>roundhead</i> keep the law; but <i>fancy</i> to have you <i>roundhead</i>, that they may <i>fabeness</i> in your flesh.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>Gloria</i> forbid that I should <i>fabeness</i>, save in the cross of our <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.

    <li>For in <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>nishta</i> circumcision availeth any <i>fakement</i>, <i>nishta</i> uncircumcision, but a new creature.

    <li>And as many as <i>mince</i> according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>From henceforth let no <i>homie</i> trouble me: for I bear in my <i>lucoddy</i> the marks of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i>.

    <li><i>Sisters</i>, the <i>gracie</i> of our <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> be with your <i>Fairy</i>. <i>Larlou</i>.
