    <h1>Philippians</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Pauline</i> and Timotheus, the <i>serving homies</i> of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, to all the saints in <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i> which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:
    </li>
    <li><i>Gracie</i> be unto you, and peace, from <i>Gloria</i> our <i>Auntie</i>, and from the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I thank my <i>Gloria</i> upon every remembrance of you,
    </li>
    <li>Always in every <i>meshigener muttering</i> of mine for you all making request with joy,
    </li>
    <li>For your fellowship in the <i>gossip</i> from the first <i>journo</i> until now;
    </li>
    <li>Being confident of this <i>dowry</i> <i>fakement</i>, that <i>she</i> which hath begun a <i>bona</i> <i>acting dickey</i> in you will perform it until the <i>journo</i> of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my <i>thumping cheat</i>; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the <i>gossip</i>, ye all are partakers of my <i>gracie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>Gloria</i> is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the <i>chutney locker</i> of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;
    </li>
    <li>That ye may approve <i>fakements</i> that are <i>fantabulosa</i>; that ye may be sincere and <i>nanti</i> offence till the <i>journo</i> of <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Being filled with the fruits of <i>bonaness</i>, which are by <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, unto the <i>fabeness</i> and praise of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But I would ye should understand, <i>sisters</i>, that the <i>fakements</i> which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the <i>gossip</i>;
    </li>
    <li>So that my bonds in <i>Crystal</i> are manifest in all the <i>dowry lattie</i>, and in all other places;
    </li>
    <li>And many of the <i>sisters</i> in the <i>Duchess</i>, waxing confident by my bonds, are <i>dowry</i> more bold to <i>cackle</i> the <i>lav</i> <i>nanti</i> fear.
    </li>
    <li>Some indeed <i>cackle</i> <i>Crystal</i> even of envy and strife; and some also of <i>bona</i> will:
    </li>
    <li>The <i>una</i> <i>cackle</i> <i>Crystal</i> of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:
    </li>
    <li>But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the <i>gossip</i>.
    </li>
    <li>What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or <i>no flies</i>, <i>Crystal</i> is <i>cackled</i>; and I therein do rejoice, <i>any road up</i>, and will rejoice.
    </li>
    <li>For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your <i>meshigener muttering</i>, and the supply of the <i>Fairy</i> of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>,
    </li>
    <li>According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in <i>nishter</i> I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also <i>Crystal</i> shall be magnified in my <i>lucoddy</i>, whether it be by life, or by <i>carking it</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For to me to live is <i>Crystal</i>, and to <i>cark it</i> is gain.
    </li>
    <li>But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my <i>acting dickey</i>: yet what I shall choose I wot not.
    </li>
    <li>For I am in a <i>hettie</i> betwixt <i>dewey</i>, having a <i>fancy</i> to <i>troll off</i>, and to be with <i>Crystal</i>; which is far <i>benar</i>:
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> to <i>lett</i> in the flesh is more needful for you.
    </li>
    <li>And having this confidence, I know that I shall <i>lett</i> and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;
    </li>
    <li>That your rejoicing may be more abundant in <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> for me by my <i>trolling</i> to you again.
    </li>
    <li>Only let your conversation be as it becometh the <i>gossip</i> of <i>Crystal</i>: that whether I <i>troll</i> and <i>varda</i> you, or else be absent, I may <i>aunt nell</i> of your affairs, that ye stand <i>nishta manjarry</i> in <i>una</i> <i>Fairy</i>, with <i>una</i> mind striving together for the faith of the <i>gossip</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And in <i>nishter</i> terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For unto you it is <i>parkered</i> in the behalf of <i>Crystal</i>, not only to believe on <i>her</i>, but also to suffer for <i>her</i> sake;
    </li>
    <li>Having the same conflict which ye <i>vardad</i> in me, and now <i>aunt nell</i> to be in me.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>If there be therefore any consolation in <i>Crystal</i>, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the <i>Fairy</i>, if any <i>chutney locker</i> and mercies,
    </li>
    <li>Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of <i>una</i> accord, of <i>una</i> mind.
    </li>
    <li>Let <i>nishter</i> be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other <i>benar</i> than themselves.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i> not every <i>homie</i> on <i>her</i> own <i>fakements</i>, but every <i>homie</i> also on the <i>fakements</i> of others.
    </li>
    <li>Let this mind be in you, which was also in <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Who, being in the form of <i>Gloria</i>, thought it not robbery to be equal with <i>Gloria</i>:
    </li>
    <li>But made himself of no reputation, and <i>lelled</i> upon <i>her</i> the form of a <i>serving homie</i>, and was made in the likeness of <i>homies</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And being found in fashion as a <i>homie</i>, <i>she</i> humbled himself, and became obedient unto <i>carking it</i>, even the <i>carking it</i> of the cross.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore <i>Gloria</i> also hath highly exalted <i>her</i>, and <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> a name which is above every name:
    </li>
    <li>That at the name of <i>Josie</i> every knee should bow, of <i>fakements</i> in heaven, and <i>fakements</i> in earth, and <i>fakements</i> under the earth;
    </li>
    <li>And that every <i>polari</i> should <i>dish</i> that <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> is <i>Duchess</i>, to the <i>fabeness</i> of <i>Gloria</i> the <i>Auntie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now <i>dowry</i> more in my absence, <i>acting dickey</i> out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
    </li>
    <li>For it is <i>Gloria</i> which worketh in you both to will and to do of <i>her</i> <i>bona</i> pleasure.
    </li>
    <li>Do all <i>fakements</i> <i>nanti</i> murmurings and disputings:
    </li>
    <li>That ye may be blameless and harmless, the <i>homie chavvies</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, <i>nanti</i> rebuke, in the midst of a <i>bent</i> and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as <i>sparkles</i> in the world;
    </li>
    <li>Holding forth the <i>lav</i> of life; that I may rejoice in the <i>journo</i> of <i>Crystal</i>, that I have not run in vain, <i>nishta</i> laboured in vain.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, and if I be offered upon the <i>parker</i> and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.
    </li>
    <li>For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.
    </li>
    <li>But I trust in the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> to <i>lau</i> Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of <i>bona</i> comfort, when I know your state.
    </li>
    <li>For I have no <i>homie</i> likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.
    </li>
    <li>For all <i>charper</i> their own, not the <i>fakements</i> which are <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>&#8216;s.
    </li>
    <li>But ye know the proof of <i>her</i>, that, as a <i>homie chavvie</i> with the <i>Auntie</i>, <i>she</i> hath served with me in the <i>gossip</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Her</i> therefore I hope to <i>lau</i> presently, so soon as I shall <i>varda</i> how it will <i>troll</i> with me.
    </li>
    <li>But I trust in the <i>Duchess</i> that I also myself shall <i>troll</i> shortly.
    </li>
    <li>Yet I supposed it necessary to <i>lau</i> to you Epaphroditus, my <i>sister</i>, and companion in <i>acting dickey</i>, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and <i>she</i> that ministered to my wants.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had <i>aunt nelled</i> that <i>she</i> had been sick.
    </li>
    <li>For indeed <i>she</i> was sick <i>ajax</i> unto <i>carking it</i>: but <i>Gloria</i> had mercy on <i>her</i>; and not on <i>her</i> only, but on me also, lest I should have <i>sharda</i> upon <i>sharda</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> therefore the more carefully, that, when ye <i>varda</i> <i>her</i> again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the <i>nanti dowry</i> <i>shardaful</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Lall</i> <i>her</i> therefore in the <i>Duchess</i> with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:
    </li>
    <li>Because for the <i>acting dickey</i> of <i>Crystal</i> <i>she</i> was <i>ajax</i> unto <i>carking it</i>, not regarding <i>her</i> life, to supply your lack of service toward me.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Finally, my <i>sisters</i>, rejoice in the <i>Duchess</i>. To <i>screeve</i> the same <i>fakements</i> to you, to me indeed is not <i>naff</i>, but for you it is safe.
    </li>
    <li><i>Gardy loo</i> of <i>women who are not conventionally attractive</i>, <i>gardy loo</i> of <i>nana</i> workers, <i>gardy loo</i> of the concision.
    </li>
    <li>For we are the circumcision, which worship <i>Gloria</i> in the <i>Fairy</i>, and rejoice in <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i>, and have no confidence in the flesh.
    </li>
    <li>Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other <i>homie</i> thinketh that <i>she</i> hath whereof <i>she</i> might trust in the flesh, I more:
    </li>
    <li><i>Roundhead</i> the <i>otterth</i> <i>journo</i>, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an <i>Kosher Homie</i> of the <i>Kosher Homies and Palones</i>; as <i>reefing</i> the law, a <i>lily law</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Concerning zeal, persecuting the <i>meshigener carsey</i>; <i>reefing</i> the <i>bonaness</i> which is in the law, blameless.
    </li>
    <li>But what <i>fakements</i> were gain to me, those I counted loss for <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> doubtless, and I count all <i>fakements</i> but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i> my <i>Duchess</i>: for whom I have suffered the loss of all <i>fakements</i>, and do count them but dung, that I may win <i>Crystal</i>,
    </li>
    <li>And be found in <i>her</i>, not having mine own <i>bonaness</i>, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of <i>Crystal</i>, the <i>bonaness</i> which is of <i>Gloria</i> by faith:
    </li>
    <li>That I may know <i>her</i>, and the power of <i>her</i> resurrection, and the fellowship of <i>her</i> sufferings, being made conformable unto <i>her</i> <i>carking it</i>;
    </li>
    <li>If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the <i>stiff</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Not as though I had already attained, either were already <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i>: but I <i>troll after</i> after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Sisters</i>, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this <i>una</i> <i>fakement</i> I do, forgetting those <i>fakements</i> which are behind, and reaching forth unto those <i>fakements</i> which are before,
    </li>
    <li>I press toward the <i>Marcia</i> for the prize of the high calling of <i>Gloria</i> in <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Let us therefore, as many as be <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i>, be thus minded: and if in any <i>fakement</i> ye be otherwise minded, <i>Gloria</i> shall reveal even this unto you.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, whereto we have already attained, let us <i>mince</i> by the same rule, let us mind the same <i>fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Sisters</i>, be followers together of me, and <i>Marcia</i> them which <i>mince</i> so as ye have us for an ensample.
    </li>
    <li>(For many <i>mince</i>, of whom I have <i>cackled</i> you often, and now <i>cackle</i> you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of <i>Crystal</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Whose end is destruction, whose <i>Gloria</i> is their belly, and whose <i>fabeness</i> is in their <i>scharda</i>, who mind earthly <i>fakements</i>. )
    </li>
    <li>For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we <i>varda</i> for the Saviour, the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Who shall change our vile <i>lucoddy</i>, that it may be fashioned like unto <i>her</i> <i>fabe</i> <i>lucoddy</i>, according to the working whereby <i>she</i> is able even to subdue all <i>fakements</i> unto himself.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Therefore, my <i>sisters</i> dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and <i>mudge</i>, so stand <i>nishta manjarry</i> in the <i>Duchess</i>, my dearly beloved.
    </li>
    <li>I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those <i>palones</i> which laboured with me in the <i>gossip</i>, with Clement also, and with other my fellowlabourers, whose names are in the <i>glossy</i> of life.
    </li>
    <li>Rejoice in the <i>Duchess</i> alway: and again I <i>cackle</i>, Rejoice.
    </li>
    <li>Let your moderation be known unto all <i>homies</i>. The <i>Duchess</i> is at <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Be careful for <i>nishter</i>; but in every <i>fakement</i> by <i>meshigener muttering</i> and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the peace of <i>Gloria</i>, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your <i>thumping cheats</i> and minds through <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Finally, <i>sisters</i>, whatsoever <i>fakements</i> are true, whatsoever <i>fakements</i> are honest, whatsoever <i>fakements</i> are just, whatsoever <i>fakements</i> are pure, whatsoever <i>fakements</i> are lovely, whatsoever <i>fakements</i> are of <i>bona</i> report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Those <i>fakements</i>, which ye have both learned, and <i>lalled</i>, and <i>aunt nelled</i>, and <i>vardad</i> in me, do: and the <i>Gloria</i> of peace shall be with you.
    </li>
    <li>But I rejoiced in the <i>Duchess</i> greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.
    </li>
    <li>Not that I <i>cackle</i> in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.
    </li>
    <li>I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all <i>fakements</i> I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.
    </li>
    <li>I can do all <i>fakements</i> through <i>Crystal</i> which strengtheneth me.
    </li>
    <li>Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.
    </li>
    <li>Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the <i>gossip</i>, when I <i>trolled off</i> from Macedonia, no <i>meshigener carsey</i> communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.
    </li>
    <li>For even in Thessalonica ye <i>laued</i> once and again unto my necessity.
    </li>
    <li>Not because I <i>fancy</i> a gift: but I <i>fancy</i> fruit that may abound to your account.
    </li>
    <li>But I have all, and abound: I am full, having <i>lalled</i> of Epaphroditus the <i>fakements</i> which were <i>laued</i> from you, an odour of a <i>bona</i> smell, a <i>parker</i> acceptable, wellpleasing to <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But my <i>Gloria</i> shall supply all your need according to <i>her</i> riches in <i>fabeness</i> by <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now unto <i>Gloria</i> and our <i>Auntie</i> be <i>fabeness</i> for ever and ever. <i>Larlou</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Salute every saint in <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i>. The <i>sisters</i> which are with me greet you.
    </li>
    <li>All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar&#8217;s household.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>gracie</i> of our <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> be with you all. <i>Larlou</i>.
