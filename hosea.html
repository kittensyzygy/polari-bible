    <h1>Hosea</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>The <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> that <i>trolled</i> unto Hosea, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, <i>dowriest homies</i> of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Joash, <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>The beginning of the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> by Hosea. And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> to Hosea, <i>troll</i>, <i>lell</i> unto thee a <i>palone affair</i> of <i>bitainedoms</i> and <i>chavvies</i> of <i>bitainedoms</i>: for the land hath committed <i>dowry</i> <i>bitainedom</i>, departing from the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> and <i>lelled</i> Gomer the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare <i>her</i> a <i>homie chavvie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>screech</i> <i>her</i> name Jezreel; for yet a <i>bijou</i> while, and I will <i>do the rights</i> the blood of Jezreel upon the <i>lattie</i> of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the <i>lattie</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass at that <i>journo</i>, that I will break the bow of Israel, in the valley of Jezreel.
    </li>
    <li>And she conceived again, and bare a <i>palone chavvie</i>. And <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>screech</i> her name Loruhamah: for I will <i>nishta</i> have mercy upon the <i>lattie</i> of Israel; but I will utterly <i>lell</i> them away.
    </li>
    <li>But I will have mercy upon the <i>lattie</i> of Judah, and will save them by the <i>Duchess</i> their <i>Gloria</i>, and will not save them by bow, <i>nishta</i> by <i>dowry efink</i>, <i>nishta</i> by battle, by horses, <i>nishta</i> by horsemen.
    </li>
    <li>Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a <i>homie chavvie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> <i>Gloria</i>, <i>screech</i> <i>her</i> name Loammi: for ye are not my <i>homies and palones</i>, and I will not be your <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Yet the number of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured <i>nishta</i> numbered; and it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, that in the place where it was <i>cackled</i> unto them, Ye are not my <i>homies and palones</i>, there it shall be <i>cackled</i> unto them, Ye are the <i>homie chavvies</i> of the living <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then shall the <i>chavvies</i> of Judah and the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves <i>una</i> <i>eke</i>, and they shall <i>troll</i> up out of the land: for <i>dowry</i> shall be the <i>journo</i> of Jezreel.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Cackle</i> ye unto your <i>sisters</i>, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.
    </li>
    <li>Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my <i>palone affair</i>, <i>nishta</i> am I her <i>homie affair</i>: let her therefore put away her <i>bitainedoms</i> out of her <i>vardaing</i>, and her adulteries from between her <i>foofs</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Lest I strip her <i>nanti zhoosh</i>, and set her as in the <i>journo</i> that she was born, and make her as a <i>nishta smoke</i>, and set her like a dry land, and <i>ferricadooza</i> her with thirst.
    </li>
    <li>And I will not have mercy upon her <i>chavvies</i>; for they be the <i>chavvies</i> of <i>bitainedoms</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For their mother hath played the <i>charvering donna</i>: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she <i>cackled</i>, I will <i>troll</i> after my <i>affairs</i>, that <i>parker</i> me my <i>pannan</i> and my <i>aqua</i>, my wool and my flax, mine <i>lube</i> and my <i>buvare</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore, <i>varda</i>, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.
    </li>
    <li>And she shall <i>troll after</i> after her <i>affairs</i>, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall <i>charper</i> them, but shall not find them: then shall she <i>cackle</i>, I will <i>troll</i> and <i>troll back to</i> my first <i>homie affair</i>; for then was it <i>benar</i> with me than now.
    </li>
    <li>For she did not know that I <i>parkered</i> her corn, and <i>sherry</i>, and <i>lube</i>, and multiplied her silver and <i>gelt</i>, which they prepared for Baal.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore will I return, and <i>lell</i> away my corn in the time thereof, and my <i>sherry</i> in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax <i>parkered</i> to cover her <i>nanti zhoosh</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And now will I discover her lewdness in the <i>vardaing</i> of her <i>affairs</i>, and none shall deliver her out of mine <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her <i>dowry munjarlee</i> days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn <i>dowry munjarlees</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And I will <i>battyfang</i> her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath <i>cackled</i>, These are my <i>parkerings</i> that my <i>affairs</i> have <i>parkered</i> me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall <i>jarry</i> them.
    </li>
    <li>And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned <i>smelly</i> to them, and she decked herself with her <i>aunt nelly fakes</i> and her <i>groinage</i>, and she <i>trolled</i> after her <i>affairs</i>, and forgat me, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore, <i>varda</i>, I will allure her, and <i>parker</i> her into the <i>nishta smoke</i>, and <i>cackle</i> comfortably unto her.
    </li>
    <li>And I will <i>parker</i> her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her <i>beandom</i>, and as in the <i>journo</i> when she <i>trolled</i> up out of the land of Egypt.
    </li>
    <li>And it shall be at that <i>journo</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, that thou shalt <i>screech</i> me Ishi; and shalt <i>screech</i> me <i>nishta</i> Baali.
    </li>
    <li>For I will <i>lell</i> away the names of Baalim out of her <i>screech</i>, and they shall <i>nishta</i> be remembered by their name.
    </li>
    <li>And in that <i>journo</i> will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping <i>fakements</i> of the ground: and I will break the bow and the <i>dowry efink</i> and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.
    </li>
    <li>And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; <i>any road up</i>, I will betroth thee unto me in <i>bonaness</i>, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.
    </li>
    <li>I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass in that <i>journo</i>, I will <i>aunt nell</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, I will <i>aunt nell</i> the heavens, and they shall <i>aunt nell</i> the earth;
    </li>
    <li>And the earth shall <i>aunt nell</i> the corn, and the <i>sherry</i>, and the <i>lube</i>; and they shall <i>aunt nell</i> Jezreel.
    </li>
    <li>And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will <i>cackle</i> to them which were not my <i>homies and palones</i>, Thou art my <i>homies and palones</i>; and they shall <i>cackle</i>, Thou art my <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> the <i>Duchess</i> unto me, <i>troll</i> yet, love a <i>palone</i> beloved of her <i>bencove</i>, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the <i>Duchess</i> toward the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, who <i>varda</i> to other gods, and love flagons of <i>sherry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley:
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>cackled</i> unto her, Thou shalt <i>lett</i> for me many days; <i>nishta</i> play the <i>charvering donna</i>, and <i>nishta</i> be for another <i>homie</i>: so will I also be for thee.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel shall <i>lett</i> many days <i>nanti</i> a <i>dowriest homie</i>, and <i>nanti</i> a <i>princess</i>, and <i>nanti</i> a <i>parker</i>, and <i>nanti</i> an image, and <i>nanti</i> an ephod, and <i>nanti</i> teraphim:
    </li>
    <li>Afterward shall the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel return, and <i>charper</i> the <i>Duchess</i> their <i>Gloria</i>, and <i>Davina</i> their <i>dowriest homie</i>; and shall fear the <i>Duchess</i> and <i>her</i> goodness in the latter days.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Aunt nell</i> the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, ye <i>chavvies</i> of Israel: for the <i>Duchess</i> hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, <i>nishta</i> mercy, <i>nishta</i> knowledge of <i>Gloria</i> in the land.
    </li>
    <li>By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood <i>reefeth</i> blood.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore shall the land mourn, and every <i>una</i> that <i>letteth</i> therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; <i>any road up</i>, the fishes of the sea also shall be <i>lelled</i> away.
    </li>
    <li>Yet let no <i>homie</i> strive, <i>nishta</i> reprove another: for thy <i>homies and palones</i> are as they that strive with the <i>godly homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore shalt thou fall in the <i>journo</i>, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the <i>nochy</i>, and I will <i>battyfang</i> thy mother.
    </li>
    <li>My <i>homies and palones</i> are <i>battyfanged</i> for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no <i>godly homie</i> to me: <i>vardaing</i> thou hast forgotten the law of thy <i>Gloria</i>, I will also forget thy <i>chavvies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>As they were increased, so they <i>kertervered</i> against me: therefore will I change their <i>fabeness</i> into <i>scharda</i>.
    </li>
    <li>They <i>jarry</i> up the <i>kertever</i> of my <i>homies and palones</i>, and they set their <i>thumping cheat</i> on their <i>codness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And there shall be, like <i>homies and palones</i>, like <i>godly homie</i>: and I will <i>zsa zsa</i> them for their ways, and <i>parkering</i> them their doings.
    </li>
    <li>For they shall <i>jarry</i>, and not have enough: they shall commit <i>bitainedom</i>, and shall not increase: because they have <i>dry</i> off to <i>lell</i> heed to the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Bitainedom</i> and <i>sherry</i> and new <i>sherry</i> <i>lell</i> away the <i>thumping cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li>My <i>homies and palones</i> ask counsel at their stocks, and their <i>trolling fakement</i> declareth unto them: for the <i>Fairy</i> of <i>bitainedoms</i> hath caused them to err, and they have <i>trolled</i> a <i>bitaining</i> from under their <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>They <i>parker</i> upon the tops of the mountains, and burn <i>smelly</i> upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof is <i>bona</i>: therefore your <i>palone chavvies</i> shall commit <i>bitainedom</i>, and your spouses shall commit adultery.
    </li>
    <li>I will not <i>zsa zsa</i> your <i>palone chavvies</i> when they commit <i>bitainedom</i>, <i>nishta</i> your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they <i>parker</i> with <i>charvering donnas</i>: therefore the <i>homies and palones</i> that doth not understand shall fall.
    </li>
    <li>Though thou, Israel, play the <i>charvering donna</i>, yet let not Judah offend; and <i>troll</i> not ye unto Gilgal, <i>nishta</i> <i>troll</i> ye up to Bethaven, <i>nishta</i> swear, The <i>Duchess</i> <i>letteth</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the <i>Duchess</i> will feed them as a lamb in a large place.
    </li>
    <li>Ephraim is joined to idols: let <i>her</i> alone.
    </li>
    <li>Their <i>buvare</i> is sour: they have committed <i>bitainedom</i> continually: her rulers with <i>scharda</i> do love, <i>parker</i> ye.
    </li>
    <li>The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their <i>parkers</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Aunt nell</i> ye this, O <i>godly homies</i>; and <i>aunt nell</i>, ye <i>lattie</i> of Israel; and <i>parker</i> ye <i>aunt nelling cheat</i>, O <i>lattie</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i>; for judgment is toward you, because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.
    </li>
    <li>And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I have been a rebuker of them all.
    </li>
    <li>I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest <i>bitainedom</i>, and Israel is defiled.
    </li>
    <li>They will not frame their doings to turn unto their <i>Gloria</i>: for the <i>Fairy</i> of <i>bitainedoms</i> is in the midst of them, and they have not known the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the pride of Israel doth testify to <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their <i>codness</i>: Judah also shall fall with them.
    </li>
    <li>They shall <i>troll</i> with their flocks and with their herds to <i>charper</i> the <i>Duchess</i>; but they shall not find <i>her</i>; <i>she</i> hath withdrawn himself from them.
    </li>
    <li>They have dealt treacherously against the <i>Duchess</i>: for they have begotten strange <i>chavvies</i>: now shall a month devour them with their portions.
    </li>
    <li>Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the <i>tooting fakement</i> in Ramah: <i>screech</i> aloud at Bethaven, after thee, O Benjamin.
    </li>
    <li>Ephraim shall be desolate in the <i>journo</i> of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>princesses</i> of Judah were like them that remove the bound: therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like <i>aqua</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because <i>she</i> willingly <i>minced</i> after the <i>butch lav</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the <i>lattie</i> of Judah as rottenness.
    </li>
    <li>When Ephraim <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i> <i>kerterver coddy</i>, and Judah <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i> wound, then <i>trolled</i> Ephraim to the Assyrian, and <i>laued</i> to <i>dowriest homie</i> Jareb: yet could <i>she</i> not heal you, <i>nishta</i> cure you of your wound.
    </li>
    <li>For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a <i>bean</i> lion to the <i>lattie</i> of Judah: I, even I, will tear and <i>troll away</i>; I will <i>lell</i> away, and none shall rescue <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I will <i>troll</i> and <i>troll back to</i> my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and <i>charper</i> my <i>eke</i>: in their affliction they will <i>charper</i> me early.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Troll</i>, and let us return unto the <i>Duchess</i>: for <i>she</i> hath torn, and <i>she</i> will heal us; <i>she</i> hath smitten, and <i>she</i> will bind us up.
    </li>
    <li>After <i>dewey</i> days will <i>she</i> revive us: in the third <i>journo</i> <i>she</i> will raise us up, and we shall live in <i>her</i> <i>vardaing</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then shall we know, if we <i>troll after</i> on to know the <i>Duchess</i>: <i>her</i> going forth is prepared as the morning; and <i>she</i> shall <i>troll</i> unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.
    </li>
    <li>O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have <i>ferricadoozed</i> them by the <i>lavs</i> of my <i>screech</i>: and thy judgments are as the <i>sparkle</i> that goeth forth.
    </li>
    <li>For I <i>fancied</i> mercy, and not <i>parker</i>; and the knowledge of <i>Gloria</i> more than burnt <i>parkerings</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But they like <i>homies</i> have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.
    </li>
    <li>Gilead is a <i>smoke</i> of them that <i>acting dickey</i> <i>codness</i>, and is <i>dingy</i> with blood.
    </li>
    <li>And as troops of robbers wait for a <i>homie</i>, so the company of <i>godly homies</i> murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness.
    </li>
    <li>I have <i>vardad</i> an horrible <i>fakement</i> in the <i>lattie</i> of Israel: there is the <i>bitainedom</i> of Ephraim, Israel is defiled.
    </li>
    <li>Also, O Judah, <i>she</i> hath set an harvest for thee, when I <i>trolled back</i> the captivity of my <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>When I would have healed Israel, then the <i>codness</i> of Ephraim was discovered, and the <i>naffness</i> of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the <i>sharpering homie</i> <i>trolleth</i> in, and the troop of robbers spoileth <i>nanti</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they consider not in their <i>thumping cheats</i> that I remember all their <i>naffness</i>: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my <i>eke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>They make the <i>dowriest homie</i> glad with their <i>naffness</i>, and the <i>princesses</i> with their lies.
    </li>
    <li>They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who ceaseth from raising after <i>she</i> hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened.
    </li>
    <li>In the <i>journo</i> of our <i>dowriest homie</i> the <i>princesses</i> have made <i>her</i> sick with <i>schooners</i> of <i>sherry</i>; <i>she</i> stretched out <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> with scorners.
    </li>
    <li>For they have made ready their <i>thumping cheat</i> like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the <i>nochy</i>; in the morning it burneth as a flaming <i>binco fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their <i>beaks</i>; all their <i>dowriest homies</i> are fallen: there is none among them that <i>screecheth</i> unto me.
    </li>
    <li>Ephraim, <i>she</i> hath mixed himself among the <i>homies and palones</i>; Ephraim is a cake not turned.
    </li>
    <li>Strangers have devoured <i>her</i> <i>butchness</i>, and <i>she</i> knoweth it not: <i>any road up</i>, gray <i>riah</i> are here and there upon <i>her</i>, yet <i>she</i> knoweth not.
    </li>
    <li>And the pride of Israel testifieth to <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>: and they <i>nix</i> <i>troll back to</i> the <i>Duchess</i> their <i>Gloria</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>charper</i> <i>her</i> for all this.
    </li>
    <li>Ephraim also is like a silly dove <i>nanti</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>: they <i>screech</i> to Egypt, they <i>troll</i> to Assyria.
    </li>
    <li>When they shall <i>troll</i>, I will spread my net upon them; I will <i>parker</i> them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their <i>punters</i> hath <i>aunt nelled</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have <i>cackled</i> lies against me.
    </li>
    <li>And they have not <i>screeched</i> unto me with their <i>thumping cheat</i>, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and <i>sherry</i>, and they rebel against me.
    </li>
    <li>Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me.
    </li>
    <li>They return, but not to the most High: they are like a deceitful bow: their <i>princesses</i> shall fall by the <i>dowry efink</i> for the rage of their <i>polari</i>: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Set the <i>tooting fakement</i> to thy <i>screech</i>. <i>She</i> shall <i>troll</i> as an eagle against the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.
    </li>
    <li>Israel shall <i>screech</i> unto me, My <i>Gloria</i>, we know thee.
    </li>
    <li>Israel hath cast off the <i>fakement</i> that is <i>bona</i>: the enemy shall pursue <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>They have set up <i>dowriest homies</i>, but not by me: they have made <i>princesses</i>, and I knew it not: of their silver and their <i>gelt</i> have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.
    </li>
    <li>Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off; mine <i>wild</i> is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency?
    </li>
    <li>For from Israel was it also: the workman made it; therefore it is not <i>Gloria</i>: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.
    </li>
    <li>For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk; the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall <i>jarry</i> it up.
    </li>
    <li>Israel is <i>jarried</i> up: now shall they be among the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> as a <i>fakement</i> wherein is no pleasure.
    </li>
    <li>For they are <i>trolled</i> up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired <i>affairs</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall <i>sharda</i> a <i>bijou</i> for the burden of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of <i>princesses</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Because Ephraim hath made many altars to <i>kertever</i>, altars shall be unto <i>her</i> to <i>kertever</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I have <i>screeved</i> to <i>her</i> the <i>dowry</i> <i>fakements</i> of my law, but they were counted as a strange <i>fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>They <i>parker</i> flesh for the <i>parkers</i> of mine <i>parkerings</i>, and <i>jarry</i> it; but the <i>Duchess</i> accepteth them not; now will <i>she</i> remember their <i>codness</i>, and visit their <i>kertervers</i>: they shall <i>troll back to</i> Egypt.
    </li>
    <li>For Israel hath forgotten <i>her</i> Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced <i>smokes</i>: but I will <i>lau</i> a <i>binco fakement</i> upon <i>her</i> <i>smokes</i>, and it shall devour the <i>dowry latties</i> thereof.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as other <i>homies and palones</i>: for thou hast <i>trolled</i> a <i>bitaining</i> from thy <i>Gloria</i>, thou hast loved a <i>parkering</i> upon every cornfloor.
    </li>
    <li>The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new <i>sherry</i> shall fail in her.
    </li>
    <li>They shall not <i>lett</i> in the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s land; but Ephraim shall <i>troll back to</i> Egypt, and they shall <i>jarry</i> <i>nanti sparkle</i> <i>fakements</i> in Assyria.
    </li>
    <li>They shall not offer <i>sherry</i> <i>parkerings</i> to the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>nishta</i> shall they be pleasing unto <i>her</i>: their <i>parkers</i> shall be unto them as the <i>pannan</i> of mourners; all that <i>jarry</i> thereof shall be <i>dingy</i>: for their <i>pannan</i> for their <i>nishta lucoddy</i> shall not <i>troll</i> into the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>What will ye do in the solemn <i>journo</i>, and in the <i>journo</i> of the <i>dowry munjarlee</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>?
    </li>
    <li>For, lo, they are <i>trolled</i> because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: the <i>dolly</i> places for their silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns shall be in their <i>bijoux tabernaclettes</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The days of visitation are <i>troll</i>, the days of recompence are <i>troll</i>; Israel shall know it: the prophet is a <i>bimbo</i>, the spiritual <i>homie</i> is mad, for the multitude of thine <i>codness</i>, and the <i>dowry</i> hatred.
    </li>
    <li>The watchman of Ephraim was with my <i>Gloria</i>: but the prophet is a snare of a fowler in all <i>her</i> ways, and hatred in the <i>lattie</i> of <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: therefore <i>she</i> will remember their <i>codness</i>, <i>she</i> will visit their <i>kertervers</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I found Israel like grapes in the <i>nishta smoke</i>; I <i>vardad</i> your <i>aunties</i> as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time: but they <i>trolled</i> to Baalpeor, and separated themselves unto that <i>scharda</i>; and their <i>dowry cods</i> were according as they loved.
    </li>
    <li>As for Ephraim, their <i>fabeness</i> shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception.
    </li>
    <li>Though they <i>parker</i> up their <i>chavvies</i>, yet will I bereave them, that there shall not be a <i>homie</i> <i>dry</i>: <i>any road up</i>, woe also to them when I <i>troll off</i> from them!
    </li>
    <li>Ephraim, as I <i>vardad</i> Tyrus, is planted in a <i>dolly</i> place: but Ephraim shall <i>parker</i> forth <i>her</i> <i>chavvies</i> to the murderer.
    </li>
    <li><i>Parker</i> them, O <i>Duchess</i>: what wilt thou <i>parker</i>? <i>parker</i> them a miscarrying womb and dry <i>foofs</i>.
    </li>
    <li>All their <i>naffness</i> is in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for the <i>naffness</i> of their doings I will drive them out of mine <i>lattie</i>, I will love them <i>nishta</i>: all their <i>princesses</i> are revolters.
    </li>
    <li>Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: <i>any road up</i>, though they <i>parker</i> forth, yet will I <i>ferricadooza</i> even the beloved fruit of their womb.
    </li>
    <li>My <i>Gloria</i> will cast them away, because they did not <i>aunt nell</i> unto <i>her</i>: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Israel is an empty vine, <i>she</i> <i>parkereth</i> forth fruit unto himself: according to the multitude of <i>her</i> fruit <i>she</i> hath increased the altars; according to the goodness of <i>her</i> land they have made goodly images.
    </li>
    <li>Their <i>thumping cheat</i> is <i>medzered</i>; now shall they be found faulty: <i>she</i> shall break down their altars, <i>she</i> shall spoil their images.
    </li>
    <li>For now they shall <i>cackle</i>, We have no <i>dowriest homie</i>, because we feared not the <i>Duchess</i>; what then should a <i>dowriest homie</i> do to us?
    </li>
    <li>They have <i>cackled</i> <i>lavs</i>, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.
    </li>
    <li>The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Bethaven: for the <i>homies and palones</i> thereof shall mourn over it, and the <i>godly homies</i> thereof that rejoiced on it, for the <i>fabeness</i> thereof, because it is <i>trolled off</i> from it.
    </li>
    <li>It shall be also <i>lelled</i> unto Assyria for a present to <i>dowriest homie</i> Jareb: Ephraim shall <i>lall</i> <i>scharda</i>, and Israel shall be ashamed of <i>her</i> own counsel.
    </li>
    <li>As for Samaria, her <i>dowriest homie</i> is cut off as the foam upon the <i>aqua</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The high places also of Aven, the <i>kertever</i> of Israel, shall be <i>battyfanged</i>: the thorn and the thistle shall <i>troll</i> up on their altars; and they shall <i>cackle</i> to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.
    </li>
    <li>O Israel, thou hast <i>kertervered</i> from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the <i>chavvies</i> of <i>codness</i> did not overtake them.
    </li>
    <li>It is in my <i>fancy</i> that I should chastise them; and the <i>homies and palones</i> shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in their <i>dewey</i> furrows.
    </li>
    <li>And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loveth to <i>mince</i> out the corn; but I passed over upon her <i>filly</i> neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, and Jacob shall break <i>her</i> clods.
    </li>
    <li>Sow to yourselves in <i>bonaness</i>, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to <i>charper</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, till <i>she</i> <i>troll</i> and rain <i>bonaness</i> upon you.
    </li>
    <li>Ye have plowed <i>naffness</i>, ye have reaped <i>codness</i>; ye have <i>jarried</i> the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy <i>homies and palones</i>, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Betharbel in the <i>journo</i> of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon her <i>chavvies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So shall Bethel do unto you because of your <i>dowry</i> <i>naffness</i>: in a morning shall the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel utterly be cut off.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>When Israel was a <i>chavvie</i>, then I loved <i>her</i>, and <i>screeched</i> my <i>homie chavvie</i> out of Egypt.
    </li>
    <li>As they <i>screeched</i> them, so they <i>trolled</i> from them: they sacrificed unto Baalim, and burned <i>smelly</i> to graven images.
    </li>
    <li>I taught Ephraim also to <i>troll</i>, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them.
    </li>
    <li>I drew them with cords of a <i>homie</i>, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that <i>lell</i> off the yoke on their jaws, and I <i>laued</i> <i>carnish</i> unto them.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> shall not return into the land of Egypt, and the Assyrian shall be <i>her</i> <i>dowriest homie</i>, because they refused to return.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowry efink</i> shall <i>lett</i> on <i>her</i> <i>smokes</i>, and shall consume <i>her</i> branches, and devour them, because of their own counsels.
    </li>
    <li>And my <i>homies and palones</i> are bent to backsliding from me: though they <i>screeched</i> them to the most High, none at all would exalt <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>How shall I <i>parker</i> thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine <i>thumping cheat</i> is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.
    </li>
    <li>I will not execute the fierceness of mine <i>wild</i>, I will not <i>troll back to</i> <i>battyfang</i> Ephraim: for I am <i>Gloria</i>, and not <i>homie</i>; the <i>fabulosa</i> <i>una</i> in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the <i>smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>They shall <i>mince</i> after the <i>Duchess</i>: <i>she</i> shall <i>butch shriek</i> like a lion: when <i>she</i> shall <i>butch shriek</i>, then the <i>chavvies</i> shall tremble from the west.
    </li>
    <li>They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will place them in their <i>latties</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the <i>lattie</i> of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with <i>Gloria</i>, and is <i>fabulous</i> with the saints.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Ephraim <i>jarrieth</i> on wind, and followeth after the east wind: <i>she</i> daily increaseth lies and desolation; and they do make a covenant with the Assyrians, and <i>lube</i> is <i>lelled</i> into Egypt.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> hath also a controversy with Judah, and will <i>zsa zsa</i> Jacob according to <i>her</i> ways; according to <i>her</i> doings will <i>she</i> recompense <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> <i>sister</i> by the heel in the womb, and by <i>her</i> <i>butchness</i> <i>she</i> had power with <i>Gloria</i>:
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, <i>she</i> had power over the <i>fairy</i>, and prevailed: <i>she</i> <i>parnied</i>, and made supplication unto <i>her</i>: <i>she</i> found <i>her</i> in Bethel, and there <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> with us;
    </li>
    <li>Even the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of hosts; the <i>Duchess</i> is <i>her</i> memorial.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore turn thou to thy <i>Gloria</i>: keep mercy and judgment and wait on thy <i>Gloria</i> continually.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> is a <i>bodega homie</i>, the balances of deceit are in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>: <i>she</i> loveth to oppress.
    </li>
    <li>And Ephraim <i>cackled</i>, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out substance: in all my <i>acting dickeys</i> they shall find none <i>codness</i> in me that were <i>kertever</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And I that am the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> from the land of Egypt will yet make thee to <i>lett</i> in <i>bijoux tabernaclettes</i>, as in the days of the solemn <i>dowry munjarlee</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I have also <i>cackled</i> by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets.
    </li>
    <li>Is there <i>codness</i> in Gilead? surely they are <i>spangly</i>: they <i>parker</i> bullocks in Gilgal; <i>any road up</i>, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the fields.
    </li>
    <li>And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a <i>palone affair</i>, and for a <i>palone affair</i> <i>she</i> kept sheep.
    </li>
    <li>And by a prophet the <i>Duchess</i> brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was <i>she</i> preserved.
    </li>
    <li>Ephraim provoked <i>her</i> to <i>wild</i> most bitterly: therefore shall <i>she</i> leave <i>her</i> blood upon <i>her</i>, and <i>her</i> reproach shall <i>her</i> <i>Duchess</i> return unto <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 13</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>When Ephraim <i>cackled</i> trembling, <i>she</i> exalted himself in Israel; but when <i>she</i> offended in Baal, <i>she</i> <i>carked it</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And now they <i>kertever</i> more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, and idols according to their own understanding, all of it the <i>acting dickey</i> of the craftsmen: they <i>cackle</i> of them, Let the <i>homies</i> that <i>parker</i> kiss the calves.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud and as the early dew that passeth away, as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.
    </li>
    <li>Yet I am the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no <i>Gloria</i> but me: for there is no saviour beside me.
    </li>
    <li>I did know thee in the <i>nishta smoke</i>, in the land of <i>dowry</i> <i>nishta parnie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and their <i>thumping cheat</i> was exalted; therefore have they forgotten me.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the way will I observe them:
    </li>
    <li>I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and will rend the caul of their <i>thumping cheat</i>, and there will I devour them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them.
    </li>
    <li>O Israel, thou hast <i>battyfanged</i> thyself; but in me is thine help.
    </li>
    <li>I will be thy <i>dowriest homie</i>: where is any other that may save thee in all thy <i>smokes</i>? and thy <i>beaks</i> of whom thou saidst, <i>parker</i> me a <i>dowriest homie</i> and <i>princesses</i>?
    </li>
    <li>I <i>parkered</i> thee a <i>dowriest homie</i> in mine <i>wild</i>, and <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> away in my wrath.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>codness</i> of Ephraim is bound up; <i>her</i> <i>kertever</i> is hid.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>shardas</i> of a travailing <i>palone</i> shall <i>troll</i> upon <i>her</i>: <i>she</i> is an unwise <i>homie chavvie</i>; for <i>she</i> should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of <i>chavvies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from <i>carking it</i>: O <i>carking it</i>, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine <i>ogles</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Though <i>she</i> be fruitful among <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, an east wind shall <i>troll</i>, the wind of the <i>Duchess</i> shall <i>troll</i> up from the <i>nishta smoke</i>, and <i>her</i> spring shall become dry, and <i>her</i> fountain shall be dried up: <i>she</i> shall spoil the <i>gelt</i> of all <i>dolly</i> <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her <i>Gloria</i>: they shall fall by the <i>dowry efink</i>: their <i>lullaby cheats</i> shall be dashed in pieces, and their <i>palones</i> <i>up the duff</i> shall be ripped up.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 14</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>O israel, return unto the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i>; for thou hast fallen by thine <i>codness</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Lell</i> with you <i>lavs</i>, and turn to the <i>Duchess</i>: <i>cackle</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>lell</i> away all <i>codness</i>, and <i>lall</i> us graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips.
    </li>
    <li>Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: <i>nishta</i> will we <i>cackle</i> any more to the <i>acting dickey</i> of our <i>fambles</i>, Ye are our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.
    </li>
    <li>I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine <i>wild</i> is turned away from <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I will be as the dew unto Israel: <i>she</i> shall grow as the lily, and cast forth <i>her</i> roots as Lebanon.
    </li>
    <li><i>Her</i> branches shall spread, and <i>her</i> beauty shall be as the olive tree, and <i>her</i> smell as Lebanon.
    </li>
    <li>They that <i>lett</i> under <i>her</i> shadow shall return; they shall revive as the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof shall be as the <i>sherry</i> of Lebanon.

    <li>Ephraim shall <i>cackle</i>, What have I to do any more with idols? I have <i>aunt nelled</i> <i>her</i>, and observed <i>her</i>: I am like a green fir tree. From me is thy fruit found.
    </li>
    <li>Who is wise, and <i>she</i> shall understand these <i>fakements</i>? prudent, and <i>she</i> shall know them? for the ways of the <i>Duchess</i> are <i>sweet</i>, and the just shall <i>mince</i> in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.
