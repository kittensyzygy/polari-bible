    <h1>Daniel</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah <i>trolled</i> Nebuchadnezzar <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>parkered</i> Jehoiakim <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah into <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>, with part of the <i>fakements</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>: which <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> into the land of Shinar to the <i>lattie</i> of <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i>; and <i>she</i> brought the <i>fakements</i> into the <i>gelt</i> <i>lattie</i> of <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Ashpenaz the master of <i>her</i> eunuchs, that <i>she</i> should <i>parker</i> certain of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, and of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>maria</i>, and of the <i>princesses</i>;
    </li>
    <li><i>Chavvies</i> in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>dowry lattie</i>, and whom they might teach the learning and the <i>polari</i> of the Chaldeans.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> appointed them a daily provision of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>carnish</i>, and of the <i>sherry</i> which <i>she</i> drank: so nourishing them <i>trey</i> years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now among these were of the <i>chavvies</i> of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:
    </li>
    <li>Unto whom the <i>princess</i> of the eunuchs <i>parkered</i> names: for <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.
    </li>
    <li>But Daniel purposed in <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> that <i>she</i> would not defile himself with the portion of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>carnish</i>, <i>nishta</i> with the <i>sherry</i> which <i>she</i> drank: therefore <i>she</i> requested of the <i>princess</i> of the eunuchs that <i>she</i> might not defile himself.
    </li>
    <li>Now <i>Gloria</i> had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the <i>princess</i> of the eunuchs.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>princess</i> of the eunuchs <i>cackled</i> unto Daniel, I fear my <i>Duchess</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>, who hath appointed your <i>carnish</i> and your <i>buvare</i>: for why should <i>she</i> <i>varda</i> your <i>ekes</i> worse liking than the <i>chavvies</i> which are of your sort? then shall ye make me endanger my <i>eke</i> to the <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> Daniel to Melzar, whom the <i>princess</i> of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
    </li>
    <li>Prove thy <i>serving homies</i>, I beseech thee, <i>dacha</i> days; and let them <i>parker</i> us pulse to <i>jarry</i>, and <i>aqua</i> to <i>buvare</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the <i>chavvies</i> that <i>jarry</i> of the portion of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>carnish</i>: and as thou <i>vardest</i>, deal with thy <i>serving homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So <i>she</i> consented to them in this matter, and proved them <i>dacha</i> days.
    </li>
    <li>And at the end of <i>dacha</i> days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the <i>chavvies</i> which did <i>jarry</i> the portion of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>carnish</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thus Melzar <i>lelled</i> away the portion of their <i>carnish</i>, and the <i>sherry</i> that they should <i>buvare</i>; and <i>parkered</i> them pulse.
    </li>
    <li>As for these <i>quarter</i> <i>chavvies</i>, <i>Gloria</i> <i>parkered</i> them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.
    </li>
    <li>Now at the end of the days that the <i>dowriest homie</i> had <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i> should <i>parker</i> them in, then the <i>princess</i> of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>dished the dirt</i> with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the <i>dowriest homie</i> enquired of them, <i>she</i> found them <i>dacha</i> times <i>benar</i> than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all <i>her</i> realm.
    </li>
    <li>And Daniel continued even unto the first year of <i>dowriest homie</i> Cyrus.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith <i>her</i> <i>Fairy</i> was troubled, and <i>her</i> <i>letty</i> brake from <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>dowriest homie</i> commanded to <i>screech</i> the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>her</i> dreams. So they <i>trolled</i> and stood before the <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my <i>Fairy</i> was troubled to know the dream.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> the Chaldeans to the <i>dowriest homie</i> in Syriack, O <i>dowriest homie</i>, live for ever: <i>cackle</i> thy <i>serving homies</i> the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>dowriest homie</i> answered and <i>cackled</i> to the Chaldeans, The <i>fakement</i> is <i>trolled</i> from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your <i>latties</i> shall be made a dunghill.
    </li>
    <li>But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall <i>lall</i> of me gifts and <i>parkerings</i> and <i>dowry</i> honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.
    </li>
    <li>They answered again and <i>cackled</i>, Let the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackle</i> <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i> the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>dowriest homie</i> answered and <i>cackled</i>, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye <i>varda</i> the <i>fakement</i> is <i>trolled</i> from me.
    </li>
    <li>But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but <i>una</i> decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt <i>lavs</i> to <i>cackle</i> before me, till the time be changed: therefore <i>cackle</i> me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.
    </li>
    <li>The Chaldeans answered before the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, There is not a <i>homie</i> upon the earth that can shew the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s matter: therefore there is no <i>dowriest homie</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, <i>nishta</i> ruler, that asked such <i>fakements</i> at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.
    </li>
    <li>And it is a rare <i>fakement</i> that the <i>dowriest homie</i> requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the <i>dowriest homie</i>, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.
    </li>
    <li>For this cause the <i>dowriest homie</i> was angry and <i>dowry</i> furious, and commanded to <i>battyfang</i> all the wise <i>homies</i> of Babylon.
    </li>
    <li>And the decree <i>trolled</i> forth that the wise <i>homies</i> should be <i>ferricadoozed</i>; and they sought Daniel and <i>her</i> fellows to be <i>ferricadoozed</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>charpering homie</i>, which was <i>trolled</i> forth to <i>ferricadooza</i> the wise <i>homies</i> of Babylon:
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> answered and <i>cackled</i> to Arioch the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the <i>dowriest homie</i>? Then Arioch made the <i>fakement</i> known to Daniel.
    </li>
    <li>Then Daniel <i>trolled</i> in, and <i>fancied</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> that <i>she</i> would <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> time, and that <i>she</i> would shew the <i>dowriest homie</i> the interpretation.
    </li>
    <li>Then Daniel <i>trolled</i> to <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>, and made the <i>fakement</i> known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, <i>her</i> companions:
    </li>
    <li>That they would <i>fancy</i> mercies of the <i>Gloria</i> of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and <i>her</i> fellows should not perish with the <i>lettie</i> of the wise <i>homies</i> of Babylon.
    </li>
    <li>Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a <i>nochy</i> vision. Then Daniel <i>fabed</i> the <i>Gloria</i> of heaven.
    </li>
    <li>Daniel answered and <i>cackled</i>, <i>fabed</i> be the name of <i>Gloria</i> for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are <i>her</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> changeth the times and the seasons: <i>she</i> removeth <i>dowriest homies</i>, and setteth up <i>dowriest homies</i>: <i>she</i> giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> revealeth the deep and secret <i>fakements</i>: <i>she</i> knoweth what is in the <i>munge</i>, and the <i>sparkle</i> <i>letteth</i> with <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou <i>Gloria</i> of my <i>aunties</i>, who hast <i>parkered</i> me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we <i>fancied</i> of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s matter.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore Daniel <i>trolled</i> in unto Arioch, whom the <i>dowriest homie</i> had ordained to <i>battyfang</i> the wise <i>homies</i> of Babylon: <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> and <i>cackled</i> thus unto <i>her</i>; <i>battyfang</i> not the wise <i>homies</i> of Babylon: <i>parker</i> me in before the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and I will shew unto the <i>dowriest homie</i> the interpretation.
    </li>
    <li>Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the <i>dowriest homie</i> in haste, and <i>cackled</i> thus unto <i>her</i>, I have found a <i>homie</i> of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the <i>dowriest homie</i> the interpretation.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>dowriest homie</i> answered and <i>cackled</i> to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have <i>vardad</i>, and the interpretation thereof?
    </li>
    <li>Daniel answered in the presence of the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, The secret which the <i>dowriest homie</i> hath demanded cannot the wise <i>homies</i>, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>;
    </li>
    <li>But there is a <i>Gloria</i> in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the <i>dowriest homie</i> Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy <i>eke</i> upon thy bed, are these;
    </li>
    <li>As for thee, O <i>dowriest homie</i>, thy thoughts <i>trolled</i> into thy mind upon thy bed, what should <i>troll</i> to pass hereafter: and <i>she</i> that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall <i>troll</i> to pass.
    </li>
    <li>But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy <i>thumping cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thou, O <i>dowriest homie</i>, sawest, and <i>varda</i> a <i>dowry</i> image. This <i>dowry</i> image, whose brightness was <i>fantabulosa</i>, stood before thee; and the form thereof was <i>nanna</i>.
    </li>
    <li>This image&#8217;s <i>eke</i> was of <i>bona</i> <i>gelt</i>, <i>her</i> breast and <i>her</i> arms of silver, <i>her</i> belly and <i>her</i> thighs of brass,
    </li>
    <li><i>Her</i> <i>scotches</i> of iron, <i>her</i> <i>plates</i> part of iron and part of clay.
    </li>
    <li>Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out <i>nanti</i> <i>fambles</i>, which <i>slapped</i> the image upon <i>her</i> <i>plates</i> that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces.
    </li>
    <li>Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the <i>gelt</i>, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind <i>lelled</i> them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that <i>slapped</i> the image became a <i>dowry</i> mountain, and filled the whole earth.
    </li>
    <li>This is the dream; and we will <i>cackle</i> the interpretation thereof before the <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thou, O <i>dowriest homie</i>, art a <i>dowriest homie</i> of <i>dowriest homies</i>: for the <i>Gloria</i> of heaven hath <i>parkered</i> thee a kingdom, power, and <i>butchness</i>, and <i>fabeness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And wheresoever the <i>chavvies</i> of <i>homies</i> <i>lett</i>, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> into thine <i>famble</i>, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this <i>eke</i> of <i>gelt</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>quarter</i> kingdom shall be <i>butch</i> as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all <i>fakements</i>: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.
    </li>
    <li>And whereas thou sawest the <i>plates</i> and toes, part of potters&#8217; clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be <i>medzered</i>; but there shall be in it of the <i>butchness</i> of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.
    </li>
    <li>And as the toes of the <i>plates</i> were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly <i>butch</i>, and partly broken.
    </li>
    <li>And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the <i>maria</i> of <i>homies</i>: but they shall not cleave <i>una</i> to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.
    </li>
    <li>And in the days of these <i>dowriest homies</i> shall the <i>Gloria</i> of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be <i>battyfanged</i>: and the kingdom shall not be <i>dry</i> to other <i>homies and palones</i>, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.
    </li>
    <li>Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain <i>nanti</i> <i>fambles</i>, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the <i>gelt</i>; the <i>dowry</i> <i>Gloria</i> hath made known to the <i>dowriest homie</i> what shall <i>troll</i> to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>dowriest homie</i> Nebuchadnezzar fell upon <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and <i>bona</i> odours unto <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>dowriest homie</i> answered unto Daniel, and <i>cackled</i>, Of a truth it is, that your <i>Gloria</i> is a <i>Gloria</i> of gods, and a <i>Duchess</i> of <i>dowriest homies</i>, and a revealer of secrets, <i>vardaing</i> thou couldest reveal this secret.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>dowriest homie</i> made Daniel a <i>dowry</i> <i>homie</i>, and <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> many <i>dowry</i> gifts, and made <i>her</i> ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and <i>dowriest</i> of the governors over all the wise <i>homies</i> of Babylon.
    </li>
    <li>Then Daniel requested of the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and <i>she</i> set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Nebuchadnezzar the <i>dowriest homie</i> made an image of <i>gelt</i>, whose height was <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> cubits, and the breadth thereof <i>sey</i> cubits: <i>she</i> set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.
    </li>
    <li>Then Nebuchadnezzar the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>laued</i> to gather together the <i>princesses</i>, the governors, and the captains, the <i>beaks</i>, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to <i>troll</i> to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the <i>dowriest homie</i> had set up.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>princesses</i>, the governors, and captains, the <i>beaks</i>, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the <i>dowriest homie</i> had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
    </li>
    <li>Then an herald <i>screeched</i> aloud, To you it is commanded, O <i>homies and palones</i>, nations, and languages,
    </li>
    <li>That at what time ye <i>aunt nell</i> the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the <i>dowriest homie</i> hath set up:
    </li>
    <li>And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore at that time, when all the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, all the <i>homies and palones</i>, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the <i>dowriest homie</i> had set up.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans <i>trolled</i> near, and accused the <i>kosher homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>They <i>cackled</i> and <i>cackled</i> to the <i>dowriest homie</i> Nebuchadnezzar, O <i>dowriest homie</i>, live for ever.
    </li>
    <li>Thou, O <i>dowriest homie</i>, hast made a decree, that every <i>homie</i> that shall <i>aunt nell</i> the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and worship the golden image:
    </li>
    <li>And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, that <i>she</i> should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
    </li>
    <li>There are certain <i>kosher homies</i> whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these <i>homies</i>, O <i>dowriest homie</i>, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, <i>nishta</i> worship the golden image which thou hast set up.
    </li>
    <li>Then Nebuchadnezzar in <i>her</i> rage and fury commanded to <i>parker</i> Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these <i>homies</i> before the <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Nebuchadnezzar <i>cackled</i> and <i>cackled</i> unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, <i>nix</i> ye serve my gods, <i>nishta</i> worship the golden image which I have set up?
    </li>
    <li>Now if ye be ready that at what time ye <i>aunt nell</i> the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that <i>Gloria</i> that shall deliver you out of my <i>fambles</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and <i>cackled</i> to the <i>dowriest homie</i>, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter.
    </li>
    <li>If it be so, our <i>Gloria</i> whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and <i>she</i> will deliver us out of thine <i>famble</i>, O <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But if not, be it known unto thee, O <i>dowriest homie</i>, that we will not serve thy gods, <i>nishta</i> worship the golden image which thou hast set up.
    </li>
    <li>Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of <i>her</i> visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: therefore <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, and commanded that they should heat the furnace <i>una</i> <i>setter</i> times more than it was wont to be heated.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> commanded the most <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i> that were in <i>her</i> army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.
    </li>
    <li>Then these <i>homies</i> were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other <i>frocks</i>, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore because the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>butch lav</i> was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flames of the <i>binco fakement</i> <i>ferricadoozaed</i> those <i>homies</i> that <i>lelled</i> up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
    </li>
    <li>And these <i>trey</i> <i>homies</i>, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
    </li>
    <li>Then Nebuchadnezzar the <i>dowriest homie</i> was astonied, and rose up in haste, and <i>cackled</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> counsellors, Did not we cast <i>trey</i> <i>homies</i> bound into the midst of the <i>binco fakement</i>? They answered and <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>, True, O <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> answered and <i>cackled</i>, Lo, I <i>varda</i> <i>quarter</i> <i>homies</i> loose, <i>mincing</i> in the midst of the <i>binco fakement</i>, and they have no hurt; and the form of the <i>quarter</i> is like the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then Nebuchadnezzar <i>trolled</i> near to the <i>screech</i> of the burning fiery furnace, and <i>cackled</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye <i>serving homies</i> of the most high <i>Gloria</i>, <i>troll</i> forth, and <i>troll</i> hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, <i>trolled</i> forth of the midst of the <i>binco fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>princesses</i>, governors, and captains, and the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s counsellors, being gathered together, <i>vardad</i> these <i>homies</i>, upon whose bodies the <i>binco fakement</i> had no power, <i>nishta</i> was an <i>riah</i> of their <i>eke</i> singed, <i>nishta</i> were their coats changed, <i>nishta</i> the smell of <i>binco fakement</i> had passed on them.
    </li>
    <li>Then Nebuchadnezzar <i>cackled</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>fabed</i> be the <i>Gloria</i> of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> <i>fairy</i>, and <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i> that trusted in <i>her</i>, and have changed the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lav</i>, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve <i>nishta</i> worship any <i>Gloria</i>, except their own <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore I make a decree, That every <i>homies and palones</i>, nation, and language, which <i>cackle</i> any <i>fakement</i> amiss against the <i>Gloria</i> of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their <i>latties</i> shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other <i>Gloria</i> that can deliver after this sort.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>dowriest homie</i> promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Nebuchadnezzar the <i>dowriest homie</i>, unto all <i>homies and palones</i>, nations, and languages, that <i>lett</i> in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.
    </li>
    <li>I thought it <i>bona</i> to shew the signs and wonders that the high <i>Gloria</i> hath wrought toward me.
    </li>
    <li>How <i>dowry</i> are <i>her</i> signs! and how <i>dowry butch</i> are <i>her</i> wonders! <i>her</i> kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and <i>her</i> dominion is from generation to generation.
    </li>
    <li>I Nebuchadnezzar was at <i>lettie</i> in mine <i>lattie</i>, and flourishing in my <i>dowry lattie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>I <i>vardad</i> a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my <i>eke</i> troubled me.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore made I a decree to <i>parker</i> in all the wise <i>homies</i> of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>trolled</i> in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I <i>cackled</i> the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.
    </li>
    <li>But at the last Daniel <i>trolled</i> in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my <i>Gloria</i>, and in whom is the <i>Fairy</i> of the <i>fabulosa</i> gods: and before <i>her</i> I <i>cackled</i> the dream, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the <i>Fairy</i> of the <i>fabulosa</i> gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, <i>cackle</i> me the visions of my dream that I have <i>vardad</i>, and the interpretation thereof.
    </li>
    <li>Thus were the visions of mine <i>eke</i> in my bed; I <i>vardad</i>, and <i>varda</i> a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was <i>dowry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The tree grew, and was <i>butch</i>, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the <i>vardaing</i> thereof to the end of all the earth:
    </li>
    <li>The leaves thereof were <i>filly</i>, and the fruit thereof <i>dowry</i>, and in it was <i>carnish</i> for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven <i>letted</i> in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it.
    </li>
    <li>I <i>vardad</i> in the visions of my <i>eke</i> upon my bed, and, <i>varda</i>, a watcher and an <i>fabulosa</i> <i>una</i> <i>trolled</i> down from heaven;
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> <i>screeched</i> aloud, and <i>cackled</i> thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off <i>her</i> branches, shake off <i>her</i> leaves, and scatter <i>her</i> fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from <i>her</i> branches:
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> leave the stump of <i>her</i> roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let <i>her</i> portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth:
    </li>
    <li>Let <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> be changed from <i>homie</i>&#8216;s, and let a beast&#8217;s <i>thumping cheat</i> be <i>parkered</i> unto <i>her</i>; and let <i>setter</i> times <i>troll over</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the <i>lav</i> of the <i>fabulosa</i> ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of <i>homies</i>, and giveth it to whomsoever <i>she</i> will, and setteth up over it the basest of <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>This dream I <i>dowriest homie</i> Nebuchadnezzar have <i>vardad</i>. Now thou, O Belteshazzar, <i>screech</i> the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the wise <i>homies</i> of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation: but thou art able; for the <i>Fairy</i> of the <i>fabulosa</i> gods is in thee.
    </li>
    <li>Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for <i>una</i> hour, and <i>her</i> thoughts troubled <i>her</i>. The <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and <i>cackled</i>, My <i>Duchess</i>, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies.
    </li>
    <li>The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was <i>butch</i>, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the <i>vardaing</i> thereof to all the earth;
    </li>
    <li>Whose leaves were <i>filly</i>, and the fruit thereof <i>dowry</i>, and in it was <i>carnish</i> for all; under which the beasts of the field <i>letted</i>, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation:
    </li>
    <li>It is thou, O <i>dowriest homie</i>, that art grown and become <i>butch</i>: for thy <i>dowriness</i> is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.
    </li>
    <li>And whereas the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>vardad</i> a watcher and an <i>fabulosa</i> <i>una</i> <i>trolling</i> down from heaven, and <i>cackling</i>, Hew the tree down, and <i>battyfang</i> it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let <i>her</i> portion be with the beasts of the field, till <i>setter</i> times <i>troll over</i> <i>her</i>;
    </li>
    <li>This is the interpretation, O <i>dowriest homie</i>, and this is the decree of the most High, which is <i>troll</i> upon my <i>Duchess</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>:
    </li>
    <li>That they shall drive thee from <i>homies</i>, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to <i>jarry</i> grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and <i>setter</i> times shall <i>troll over</i> thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of <i>homies</i>, and giveth it to whomsoever <i>she</i> will.
    </li>
    <li>And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore, O <i>dowriest homie</i>, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy <i>kertervers</i> by <i>bonaness</i>, and thine <i>cods</i> by shewing mercy to the <i>nanti dinarly</i>; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.
    </li>
    <li>All this <i>trolled</i> upon the <i>dowriest homie</i> Nebuchadnezzar.
    </li>
    <li>At the end of <i>kenza</i> months <i>she</i> <i>minced</i> in the <i>dowry lattie</i> of the kingdom of Babylon.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Is not this <i>dowry</i> Babylon, that I have built for the <i>lattie</i> of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my <i>fabularity</i>?
    </li>
    <li>While the <i>lav</i> was in the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>screech</i>, there fell a <i>cackling fakement</i> from heaven, <i>cackling</i>, O <i>dowriest homie</i> Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is <i>cackled</i>; The kingdom is <i>trolled off</i> from thee.
    </li>
    <li>And they shall drive thee from <i>homies</i>, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to <i>jarry</i> grass as oxen, and <i>setter</i> times shall <i>troll over</i> thee, until thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of <i>homies</i>, and giveth it to whomsoever <i>she</i> will.
    </li>
    <li>The same hour was the <i>fakement</i> fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and <i>she</i> was driven from <i>homies</i>, and did <i>jarry</i> grass as oxen, and <i>her</i> <i>lucoddy</i> was wet with the dew of heaven, till <i>her</i> <i>riah</i> were grown like eagles&#8217; feathers, and <i>her</i> nails like birds&#8217; claws.
    </li>
    <li>And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine <i>ogles</i> unto heaven, and mine understanding <i>trolled back</i> unto me, and I <i>fabed</i> the most High, and I praised and honoured <i>her</i> that <i>letteth</i> for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and <i>her</i> kingdom is from generation to generation:
    </li>
    <li>And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as <i>nishter</i>: and <i>she</i> doeth according to <i>her</i> will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>, or <i>cackle</i> unto <i>her</i>, What doest thou?
    </li>
    <li>At the same time my reason <i>trolled back</i> unto me; and for the <i>fabeness</i> of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness <i>trolled back</i> unto me; and my counsellors and my <i>ladies</i> sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and <i>fantabulosa</i> <i>fabularity</i> was added unto me.
    </li>
    <li>Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the <i>dowriest homie</i> of heaven, all whose works are truth, and <i>her</i> ways judgment: and those that <i>mince</i> in pride <i>she</i> is able to abase.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Belshazzar the <i>dowriest homie</i> made a <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry munjarlee</i> to a <i>mille</i> of <i>her</i> <i>ladies</i>, and drank <i>sherry</i> before the <i>mille</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Belshazzar, whiles <i>she</i> tasted the <i>sherry</i>, commanded to <i>parker</i> the golden and silver <i>fakements</i> which <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> Nebuchadnezzar had <i>lelled</i> out of the <i>holy carsey</i> which was in Jerusalem; that the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>princesses</i>, <i>her</i> <i>palone affairs</i>, and <i>her</i> concubines, might <i>buvare</i> therein.
    </li>
    <li>Then they brought the golden <i>fakements</i> that were <i>lelled</i> out of the <i>holy carsey</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> which was at Jerusalem; and the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>princesses</i>, <i>her</i> <i>palone affairs</i>, and <i>her</i> concubines, drank in them.
    </li>
    <li>They drank <i>sherry</i>, and praised the gods of <i>gelt</i>, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.
    </li>
    <li>In the same hour <i>trolled</i> forth <i>luppers</i> of a <i>homie</i>&#8216;s <i>famble</i>, and <i>screeved</i> over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>dowry lattie</i>: and the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>vardad</i> the part of the <i>famble</i> that <i>screeved</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s countenance was changed, and <i>her</i> thoughts troubled <i>her</i>, so that the joints of <i>her</i> loins were loosed, and <i>her</i> knees <i>slapped</i> <i>una</i> against another.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>screeched</i> aloud to <i>parker</i> in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i>, and <i>cackled</i> to the wise <i>homies</i> of Babylon, Whosoever shall <i>varda the lavs</i> this <i>screeving</i>, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of <i>gelt</i> about <i>her</i> neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>trolled</i> in all the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s wise <i>homies</i>: but they could not <i>varda the lavs</i> the <i>screeving</i>, <i>nishta</i> make known to the <i>dowriest homie</i> the interpretation thereof.
    </li>
    <li>Then was <i>dowriest homie</i> Belshazzar greatly troubled, and <i>her</i> countenance was changed in <i>her</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>ladies</i> were astonied.
    </li>
    <li>Now the <i>dowriest palone</i> by reason of the <i>lavs</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> and <i>her</i> <i>ladies</i> <i>trolled</i> into the banquet <i>lattie</i>: and the <i>dowriest palone</i> <i>cackled</i> and <i>cackled</i>, O <i>dowriest homie</i>, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, <i>nishta</i> let thy countenance be changed:
    </li>
    <li>There is a <i>homie</i> in thy kingdom, in whom is the <i>Fairy</i> of the <i>fabulosa</i> gods; and in the days of thy <i>Auntie</i> <i>sparkle</i> and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in <i>her</i>; whom the <i>dowriest homie</i> Nebuchadnezzar thy <i>Auntie</i>, the <i>dowriest homie</i>, I <i>cackle</i>, thy <i>Auntie</i>, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;
    </li>
    <li>Forasmuch as an <i>fantabulosa</i> <i>Fairy</i>, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the <i>dowriest homie</i> named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be <i>screeched</i>, and <i>she</i> will shew the interpretation.
    </li>
    <li>Then was Daniel brought in before the <i>dowriest homie</i>. And the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i> and <i>cackled</i> unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the <i>chavvies</i> of the captivity of Judah, whom the <i>dowriest homie</i> my <i>Auntie</i> brought out of Jewry?
    </li>
    <li>I have even <i>aunt nelled</i> of thee, that the <i>Fairy</i> of the gods is in thee, and that <i>sparkle</i> and understanding and <i>fantabulosa</i> wisdom is found in thee.
    </li>
    <li>And now the wise <i>homies</i>, the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should <i>varda the lavs</i> this <i>screeving</i>, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof: but they could not shew the interpretation of the <i>fakement</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And I have <i>aunt nelled</i> of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst <i>varda the lavs</i> the <i>screeving</i>, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of <i>gelt</i> about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.
    </li>
    <li>Then Daniel answered and <i>cackled</i> before the <i>dowriest homie</i>, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and <i>parker</i> thy <i>parkerings</i> to another; yet I will <i>varda the lavs</i> the <i>screeving</i> unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and make known to <i>her</i> the interpretation.
    </li>
    <li>O thou <i>dowriest homie</i>, the most high <i>Gloria</i> <i>parkered</i> Nebuchadnezzar thy <i>Auntie</i> a kingdom, and <i>fabularity</i>, and <i>fabeness</i>, and honour:
    </li>
    <li>And for the <i>fabularity</i> that <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i>, all <i>homies and palones</i>, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before <i>her</i>: whom <i>she</i> would <i>she</i> <i>ferricadoozaed</i>; and whom <i>she</i> would <i>she</i> kept alive; and whom <i>she</i> would <i>she</i> set up; and whom <i>she</i> would <i>she</i> put down.
    </li>
    <li>But when <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> was lifted up, and <i>her</i> mind hardened in pride, <i>she</i> was deposed from <i>her</i> kingly throne, and they <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> <i>fabeness</i> from <i>her</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> was driven from the <i>homie chavvies</i> of <i>homies</i>; and <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> was made like the beasts, and <i>her</i> dwelling was with the wild asses: they fed <i>her</i> with grass like oxen, and <i>her</i> <i>lucoddy</i> was wet with the dew of heaven; till <i>she</i> knew that the most high <i>Gloria</i> ruled in the kingdom of <i>homies</i>, and that <i>she</i> appointeth over it whomsoever <i>she</i> will.
    </li>
    <li>And thou <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine <i>thumping cheat</i>, though thou knewest all this;
    </li>
    <li>But hast lifted up thyself against the <i>Duchess</i> of heaven; and they have brought the <i>fakements</i> of <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i> before thee, and thou, and thy <i>ladies</i>, thy <i>palone affairs</i>, and thy concubines, have <i>bevvied</i> <i>sherry</i> in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and <i>gelt</i>, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which <i>varda</i> not, <i>nishta</i> <i>aunt nell</i>, <i>nishta</i> know: and the <i>Gloria</i> in whose <i>famble</i> thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified:
    </li>
    <li>Then was the part of the <i>famble</i> <i>laued</i> from <i>her</i>; and this <i>screeving</i> was <i>screeved</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And this is the <i>screeving</i> that was <i>screeved</i>, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.
    </li>
    <li>This is the interpretation of the <i>fakement</i>: MENE; <i>Gloria</i> hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it.
    </li>
    <li>TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.
    </li>
    <li>PERES; Thy kingdom is <i>medzered</i>, and <i>parkered</i> to the Medes and Persians.
    </li>
    <li>Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and put a chain of <i>gelt</i> about <i>her</i> neck, and made a proclamation concerning <i>her</i>, that <i>she</i> should be the third ruler in the kingdom.
    </li>
    <li>In that <i>nochy</i> was Belshazzar the <i>dowriest homie</i> of the Chaldeans <i>ferricadoozed</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Darius the Median <i>lelled</i> the kingdom, being about <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> and <i>dewey</i> years <i>badge</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an <i>chenter</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i> <i>princesses</i>, which should be over the whole kingdom;
    </li>
    <li>And over these <i>trey</i> presidents; of whom Daniel was first: that the <i>princesses</i> might <i>parker</i> accounts unto them, and the <i>dowriest homie</i> should have no damage.
    </li>
    <li>Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and <i>princesses</i>, because an <i>fantabulosa</i> <i>Fairy</i> was in <i>her</i>; and the <i>dowriest homie</i> thought to set <i>her</i> over the whole realm.
    </li>
    <li>Then the presidents and <i>princesses</i> sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion <i>nishta</i> fault; forasmuch as <i>she</i> was <i>fabulous</i>, <i>nishta</i> was there any error or fault found in <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> these <i>homies</i>, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against <i>her</i> concerning the law of <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then these presidents and <i>princesses</i> assembled together to the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and <i>cackled</i> thus unto <i>her</i>, <i>dowriest homie</i> Darius, live for ever.
    </li>
    <li>All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the <i>princesses</i>, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any <i>Gloria</i> or <i>homie</i> for <i>trey dacha</i> days, save of thee, O <i>dowriest homie</i>, <i>she</i> shall be cast into the den of lions.
    </li>
    <li>Now, O <i>dowriest homie</i>, establish the decree, and sign the <i>screeving</i>, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore <i>dowriest homie</i> Darius signed the <i>screeving</i> and the decree.
    </li>
    <li>Now when Daniel knew that the <i>screeving</i> was signed, <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> into <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>; and <i>her</i> windows being open in <i>her</i> <i>booth</i> toward Jerusalem, <i>she</i> kneeled upon <i>her</i> knees <i>trey</i> times a <i>journo</i>, and prayed, and <i>parkered</i> thanks before <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i>, as <i>she</i> did aforetime.
    </li>
    <li>Then these <i>homies</i> assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then they <i>trolled</i> near, and <i>cackled</i> before the <i>dowriest homie</i> concerning the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every <i>homie</i> that shall ask a petition of any <i>Gloria</i> or <i>homie</i> within <i>trey dacha</i> days, save of thee, O <i>dowriest homie</i>, shall be cast into the den of lions? The <i>dowriest homie</i> answered and <i>cackled</i>, The <i>fakement</i> is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.
    </li>
    <li>Then answered they and <i>cackled</i> before the <i>dowriest homie</i>, That Daniel, which is of the <i>chavvies</i> of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O <i>dowriest homie</i>, <i>nishta</i> the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh <i>her</i> petition <i>trey</i> times a <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>dowriest homie</i>, when <i>she</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> these <i>lavs</i>, was sore displeased with himself, and set <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> on Daniel to deliver <i>her</i>: and <i>she</i> laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then these <i>homies</i> assembled unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>, Know, O <i>dowriest homie</i>, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree <i>nishta</i> statute which the <i>dowriest homie</i> establisheth may be changed.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>dowriest homie</i> commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast <i>her</i> into the den of lions. Now the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i> and <i>cackled</i> unto Daniel, Thy <i>Gloria</i> whom thou servest continually, <i>she</i> will deliver thee.
    </li>
    <li>And a stone was brought, and <i>laued</i> upon the <i>screech</i> of the den; and the <i>dowriest homie</i> sealed it with <i>her</i> own signet, and with the signet of <i>her</i> <i>ladies</i>; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>trolled</i> to <i>her</i> <i>dowry lattie</i>, and passed the <i>nochy</i> <i>nistha manjarrying</i>: <i>nishta</i> were instruments of musick brought before <i>her</i>: and <i>her</i> <i>letty</i> <i>trolled</i> from <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>dowriest homie</i> arose <i>dowry</i> early in the morning, and <i>trolled</i> in haste unto the den of lions.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> to the den, <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> with a lamentable <i>cackling fakement</i> unto Daniel: and the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i> and <i>cackled</i> to Daniel, O Daniel, <i>serving homie</i> of the living <i>Gloria</i>, is thy <i>Gloria</i>, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> Daniel unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>, O <i>dowriest homie</i>, live for ever.
    </li>
    <li>My <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> <i>fairy</i>, and hath shut the lions&#8217; <i>screeches</i>, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before <i>her</i> innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O <i>dowriest homie</i>, have I done no hurt.
    </li>
    <li>Then was the <i>dowriest homie</i> exceedingly glad for <i>her</i>, and commanded that they should <i>lell</i> Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was <i>lelled</i> up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon <i>her</i>, because <i>she</i> believed in <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> commanded, and they brought those <i>homies</i> which had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their <i>chavvies</i>, and their <i>palone affairs</i>; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they <i>trolled</i> at the bottom of the den.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>dowriest homie</i> Darius <i>screeved</i> unto all <i>homies and palones</i>, nations, and languages, that <i>lett</i> in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.
    </li>
    <li>I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom <i>homies</i> tremble and fear before the <i>Gloria</i> of Daniel: for <i>she</i> is the living <i>Gloria</i>, and stedfast for ever, and <i>her</i> kingdom that which shall not be <i>battyfanged</i>, and <i>her</i> dominion shall be even unto the end.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> delivereth and rescueth, and <i>she</i> worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath <i>laued</i> Daniel from the power of the lions.
    </li>
    <li>So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>In the first year of Belshazzar <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> upon <i>her</i> bed: then <i>she</i> <i>screeved</i> the dream, and <i>cackled</i> the sum of the matters.
    </li>
    <li>Daniel <i>cackled</i> and <i>cackled</i>, I <i>vardad</i> in my vision by <i>nochy</i>, and, <i>varda</i>, the <i>quarter</i> winds of the heaven strove upon the <i>dowry</i> sea.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>quarter</i> <i>dowry</i> beasts <i>trolled</i> up from the sea, diverse <i>una</i> from another.
    </li>
    <li>The first was like a lion, and had eagle&#8217;s wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the <i>plates</i> as a <i>homie</i>, and a <i>homie</i>&#8216;s <i>thumping cheat</i> was <i>parkered</i> to it.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>varda</i> another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on <i>una</i> side, and it had <i>trey</i> ribs in the <i>screech</i> of it between the <i>hampsteads</i> of it: and they <i>cackled</i> thus unto it, Arise, devour <i>dowry</i> flesh.
    </li>
    <li>After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it <i>quarter</i> wings of a fowl; the beast had also <i>quarter</i> <i>ekes</i>; and dominion was <i>parkered</i> to it.
    </li>
    <li>After this I <i>vardad</i> in the <i>nochy</i> visions, and <i>varda</i> a <i>quarter</i> beast, dreadful and <i>nanna</i>, and <i>butch</i> exceedingly; and it had <i>dowry</i> iron <i>hampsteads</i>: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the <i>plates</i> of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had <i>dacha</i> <i>colins</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I considered the <i>colins</i>, and, <i>varda</i>, there <i>trolled</i> up among them another <i>bijou</i> <i>colin</i>, before whom there were <i>trey</i> of the first <i>colins</i> plucked up by the roots: and, <i>varda</i>, in this <i>colin</i> were <i>ogles</i> like the <i>ogles</i> of <i>homie</i>, and a <i>screech</i> speaking <i>dowry</i> <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did <i>lett</i>, whose <i>frock</i> was white as snow, and the <i>riah</i> of <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> like the pure wool: <i>her</i> throne was like the fiery flame, and <i>her</i> wheels as burning <i>binco fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>A fiery stream issued and <i>trolled</i> forth from before <i>her</i>: <i>mille</i> <i>milles</i> ministered unto <i>her</i>, and <i>dacha</i> <i>mille</i> times <i>dacha</i> <i>mille</i> stood before <i>her</i>: the judgment was set, and the <i>glossies</i> were opened.
    </li>
    <li>I beheld then because of the <i>cackling fakement</i> of the <i>dowry</i> <i>lavs</i> which the <i>colin</i> <i>cackled</i>: I beheld even till the beast was <i>ferricadoozed</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>lucoddy</i> <i>battyfanged</i>, and <i>parkered</i> to the burning flame.
    </li>
    <li>As concerning the <i>lettie</i> of the beasts, they had their dominion <i>lelled</i> away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.
    </li>
    <li>I <i>vardad</i> in the <i>nochy</i> visions, and, <i>varda</i>, <i>una</i> like the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i> <i>trolled</i> with the clouds of heaven, and <i>trolled</i> to the Ancient of days, and they brought <i>her</i> near before <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And there was <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> dominion, and <i>fabeness</i>, and a kingdom, that all <i>homies and palones</i>, nations, and languages, should serve <i>her</i>: <i>her</i> dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not <i>troll away</i>, and <i>her</i> kingdom that which shall not be <i>battyfanged</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I Daniel was grieved in my <i>Fairy</i> in the midst of my <i>lucoddy</i>, and the visions of my <i>eke</i> troubled me.
    </li>
    <li>I <i>trolled</i> near unto <i>una</i> of them that stood by, and asked <i>her</i> the truth of all this. So <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> me, and made me know the interpretation of the <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>These <i>dowry</i> beasts, which are <i>quarter</i>, are <i>quarter</i> <i>dowriest homies</i>, which shall arise out of the earth.
    </li>
    <li>But the saints of the most High shall <i>lell</i> the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.
    </li>
    <li>Then I would know the truth of the <i>quarter</i> beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose <i>hampsteads</i> were of iron, and <i>her</i> nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with <i>her</i> <i>plates</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And of the <i>dacha</i> <i>colins</i> that were in <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>, and of the other which <i>trolled</i> up, and before whom <i>trey</i> fell; even of that <i>colin</i> that had <i>ogles</i>, and a <i>screech</i> that <i>cackled</i> <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry</i> <i>fakements</i>, whose <i>varda</i> was more stout than <i>her</i> fellows.
    </li>
    <li>I beheld, and the same <i>colin</i> made <i>barney</i> with the saints, and prevailed against them;
    </li>
    <li>Until the Ancient of days <i>trolled</i>, and judgment was <i>parkered</i> to the saints of the most High; and the time <i>trolled</i> that the saints possessed the kingdom.
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, The <i>quarter</i> beast shall be the <i>quarter</i> kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall <i>mince</i> it down, and break it in pieces.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dacha</i> <i>colins</i> out of this kingdom are <i>dacha</i> <i>dowriest homies</i> that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and <i>she</i> shall be diverse from the first, and <i>she</i> shall subdue <i>trey</i> <i>dowriest homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> shall <i>cackle</i> <i>dowry</i> <i>lavs</i> against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be <i>parkered</i> into <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> until a time and times and the dividing of time.
    </li>
    <li>But the judgment shall <i>lett</i>, and they shall <i>lell</i> away <i>her</i> dominion, to consume and to <i>battyfang</i> it unto the end.
    </li>
    <li>And the kingdom and dominion, and the <i>dowriness</i> of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be <i>parkered</i> to the <i>homies and palones</i> of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations <i>dowry</i> troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my <i>thumping cheat</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>In the third year of the reign of <i>dowriest homie</i> Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>vardad</i> in a vision; <i>any road up</i>, when I <i>vardad</i>, that I was at Shushan in the <i>dowry lattie</i>, which is in the province of Elam; and I <i>vardad</i> in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.
    </li>
    <li>Then I lifted up mine <i>ogles</i>, and <i>vardad</i>, and, <i>varda</i>, there stood before the river a ram which had <i>dewey</i> <i>colins</i>: and the <i>dewey</i> <i>colins</i> were high; but <i>una</i> was higher than the other, and the higher <i>trolled</i> up last.
    </li>
    <li>I <i>vardad</i> the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before <i>her</i>, <i>nishta</i> was there any that could deliver out of <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>; but <i>she</i> did according to <i>her</i> will, and became <i>dowry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And as I was considering, <i>varda</i>, an <i>she</i> goat <i>trolled</i> from the west on the <i>eke</i> of the whole earth, and <i>reefed</i> not the ground: and the goat had a notable <i>colin</i> between <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> to the ram that had <i>dewey</i> <i>colins</i>, which I had <i>vardad</i> standing before the river, and ran unto <i>her</i> in the fury of <i>her</i> power.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i> <i>troll</i> close unto the ram, and <i>she</i> was <i>trolled</i> with choler against <i>her</i>, and <i>slapped</i> the ram, and brake <i>her</i> <i>dewey</i> <i>colins</i>: and there was no power in the ram to stand before <i>her</i>, but <i>she</i> cast <i>her</i> down to the ground, and stamped upon <i>her</i>: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore the <i>she</i> goat waxed <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry</i>: and when <i>she</i> was <i>butch</i>, the <i>dowry</i> <i>colin</i> was broken; and for it <i>trolled</i> up <i>quarter</i> notable ones toward the <i>quarter</i> winds of heaven.
    </li>
    <li>And out of <i>una</i> of them <i>trolled</i> forth a <i>bijou</i> <i>colin</i>, which waxed exceeding <i>dowry</i>, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the <i>dolly</i> land.
    </li>
    <li>And it waxed <i>dowry</i>, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the <i>twinkling fakements</i> to the ground, and stamped upon them.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, <i>she</i> magnified himself even to the <i>princess</i> of the host, and by <i>her</i> the daily <i>parker</i> was <i>lelled</i> away, and the place of the sanctuary was cast down.
    </li>
    <li>And an host was <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> against the daily <i>parker</i> by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.
    </li>
    <li>Then I <i>aunt nelled</i> <i>una</i> saint speaking, and another saint <i>cackled</i> unto that certain saint which <i>cackled</i>, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily <i>parker</i>, and the transgression of desolation, to <i>parker</i> both the sanctuary and the host to be <i>minced</i> under <i>plate</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, Unto <i>dewey</i> <i>mille</i> and <i>trey</i> <i>chenter</i> days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when I, even I Daniel, had <i>vardad</i> the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, <i>varda</i>, there stood before me as the appearance of a <i>homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>aunt nelled</i> a <i>homie</i>&#8216;s <i>cackling fakement</i> between the banks of Ulai, which <i>screeched</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Gabriel, make this <i>homie</i> to understand the vision.
    </li>
    <li>So <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> near where I stood: and when <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i>, I was afraid, and fell upon my <i>eke</i>: but <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, Understand, O <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>homie</i>: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.
    </li>
    <li>Now as <i>she</i> was speaking with me, I was in a deep <i>letty</i> on my <i>eke</i> toward the ground: but <i>she</i> <i>reefed</i> me, and set me upright.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be.
    </li>
    <li>The ram which thou sawest having <i>dewey</i> <i>colins</i> are the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Media and Persia.
    </li>
    <li>And the rough goat is the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Grecia: and the <i>dowry</i> <i>colin</i> that is between <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i> is the first <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now that being broken, whereas <i>quarter</i> stood up for it, <i>quarter</i> kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in <i>her</i> power.
    </li>
    <li>And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are <i>troll</i> to the full, a <i>dowriest homie</i> of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>her</i> power shall be <i>dowry butch</i>, but not by <i>her</i> own power: and <i>she</i> shall <i>battyfang</i> wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall <i>battyfang</i> the <i>dowry butch</i> and the <i>fabulosa</i> <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And through <i>her</i> policy also <i>she</i> shall cause craft to prosper in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>; and <i>she</i> shall magnify himself in <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>, and by peace shall <i>battyfang</i> many: <i>she</i> shall also stand up against the <i>princess</i> of <i>princesses</i>; but <i>she</i> shall be broken <i>nanti</i> <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the vision of the <i>bijou nochy</i> and the morning which was <i>cackled</i> is true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for many days.
    </li>
    <li>And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s business; and I was <i>gobsmacked</i> at the vision, but none understood it.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>In the first year of Darius the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ahasuerus, of the <i>maria</i> of the Medes, which was made <i>dowriest homie</i> over the realm of the Chaldeans;
    </li>
    <li>In the first year of <i>her</i> reign I Daniel understood by <i>glossies</i> the number of the years, whereof the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> to Jeremiah the prophet, that <i>she</i> would accomplish <i>setter dacha</i> years in the desolations of Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And I set my <i>eke</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>, to <i>charper</i> by <i>meshigener muttering</i> and supplications, with <i>nistha manjarrying</i>, and <i>nylon</i>, and ashes:
    </li>
    <li>And I prayed unto the <i>Duchess</i> my <i>Gloria</i>, and made my confession, and <i>cackled</i>, O <i>Duchess</i>, the <i>dowry</i> and dreadful <i>Gloria</i>, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love <i>her</i>, and to them that keep <i>her</i> <i>butch lavs</i>;
    </li>
    <li>We have <i>kertervered</i>, and have committed <i>codness</i>, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments:
    </li>
    <li><i>Nishta</i> have we <i>aunt nelled</i> unto thy <i>serving homies</i> the prophets, which <i>cackled</i> in thy name to our <i>dowriest homies</i>, our <i>princesses</i>, and our <i>aunties</i>, and to all the <i>homies and palones</i> of the land.
    </li>
    <li>O <i>Duchess</i>, <i>bonaness</i> belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of <i>ekes</i>, as at this <i>journo</i>; to the <i>homies</i> of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their <i>caterver</i> that they have trespassed against thee.
    </li>
    <li>O <i>Duchess</i>, to us belongeth confusion of <i>eke</i>, to our <i>dowriest homies</i>, to our <i>princesses</i>, and to our <i>aunties</i>, because we have <i>kertervered</i> against thee.
    </li>
    <li>To the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i> belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against <i>her</i>;
    </li>
    <li><i>Nishta</i> have we obeyed the <i>cackling fakement</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i>, to <i>mince</i> in <i>her</i> laws, which <i>she</i> set before us by <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i> the prophets.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy <i>cackling fakement</i>; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that is <i>screeved</i> in the law of <i>Maureen</i> the <i>serving homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, because we have <i>kertervered</i> against <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> hath confirmed <i>her</i> <i>lavs</i>, which <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> against us, and against our <i>beaks</i> that judged us, by bringing upon us a <i>dowry</i> <i>nana</i>: for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>As it is <i>screeved</i> in the law of <i>Maureen</i>, all this <i>nana</i> is <i>troll</i> upon us: yet made we not our <i>meshigener muttering</i> before the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i>, that we might turn from our <i>cods</i>, and understand thy truth.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore hath the <i>Duchess</i> watched upon the <i>nana</i>, and brought it upon us: for the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i> is <i>bona</i> in all <i>her</i> works which <i>she</i> doeth: for we obeyed not <i>her</i> <i>cackling fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And now, O <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i>, that hast brought thy <i>homies and palones</i> forth out of the land of Egypt with a <i>dowry butch</i> <i>famble</i>, and hast gotten thee renown, as at this <i>journo</i>; we have <i>kertervered</i>, we have done wickedly.
    </li>
    <li>O <i>Duchess</i>, according to all thy <i>bonaness</i>, I beseech thee, let thine <i>wild</i> and thy fury be turned away from thy <i>smoke</i> Jerusalem, thy <i>fabulosa</i> mountain: because for our <i>kertervers</i>, and for the <i>cods</i> of our <i>aunties</i>, Jerusalem and thy <i>homies and palones</i> are become a reproach to all that are about us.
    </li>
    <li>Now therefore, O our <i>Gloria</i>, <i>aunt nell</i> the <i>meshigener muttering</i> of thy <i>serving homie</i>, and <i>her</i> supplications, and cause thy <i>eke</i> to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s sake.
    </li>
    <li>O my <i>Gloria</i>, incline thine <i>aunt nelling cheat</i>, and <i>aunt nell</i>; open thine <i>ogles</i>, and <i>varda</i> our desolations, and the <i>smoke</i> which is <i>screeched</i> by thy name: for we <i>nix</i> present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy <i>dowry</i> mercies.
    </li>
    <li>O <i>Duchess</i>, <i>aunt nell</i>; O <i>Duchess</i>, forgive; O <i>Duchess</i>, <i>aunt nell</i> and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my <i>Gloria</i>: for thy <i>smoke</i> and thy <i>homies and palones</i> are <i>screeched</i> by thy name.
    </li>
    <li>And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my <i>kertever</i> and the <i>kertever</i> of my <i>homies and palones</i> Israel, and presenting my supplication before the <i>Duchess</i> my <i>Gloria</i> for the <i>fabulosa</i> mountain of my <i>Gloria</i>;
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, whiles I was speaking in <i>meshigener muttering</i>, even the <i>homie</i> Gabriel, whom I had <i>vardad</i> in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, <i>reefed</i> me about the time of the <i>bijou nochy</i> oblation.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> informed me, and talked with me, and <i>cackled</i>, O Daniel, I am now <i>troll</i> forth to <i>parker</i> thee skill and understanding.
    </li>
    <li>At the beginning of thy supplications the <i>butch lav</i> <i>trolled</i> forth, and I am <i>troll</i> to shew thee; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision.
    </li>
    <li><i>Setter dacha</i> weeks are determined upon thy <i>homies and palones</i> and upon thy <i>fabulosa</i> <i>smoke</i>, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of <i>kertervers</i>, and to make reconciliation for <i>codness</i>, and to <i>parker</i> in everlasting <i>bonaness</i>, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most <i>fabulosa</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the <i>butch lav</i> to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the <i>princess</i> shall be <i>setter</i> weeks, and <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> and <i>dewey</i> weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.
    </li>
    <li>And after <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> and <i>dewey</i> weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the <i>homies and palones</i> of the <i>princess</i> that shall <i>troll</i> shall <i>battyfang</i> the <i>smoke</i> and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a <i>dowry aqua</i>, and unto the end of the <i>barney</i> desolations are determined.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> shall confirm the covenant with many for <i>una</i> week: and in the midst of the week <i>she</i> shall cause the <i>parker</i> and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of <i>dowry cods</i> <i>she</i> shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.

    <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>In the third year of Cyrus <i>dowriest homie</i> of Persia a <i>fakement</i> was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was <i>screeched</i> Belteshazzar; and the <i>fakement</i> was true, but the time appointed was long: and <i>she</i> understood the <i>fakement</i>, and had understanding of the vision.
    </li>
    <li>In those days I Daniel was mourning <i>trey</i> full weeks.
    </li>
    <li>I ate no <i>dolly</i> <i>pannan</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>trolled</i> flesh <i>nishta</i> <i>sherry</i> in my <i>screech</i>, <i>nishta</i> did I anoint myself at all, till <i>trey</i> whole weeks were fulfilled.
    </li>
    <li>And in the <i>quarter</i> and <i>dewey dachath</i> <i>journo</i> of the first month, as I was by the side of the <i>dowry</i> river, which is Hiddekel;
    </li>
    <li>Then I lifted up mine <i>ogles</i>, and looked, and <i>varda</i> a certain <i>homie</i> clothed in <i>lycra</i>, whose loins were girded with <i>bona</i> <i>gelt</i> of Uphaz:
    </li>
    <li><i>Her</i> <i>lucoddy</i> also was like the beryl, and <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> as the appearance of lightning, and <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i> as <i>bincos</i> of <i>binco fakement</i>, and <i>her</i> arms and <i>her</i> <i>plates</i> like in colour to polished brass, and the <i>cackling fakement</i> of <i>her</i> <i>lavs</i> like the <i>cackling fakement</i> of a multitude.
    </li>
    <li>And I Daniel alone <i>vardad</i> the vision: for the <i>homies</i> that were with me <i>vardad</i> not the vision; but a <i>dowry</i> quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore I was <i>dry</i> alone, and <i>vardad</i> this <i>dowry</i> vision, and there remained no <i>butchness</i> in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no <i>butchness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Yet <i>aunt nelled</i> I the <i>cackling fakement</i> of <i>her</i> <i>lavs</i>: and when I <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>cackling fakement</i> of <i>her</i> <i>lavs</i>, then was I in a deep <i>letty</i> on my <i>eke</i>, and my <i>eke</i> toward the ground.
    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, an <i>famble</i> <i>reefed</i> me, which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my <i>fambles</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, O Daniel, a <i>homie</i> greatly beloved, understand the <i>lavs</i> that I <i>cackle</i> unto thee, and stand upright: for unto thee am I now <i>laued</i>. And when <i>she</i> had <i>cackled</i> this <i>lav</i> unto me, I stood trembling.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i> unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first <i>journo</i> that thou didst set thine <i>thumping cheat</i> to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy <i>Gloria</i>, thy <i>lavs</i> were <i>aunt nelled</i>, and I am <i>troll</i> for thy <i>lavs</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>princess</i> of the kingdom of Persia withstood me <i>una</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i> days: but, lo, Michael, <i>una</i> of the <i>dowriest</i> <i>princesses</i>, <i>trolled</i> to help me; and I remained there with the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Persia.
    </li>
    <li>Now I am <i>troll</i> to make thee understand what shall befall thy <i>homies and palones</i> in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> had <i>cackled</i> such <i>lavs</i> unto me, I set my <i>eke</i> toward the ground, and I became <i>nanti polari</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And, <i>varda</i>, <i>una</i> like the similitude of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of <i>homies</i> <i>reefed</i> my lips: then I opened my <i>screech</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> that stood before me, O my <i>Duchess</i>, by the vision my <i>shardas</i> are turned upon me, and I have retained no <i>butchness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For how can the <i>serving homie</i> of this my <i>Duchess</i> talk with this my <i>Duchess</i>? for as for me, straightway there remained no <i>butchness</i> in me, <i>nishta</i> is there breath <i>dry</i> in me.
    </li>
    <li>Then there <i>trolled</i> again and <i>reefed</i> me <i>una</i> like the appearance of a <i>homie</i>, and <i>she</i> strengthened me,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>cackled</i>, O <i>homie</i> greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee, be <i>butch</i>, <i>any road up</i>, be <i>butch</i>. And when <i>she</i> had <i>cackled</i> unto me, I was strengthened, and <i>cackled</i>, Let my <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackle</i>; for thou hast strengthened me.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i>, Knowest thou wherefore I <i>troll</i> unto thee? and now will I <i>troll back to</i> <i>palaver</i> with the <i>princess</i> of Persia: and when I am <i>trolled</i> forth, lo, the <i>princess</i> of Grecia shall <i>troll</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But I will shew thee that which is noted in the <i>glossy</i> of truth: and there is none that holdeth with me in these <i>fakements</i>, but Michael your <i>princess</i>.

    <h2>Chapter 11</h2>

    <li>Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to confirm and to strengthen <i>her</i>.

    <li>And now will I shew thee the truth. <i>Varda</i>, there shall stand up yet <i>trey</i> <i>dowriest homies</i> in Persia; and the <i>quarter</i> shall be far richer than they all: and by <i>her</i> <i>butchness</i> through <i>her</i> riches <i>she</i> shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia.

    <li>And a <i>dowry butch</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> shall stand up, that shall rule with <i>dowry</i> dominion, and do according to <i>her</i> will.

    <li>And when <i>she</i> shall stand up, <i>her</i> kingdom shall be broken, and shall be <i>medzered</i> toward the <i>quarter</i> winds of heaven; and not to <i>her</i> posterity, <i>nishta</i> according to <i>her</i> dominion which <i>she</i> ruled: for <i>her</i> kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of the south shall be <i>butch</i>, and <i>una</i> of <i>her</i> <i>princesses</i>; and <i>she</i> shall be <i>butch</i> above <i>her</i>, and have dominion; <i>her</i> dominion shall be a <i>dowry</i> dominion.
    </li>
    <li>And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>palone chavvie</i> of the south shall <i>troll</i> to the <i>dowriest homie</i> of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; <i>nishta</i> shall <i>she</i> stand, <i>nishta</i> <i>her</i> arm: but she shall be <i>parkered</i> up, and they that brought her, and <i>she</i> that <i>chavvied</i> her, and <i>she</i> that strengthened her in these times.
    </li>
    <li>But out of a branch of her roots shall <i>una</i> stand up in <i>her</i> estate, which shall <i>troll</i> with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail:
    </li>
    <li>And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their <i>princesses</i>, and with their precious <i>fakements</i> of silver and of <i>gelt</i>; and <i>she</i> shall continue more years than the <i>dowriest homie</i> of the north.
    </li>
    <li>So the <i>dowriest homie</i> of the south shall <i>troll</i> into <i>her</i> kingdom, and shall return into <i>her</i> own land.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of <i>dowry</i> forces: and <i>una</i> shall <i>mais oui</i> <i>troll</i>, and overflow, and pass through: then shall <i>she</i> return, and be stirred up, even to <i>her</i> fortress.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of the south shall be <i>trolled</i> with choler, and shall <i>troll</i> forth and <i>palaver</i> with <i>her</i>, even with the <i>dowriest homie</i> of the north: and <i>she</i> shall set forth a <i>dowry</i> multitude; but the multitude shall be <i>parkered</i> into <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> hath <i>lelled</i> away the multitude, <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> shall be lifted up; and <i>she</i> shall cast down many <i>dacha</i> <i>milles</i>: but <i>she</i> shall not be strengthened by it.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>dowriest homie</i> of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude <i>dowrier</i> than the former, and shall <i>mais oui</i> <i>troll</i> after certain years with a <i>dowry</i> army and with <i>dowry</i> riches.
    </li>
    <li>And in those times there shall many stand up against the <i>dowriest homie</i> of the south: also the robbers of thy <i>homies and palones</i> shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall.
    </li>
    <li>So the <i>dowriest homie</i> of the north shall <i>troll</i>, and cast up a mount, and <i>lell</i> the most fenced <i>smokes</i>: and the arms of the south shall not withstand, <i>nishta</i> <i>her</i> chosen <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>nishta</i> shall there be any <i>butchness</i> to withstand.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> that <i>trolleth</i> against <i>her</i> shall do according to <i>her</i> own will, and none shall stand before <i>her</i>: and <i>she</i> shall stand in the <i>fabe</i> land, which by <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> shall be consumed.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> shall also set <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> to enter with the <i>butchness</i> of <i>her</i> whole kingdom, and upright ones with <i>her</i>; thus shall <i>she</i> do: and <i>she</i> shall <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> the <i>palone chavvie</i> of <i>palones</i>, corrupting her: but she shall not stand on <i>her</i> side, <i>nishta</i> be for <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>After this shall <i>she</i> turn <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> unto the isles, and shall <i>lell</i> many: but a <i>princess</i> for <i>her</i> own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by <i>her</i> to cease; <i>nanti</i> <i>her</i> own reproach <i>she</i> shall cause it to turn upon <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>she</i> shall turn <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> toward the fort of <i>her</i> own land: but <i>she</i> shall stumble and fall, and not be found.
    </li>
    <li>Then shall stand up in <i>her</i> estate a raiser of taxes in the <i>fabeness</i> of the kingdom: but within <i>nishta dowry</i> days <i>she</i> shall be <i>battyfanged</i>, <i>nishta</i> in <i>wild</i>, <i>nishta</i> in battle.
    </li>
    <li>And in <i>her</i> estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not <i>parker</i> the honour of the kingdom: but <i>she</i> shall <i>troll</i> in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.
    </li>
    <li>And with the arms of a <i>dowry aqua</i> shall they be overflown from before <i>her</i>, and shall be broken; <i>any road up</i>, also the <i>princess</i> of the covenant.
    </li>
    <li>And after the league made with <i>her</i> <i>she</i> shall <i>acting dickey</i> deceitfully: for <i>she</i> shall <i>troll</i> up, and shall become <i>butch</i> with a <i>pogey</i> <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province; and <i>she</i> shall do that which <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i> have not done, <i>nishta</i> <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>&#8216; <i>aunties</i>; <i>she</i> shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and riches: <i>any road up</i>, and <i>she</i> shall forecast <i>her</i> devices against the <i>butch</i> holds, even for a time.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> shall stir up <i>her</i> power and <i>her</i> courage against the <i>dowriest homie</i> of the south with a <i>dowry</i> army; and the <i>dowriest homie</i> of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry</i> and <i>dowry butch</i> army; but <i>she</i> shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, they that feed of the portion of <i>her</i> <i>carnish</i> shall <i>battyfang</i> <i>her</i>, and <i>her</i> army shall overflow: and many shall fall down <i>ferricadoozed</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And both of these <i>dowriest homies</i>&#8216; <i>thumping cheats</i> shall be to do mischief, and they shall <i>cackle</i> lies at <i>una</i> table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.
    </li>
    <li>Then shall <i>she</i> return into <i>her</i> land with <i>dowry</i> riches; and <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> shall be against the <i>fabulosa</i> covenant; and <i>she</i> shall do exploits, and <i>troll back to</i> <i>her</i> own land.
    </li>
    <li>At the time appointed <i>she</i> shall return, and <i>troll</i> toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>latties on water</i> of Chittim shall <i>troll</i> against <i>her</i>: therefore <i>she</i> shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the <i>fabulosa</i> covenant: so shall <i>she</i> do; <i>she</i> shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the <i>fabulosa</i> covenant.
    </li>
    <li>And arms shall stand on <i>her</i> part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of <i>butchness</i>, and shall <i>lell</i> away the daily <i>parker</i>, and they shall place the <i>dowry cod</i> that maketh desolate.
    </li>
    <li>And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall <i>she</i> corrupt by flatteries: but the <i>homies and palones</i> that do know their <i>Gloria</i> shall be <i>butch</i>, and do exploits.
    </li>
    <li>And they that understand among the <i>homies and palones</i> shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the <i>dowry efink</i>, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, many days.
    </li>
    <li>Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a <i>bijou</i> help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.
    </li>
    <li>And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time appointed.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> shall do according to <i>her</i> will; and <i>she</i> shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every <i>Gloria</i>, and shall <i>cackle</i> marvellous <i>fakements</i> against the <i>Gloria</i> of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done.
    </li>
    <li><i>Nishta</i> shall <i>she</i> regard the <i>Gloria</i> of <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>, <i>nishta</i> the <i>fancy</i> of <i>palones</i>, <i>nishta</i> regard any <i>Gloria</i>: for <i>she</i> shall magnify himself above all.
    </li>
    <li>But in <i>her</i> estate shall <i>she</i> honour the <i>Gloria</i> of forces: and a <i>Gloria</i> whom <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i> knew not shall <i>she</i> honour with <i>gelt</i>, and silver, and with precious stones, and <i>dolly</i> <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thus shall <i>she</i> do in the most <i>butch</i> holds with a strange <i>Gloria</i>, whom <i>she</i> shall acknowledge and increase with <i>fabeness</i>: and <i>she</i> shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain.
    </li>
    <li>And at the time of the end shall the <i>dowriest homie</i> of the south push at <i>her</i>: and the <i>dowriest homie</i> of the north shall <i>troll</i> against <i>her</i> like a whirlwind, with <i>rattling coves</i>, and with horsemen, and with many <i>latties on water</i>; and <i>she</i> shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and <i>troll over</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> shall enter also into the <i>fabe</i> land, and many countries shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>, even Edom, and Moab, and the <i>dowriest</i> of the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> shall stretch forth <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> also upon the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> shall have power over the <i>gelt</i> of <i>gelt</i> and of silver, and over all the precious <i>fakements</i> of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at <i>her</i> steps.
    </li>
    <li>But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble <i>her</i>: therefore <i>she</i> shall <i>troll forth</i> with <i>dowry</i> fury to <i>battyfang</i>, and utterly to make away many.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> shall plant the <i>bijoux tabernaclettes</i> of <i>her</i> <i>dowry lattie</i> between the seas in the <i>fabe</i> <i>fabulosa</i> mountain; yet <i>she</i> shall <i>troll</i> to <i>her</i> end, and none shall help <i>her</i>.
    </li>

    <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And at that time shall Michael stand up, the <i>dowry</i> <i>princess</i> which standeth for the <i>chavvies</i> of thy <i>homies and palones</i>: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy <i>homies and palones</i> shall be <i>laued</i>, every <i>una</i> that shall be found <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And many of them that <i>letty</i> in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to <i>scharda</i> and everlasting contempt.
    </li>
    <li>And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to <i>bonaness</i> as the <i>twinkling fakements</i> for ever and ever.
    </li>
    <li>But thou, O Daniel, shut up the <i>lavs</i>, and seal the <i>glossy</i>, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.
    </li>
    <li>Then I Daniel looked, and, <i>varda</i>, there stood other <i>dewey</i>, the <i>una</i> on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>una</i> <i>cackled</i> to the <i>homie</i> clothed in <i>lycra</i>, which was upon the <i>aquas</i> of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>homie</i> clothed in <i>lycra</i>, which was upon the <i>aquas</i> of the river, when <i>she</i> held up <i>her</i> <i>sweet martini</i> and <i>her</i> <i>dry martini</i> unto heaven, and sware by <i>her</i> that <i>letteth</i> for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when <i>she</i> shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the <i>fabulosa</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, all these <i>fakements</i> shall be finished.
    </li>
    <li>And I <i>aunt nelled</i>, but I understood not: then <i>cackled</i> I, O my <i>Duchess</i>, what shall be the end of these <i>fakements</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>troll</i> thy way, Daniel: for the <i>lavs</i> are closed up and sealed till the time of the end.
    </li>
    <li>Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the <i>naff</i> shall do wickedly: and none of the <i>naff</i> shall understand; but the wise shall understand.
    </li>
    <li>And from the time that the daily <i>parker</i> shall be <i>lelled</i> away, and the <i>dowry cod</i> that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a <i>mille</i> <i>dewey</i> <i>chenter</i> and <i>nobber dacha</i> days.
    </li>
    <li><i>Fabed</i> is <i>she</i> that waiteth, and <i>trolleth</i> to the <i>mille</i> <i>trey</i> <i>chenter</i> and <i>chinker</i> and <i>trey dacha</i> days.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>troll</i> thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt <i>lettie</i>, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days.
