    <h1>2 Kings</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the <i>carking it</i> of Ahab.
    </li>
    <li>And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in <i>her</i> upper <i>booth</i> that was in Samaria, and was sick: and <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> messengers, and <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>troll</i>, enquire of Baalzebub the <i>Gloria</i> of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, <i>troll</i> up to meet the messengers of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Samaria, and <i>cackle</i> unto them, Is it not because there is not a <i>Gloria</i> in Israel, that ye <i>troll</i> to enquire of Baalzebub the <i>Gloria</i> of Ekron?
    </li>
    <li>Now therefore thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>troll</i> down from that bed on which thou art <i>trolled</i> up, but shalt surely <i>cark it</i>. And Elijah <i>trolled off</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when the messengers turned back unto <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Why are ye now turned back?
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, There <i>trolled</i> a <i>homie</i> up to meet us, and <i>cackled</i> unto us, <i>troll</i>, turn again unto the <i>dowriest homie</i> that <i>laued</i> you, and <i>cackle</i> unto <i>her</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, Is it not because there is not a <i>Gloria</i> in Israel, that thou sendest to enquire of Baalzebub the <i>Gloria</i> of Ekron? therefore <i>nishta</i> <i>troll</i> down from that bed on which thou art <i>trolled</i> up, but shalt surely <i>cark it</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, What manner of <i>homie</i> was <i>she</i> which <i>trolled</i> up to meet you, and <i>cackled</i> you these <i>lavs</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And they answered <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> was an hairy <i>homie</i>, and girt with a girdle of leather about <i>her</i> loins. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, It is Elijah the Tishbite.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>laued</i> unto <i>her</i> a captain of <i>chinker dacha</i> with <i>her</i> <i>chinker dacha</i>. And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> up to <i>her</i>: and, <i>varda</i>, <i>she</i> sat on the top of an hill. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Thou <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, the <i>dowriest homie</i> hath <i>cackled</i>, <i>troll</i> down.
    </li>
    <li>And Elijah answered and <i>cackled</i> to the captain of <i>chinker dacha</i>, If I be a <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, then let <i>binco fakement</i> <i>troll</i> down from heaven, and consume thee and thy <i>chinker dacha</i>. And there <i>trolled</i> down <i>binco fakement</i> from heaven, and consumed <i>her</i> and <i>her</i> <i>chinker dacha</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Again also <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> unto <i>her</i> another captain of <i>chinker dacha</i> with <i>her</i> <i>chinker dacha</i>. And <i>she</i> answered and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, O <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, thus hath the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>troll</i> down quickly.
    </li>
    <li>And Elijah answered and <i>cackled</i> unto them, If I be a <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, let <i>binco fakement</i> <i>troll</i> down from heaven, and consume thee and thy <i>chinker dacha</i>. And the <i>binco fakement</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>trolled</i> down from heaven, and consumed <i>her</i> and <i>her</i> <i>chinker dacha</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> again a captain of the third <i>chinker dacha</i> with <i>her</i> <i>chinker dacha</i>. And the third captain of <i>chinker dacha</i> <i>trolled</i> up, and <i>trolled</i> and fell on <i>her</i> knees before Elijah, and besought <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, O <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these <i>chinker dacha</i> thy <i>serving homies</i>, be precious in thy <i>vardaing</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, there <i>trolled</i> <i>binco fakement</i> down from heaven, and burnt up the <i>dewey</i> captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy <i>vardaing</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Elijah, <i>troll</i> down with <i>her</i>: be not afraid of <i>her</i>. And <i>she</i> arose, and <i>trolled</i> down with <i>her</i> unto the <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, Forasmuch as thou hast <i>laued</i> messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the <i>Gloria</i> of Ekron, is it not because there is no <i>Gloria</i> in Israel to enquire of <i>her</i> <i>lav</i>? therefore <i>nishta</i> <i>troll</i> down off that bed on which thou art <i>trolled</i> up, but shalt surely <i>cark it</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So <i>she</i> <i>carked it</i> according to the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> which Elijah had <i>cackled</i>. And Jehoram reigned in <i>her</i> stead in the second year of Jehoram the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jehoshaphat <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah; because <i>she</i> had no <i>homie chavvie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now the <i>lettie</i> of the acts of Ahaziah which <i>she</i> did, are they not <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the chronicles of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Israel?
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when the <i>Duchess</i> would <i>lell</i> up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah <i>trolled</i> with Elisha from Gilgal.
    </li>
    <li>And Elijah <i>cackled</i> unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>laued</i> me to Bethel. And Elisha <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, As the <i>Duchess</i> <i>letteth</i>, and as thy <i>nishta lucoddy</i> <i>letteth</i>, I will not leave thee. So they <i>trolled</i> down to Bethel.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>homie chavvies</i> of the prophets that were at Bethel <i>trolled</i> forth to Elisha, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Knowest thou that the <i>Duchess</i> will <i>lell</i> away thy master from thy <i>eke</i> to <i>journo</i>? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>any road up</i>, I know it; hold ye your peace.
    </li>
    <li>And Elijah <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>laued</i> me to Jericho. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, As the <i>Duchess</i> <i>letteth</i>, and as thy <i>nishta lucoddy</i> <i>letteth</i>, I will not leave thee. So they <i>trolled</i> to Jericho.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>homie chavvies</i> of the prophets that were at Jericho <i>trolled</i> to Elisha, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Knowest thou that the <i>Duchess</i> will <i>lell</i> away thy master from thy <i>eke</i> to <i>journo</i>? And <i>she</i> answered, <i>any road up</i>, I know it; hold ye your peace.
    </li>
    <li>And Elijah <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>laued</i> me to Jordan. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, As the <i>Duchess</i> <i>letteth</i>, and as thy <i>nishta lucoddy</i> <i>letteth</i>, I will not leave thee. And they <i>dewey</i> <i>trolled</i> on.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>chinker dacha</i> <i>homies</i> of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of the prophets <i>trolled</i>, and stood to view <i>nishta ajax</i> off: and they <i>dewey</i> stood by Jordan.
    </li>
    <li>And Elijah <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> mantle, and wrapped it together, and <i>slapped</i> the <i>aquas</i>, and they were <i>medzered</i> hither and thither, so that they <i>dewey</i> <i>trolled</i> over on dry ground.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when they were <i>trolled</i> over, that Elijah <i>cackled</i> unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be <i>lelled</i> away from thee. And Elisha <i>cackled</i>, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy <i>Fairy</i> be upon me.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Thou hast asked a hard <i>fakement</i>: <i>any road up</i>, if thou <i>varda</i> me when I am <i>lelled</i> from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, as they still <i>trolled</i> on, and talked, that, <i>varda</i>, there appeared a <i>trundling cheat</i> of <i>binco fakement</i>, and horses of <i>binco fakement</i>, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah <i>trolled</i> up by a whirlwind into heaven.
    </li>
    <li>And Elisha <i>vardad</i> it, and <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i>, My <i>Auntie</i>, my <i>Auntie</i>, the <i>trundling cheat</i> of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i> <i>nishta</i>: and <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> hold of <i>her</i> own <i>zhoosh</i>, and rent them in <i>dewey</i> pieces.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> <i>lelled</i> up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from <i>her</i>, and <i>trolled</i> back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> the mantle of Elijah that fell from <i>her</i>, and <i>slapped</i> the <i>aquas</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Where is the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Elijah? and when <i>she</i> also had smitten the <i>aquas</i>, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha <i>trolled</i> over.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>homie chavvies</i> of the prophets which were to view at Jericho <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i>, they <i>cackled</i>, The <i>Fairy</i> of Elijah doth <i>lettie</i> on Elisha. And they <i>trolled</i> to meet <i>her</i>, and bowed themselves to the ground before <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>varda</i> now, there be with thy <i>serving homies</i> <i>chinker dacha</i> <i>manly alices</i>; let them <i>troll</i>, we pray thee, and <i>charper</i> thy master: lest peradventure the <i>Fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> up, and cast <i>her</i> upon some mountain, or into some valley. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>nanti</i> <i>lau</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when they urged <i>her</i> till <i>she</i> was ashamed, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>lau</i>. They <i>laued</i> therefore <i>chinker dacha</i> <i>homies</i>; and they sought <i>trey</i> days, but found <i>her</i> not.
    </li>
    <li>And when they <i>trolled</i> again to <i>her</i>, (for <i>she</i> tarried at Jericho,) <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Did I not <i>cackle</i> unto you, <i>troll not</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>homies</i> of the <i>smoke</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Elisha, <i>varda</i>, I pray thee, the situation of this <i>smoke</i> is <i>dolly</i>, as my <i>Duchess</i> <i>vardaeth</i>: but the <i>aqua</i> is naught, and the ground barren.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>parker</i> me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> forth unto the spring of the <i>aquas</i>, and cast the salt in there, and <i>cackled</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, I have healed these <i>aquas</i>; there shall not be from thence any more <i>carking it</i> or barren land.
    </li>
    <li>So the <i>aquas</i> were healed unto this <i>journo</i>, according to the <i>cackling</i> of Elisha which <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> up from thence unto Bethel: and as <i>she</i> was going up by the way, there <i>trolled</i> forth <i>bijou</i> <i>chavvies</i> out of the <i>smoke</i>, and mocked <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>troll</i> up, thou bald <i>eke</i>; <i>troll</i> up, thou bald <i>eke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the <i>Duchess</i>. And there <i>trolled</i> forth <i>dewey</i> she bears out of the wood, and tare <i>quarter dacha</i> and <i>dewey</i> <i>chavvies</i> of them.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence <i>she</i> <i>trolled back to</i> Samaria.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now Jehoram the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, and reigned <i>kenza</i> years.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> wrought <i>nana</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>; but not like <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, and like <i>her</i> mother: for <i>she</i> put away the image of Baal that <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> had made.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> <i>she</i> cleaved unto the <i>kertervers</i> of Jeroboam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nebat, which made Israel to <i>kertever</i>; <i>she</i> <i>trolled off</i> not therefrom.
    </li>
    <li>And Mesha <i>dowriest homie</i> of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel an <i>chenter</i> <i>mille</i> lambs, and an <i>chenter</i> <i>mille</i> rams, with the wool.
    </li>
    <li>But it <i>trolled</i> to pass, when Ahab was <i>stiff</i>, that the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Moab rebelled against the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>dowriest homie</i> Jehoram <i>trolled</i> out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> and <i>laued</i> to Jehoshaphat the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, <i>cackling</i>, The <i>dowriest homie</i> of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou <i>troll</i> with me against Moab to battle? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, I will <i>troll</i> up: I am as thou art, my <i>homies and palones</i> as thy <i>homies and palones</i>, and my horses as thy horses.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Which way shall we <i>troll</i> up? And <i>she</i> answered, The way through the <i>nishta smoke</i> of Edom.
    </li>
    <li>So the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel <i>trolled</i>, and the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, and the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Edom: and they fetched a compass of <i>setter</i> days&#8217; journey: and there was no <i>aqua</i> for the host, and for the cattle that <i>trolled after</i> them.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel <i>cackled</i>, Alas! that the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>screeched</i> these <i>trey</i> <i>dowriest homies</i> together, to deliver them into the <i>famble</i> of Moab!
    </li>
    <li>But Jehoshaphat <i>cackled</i>, Is there not here a prophet of the <i>Duchess</i>, that we may enquire of the <i>Duchess</i> by <i>her</i>? And <i>una</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel&#8217;s <i>serving homies</i> answered and <i>cackled</i>, Here is Elisha the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Shaphat, which poured <i>aqua</i> on the <i>fambles</i> of Elijah.
    </li>
    <li>And Jehoshaphat <i>cackled</i>, The <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> is with <i>her</i>. So the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Edom <i>trolled</i> down to <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Elisha <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy <i>Auntie</i>, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Nay: for the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>screeched</i> these <i>trey</i> <i>dowriest homies</i> together, to deliver them into the <i>famble</i> of Moab.
    </li>
    <li>And Elisha <i>cackled</i>, As the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts <i>letteth</i>, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, I would not <i>varda</i> toward thee, <i>nishta</i> <i>varda</i> thee.
    </li>
    <li>But now <i>parker</i> me a <i>joggering homie</i>. <i>Any road up</i>, when the <i>joggering homie</i> played, that the <i>famble</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> upon <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, Make this valley full of ditches.
    </li>
    <li>For thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>nanti</i> <i>varda</i> wind, <i>nishta</i> shall ye <i>varda</i> rain; yet that valley shall be filled with <i>aqua</i>, that ye may <i>buvare</i>, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.
    </li>
    <li>And this is but a <i>sparkle</i> <i>fakement</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>: <i>she</i> will deliver the Moabites also into your <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And ye shall <i>slap</i> every fenced <i>smoke</i>, and every choice <i>smoke</i>, and shall fell every <i>bona</i> tree, and stop all wells of <i>aqua</i>, and mar every <i>bona</i> piece of land with stones.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> in the morning, when the <i>carnish</i> <i>parkering</i> was offered, that, <i>varda</i>, there <i>trolled</i> <i>aqua</i> by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with <i>aqua</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when all the Moabites <i>aunt nelled</i> that the <i>dowriest homies</i> were <i>troll</i> up to <i>palaver</i> against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood in the border.
    </li>
    <li>And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the <i>aqua</i>, and the Moabites <i>vardad</i> the <i>aqua</i> on the other side as red as blood:
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>cackled</i>, This is blood: the <i>dowriest homies</i> are surely <i>ferricadoozed</i>, and they have smitten <i>una</i> another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.
    </li>
    <li>And when they <i>trolled</i> to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and <i>slapped</i> the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they <i>trolled</i> forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>zsa zsa-ed</i> down the <i>smokes</i>, and on every <i>bona</i> piece of land cast every <i>homie</i> <i>her</i> stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of <i>aqua</i>, and felled all the <i>bona</i> trees: only in Kirharaseth <i>dry</i> they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers <i>trolled</i> about it, and <i>slapped</i> it.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Moab <i>vardad</i> that the battle was too sore for <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> with <i>her</i> <i>setter</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>homies</i> that drew <i>dowry efinks</i>, to break through even unto the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Edom: but they could not.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> eldest <i>homie chavvie</i> that should have reigned in <i>her</i> stead, and offered <i>her</i> for a burnt <i>parkering</i> upon the wall. And there was <i>dowry</i> indignation against Israel: and they <i>trolled off</i> from <i>her</i>, and <i>trolled back to</i> their own land.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now there <i>screeched</i> a certain <i>palone</i> of the <i>palone affairs</i> of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of the prophets unto Elisha, <i>cackling</i>, Thy <i>serving homie</i> my <i>homie affair</i> is <i>stiff</i>; and thou knowest that thy <i>serving homie</i> did fear the <i>Duchess</i>: and the creditor is <i>troll</i> to <i>lell</i> unto <i>her</i> my <i>dewey</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> to be bondmen.
    </li>
    <li>And Elisha <i>cackled</i> unto her, What shall I do for thee? <i>cackle</i> me, what hast thou in the <i>lattie</i>? And she <i>cackled</i>, Thine <i>famble palone</i> hath not any <i>fakement</i> in the <i>lattie</i>, save a pot of <i>lube</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>troll</i>, borrow thee <i>fakements</i> abroad of all thy neighbours, even empty <i>fakements</i>; borrow not a <i>nishta dowry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when thou art <i>troll</i> in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy <i>homie chavvies</i>, and shalt pour out into all those <i>fakements</i>, and thou shalt set aside that which is full.
    </li>
    <li>So she <i>trolled</i> from <i>her</i>, and shut the door upon her and upon her <i>homie chavvies</i>, who brought the <i>fakements</i> to her; and she poured out.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when the <i>fakements</i> were full, that she <i>cackled</i> unto her <i>homie chavvie</i>, <i>parker</i> me yet a <i>fakement</i>. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto her, There is not a <i>fakement</i> more. And the <i>lube</i> stayed.
    </li>
    <li>Then she <i>trolled</i> and <i>cackled</i> the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>troll</i>, sell the <i>lube</i>, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy <i>chavvies</i> of the <i>lettie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And it fell on a <i>journo</i>, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a <i>dowry</i> <i>palone</i>; and she constrained <i>her</i> to <i>jarry</i> <i>pannan</i>. And so it was, that as oft as <i>she</i> <i>trolled by</i>, <i>she</i> turned in thither to <i>jarry</i> <i>pannan</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And she <i>cackled</i> unto her <i>homie affair</i>, <i>varda</i> now, I perceive that this is an <i>fabulosa</i> <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, which passeth by us continually.
    </li>
    <li>Let us make a <i>bijou</i> <i>booth</i>, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set for <i>her</i> there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when <i>she</i> <i>trolleth</i> to us, that <i>she</i> shall turn in thither.
    </li>
    <li>And it fell on a <i>journo</i>, that <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> thither, and <i>she</i> turned into the <i>booth</i>, and <i>lett</i> there.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> to Gehazi <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i>, <i>screech</i> this Shunammite. And when <i>she</i> had <i>screeched</i> her, she stood before <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>cackle</i> now unto her, <i>varda</i>, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldest thou be <i>cackled</i> for to the <i>dowriest homie</i>, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I <i>lett</i> among mine own <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no <i>chavvie</i>, and her <i>homie affair</i> is <i>badge</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>screech</i> her. And when <i>she</i> had <i>screeched</i> her, she stood in the door.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a <i>homie chavvie</i>. And she <i>cackled</i>, Nay, my <i>Duchess</i>, thou <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, <i>nix</i> lie unto thine <i>famble palone</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>palone</i> conceived, and bare a <i>homie chavvie</i> at that season that Elisha had <i>cackled</i> unto her, according to the time of life.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>chavvie</i> was grown, it fell on a <i>journo</i>, that <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> out to <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> to the reapers.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, My <i>eke</i>, my <i>eke</i>. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> to a <i>bean cove</i>, Carry <i>her</i> to <i>her</i> mother.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> had <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i>, and brought <i>her</i> to <i>her</i> mother, <i>she</i> sat on her knees till noon, and then <i>carked it</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And she <i>trolled</i> up, and <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> on the bed of the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and shut the door upon <i>her</i>, and <i>trolled</i> out.
    </li>
    <li>And she <i>screeched</i> unto her <i>homie affair</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>lau</i> me, I pray thee, <i>una</i> of the <i>bean coves</i>, and <i>una</i> of the asses, that I may run to the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and <i>troll</i> again.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Wherefore wilt thou <i>troll</i> to <i>her</i> to <i>journo</i>? it is <i>nishta</i> new moon, <i>nishta</i> sabbath. And she <i>cackled</i>, It shall be well.
    </li>
    <li>Then she saddled an ass, and <i>cackled</i> to her <i>serving homie</i>, Drive, and <i>troll</i> forward; slack not thy riding for me, except I bid thee.
    </li>
    <li>So she <i>trolled</i> and <i>trolled</i> unto the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> to mount Carmel. <i>Any road up</i>, when the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>vardad</i> her <i>nishta ajax</i> off, that <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> to Gehazi <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i>, <i>varda</i>, yonder is that Shunammite:
    </li>
    <li>Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and <i>cackle</i> unto her, Is it well with thee? is it well with thy <i>homie affair</i>? is it well with the <i>chavvie</i>? And she answered, It is well:
    </li>
    <li>And when she <i>trolled</i> to the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> to the hill, she caught <i>her</i> by the <i>plates</i>: but Gehazi <i>trolled</i> near to thrust her away. And the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i>, Let her alone; for her <i>nishta lucoddy</i> is vexed within her: and the <i>Duchess</i> hath hid it from me, and hath not <i>cackled</i> me.
    </li>
    <li>Then she <i>cackled</i>, Did I <i>fancy</i> a <i>homie chavvie</i> of my <i>Duchess</i>? did I not <i>cackle</i>, <i>nix</i> <i>mogue</i> me?
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and <i>lell</i> my <i>trolling fakement</i> in thine <i>famble</i>, and <i>troll</i> thy way: if thou meet any <i>homie</i>, salute <i>her</i> not; and if any salute thee, answer <i>her</i> not again: and <i>lett</i> my <i>trolling fakement</i> upon the <i>eke</i> of the <i>chavvie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the mother of the <i>chavvie</i> <i>cackled</i>, As the <i>Duchess</i> <i>letteth</i>, and as thy <i>nishta lucoddy</i> <i>letteth</i>, I will not leave thee. And <i>she</i> arose, and <i>trolled after</i> her.
    </li>
    <li>And Gehazi passed on before them, and <i>laued</i> the <i>trolling fakement</i> upon the <i>eke</i> of the <i>chavvie</i>; but there was <i>nishta</i> <i>cackling fakement</i>, <i>nishta</i> hearing. Wherefore <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> again to meet <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i> <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, The <i>chavvie</i> is not awaked.
    </li>
    <li>And when Elisha was <i>troll</i> into the <i>lattie</i>, <i>varda</i>, the <i>chavvie</i> was <i>stiff</i>, and <i>laued</i> upon <i>her</i> bed.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> <i>trolled</i> in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> up, and <i>lett</i> upon the <i>chavvie</i>, and put <i>her</i> <i>screech</i> upon <i>her</i> <i>screech</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i> upon <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i> upon <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i>: and stretched himself upon the <i>chavvie</i>; and the flesh of the <i>chavvie</i> waxed warm.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>she</i> <i>trolled back</i>, and <i>minced</i> in the <i>lattie</i> to and fro; and <i>trolled</i> up, and stretched himself upon <i>her</i>: and the <i>chavvie</i> sneezed <i>setter</i> times, and the <i>chavvie</i> opened <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> Gehazi, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>screech</i> this Shunammite. So <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> her. And when she was <i>troll</i> in unto <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>lell</i> up thy <i>homie chavvie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then she <i>trolled</i> in, and fell at <i>her</i> <i>plates</i>, and bowed herself to the ground, and <i>lelled</i> up her <i>homie chavvie</i>, and <i>trolled</i> out.
    </li>
    <li>And Elisha <i>trolled</i> again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the land; and the <i>homie chavvies</i> of the prophets were sitting before <i>her</i>: and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i>, Set on the <i>dowry</i> pot, and seethe pottage for the <i>homie chavvies</i> of the prophets.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>una</i> <i>trolled</i> out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds <i>her</i> lap full, and <i>trolled</i> and shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not.
    </li>
    <li>So they poured out for the <i>homies</i> to <i>jarry</i>. <i>Any road up</i>, as they were eating of the pottage, that they <i>screeched</i> out, and <i>cackled</i>, O thou <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, there is <i>carking it</i> in the pot. And they could not <i>jarry</i> thereof.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Then <i>parker</i> meal. And <i>she</i> cast it into the pot; and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Pour out for the <i>homies and palones</i>, that they may <i>jarry</i>. And there was no harm in the pot.
    </li>
    <li>And there <i>trolled</i> a <i>homie</i> from Baalshalisha, and brought the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>pannan</i> of the firstfruits, <i>dewey dacha</i> loaves of barley, and full <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> of corn in the husk thereof. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>parker</i> unto the <i>homies and palones</i>, that they may <i>jarry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>her</i> servitor <i>cackled</i>, What, should I set this before an <i>chenter</i> <i>homies</i>? <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> again, <i>parker</i> the <i>homies and palones</i>, that they may <i>jarry</i>: for thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, They shall <i>jarry</i>, and shall leave thereof.
    </li>
    <li>So <i>she</i> set it before them, and they did <i>jarry</i>, and <i>dry</i> thereof, according to the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.

    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now Naaman, captain of the host of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Syria, was a <i>dowry</i> <i>homie</i> with <i>her</i> master, and honourable, because by <i>her</i> the <i>Duchess</i> had <i>parkered</i> deliverance unto Syria: <i>she</i> was also a <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homie</i> in valour, but <i>she</i> was a leper.
    </li>
    <li>And the Syrians had <i>trolled</i> out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a <i>bijou</i> maid; and she waited on Naaman&#8217;s <i>palone affair</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And she <i>cackled</i> unto her mistress, Would <i>Gloria</i> my <i>Duchess</i> were with the prophet that is in Samaria! for <i>she</i> would recover <i>her</i> of <i>her</i> leprosy.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>una</i> <i>trolled</i> in, and <i>cackled</i> <i>her</i> <i>Duchess</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Thus and thus <i>cackled</i> the maid that is of the land of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Syria <i>cackled</i>, <i>troll</i> to, <i>troll</i>, and I will <i>lau</i> a letter unto the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel. And <i>she</i> <i>trolled off</i>, and <i>lelled</i> with <i>her</i> <i>dacha</i> talents of silver, and <i>sey</i> <i>mille</i> pieces of <i>gelt</i>, and <i>dacha</i> changes of <i>clobber</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> brought the letter to the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel, <i>cackling</i>, Now when this letter is <i>troll</i> unto thee, <i>varda</i>, I have therewith <i>laued</i> Naaman my <i>serving homie</i> to thee, that thou mayest recover <i>her</i> of <i>her</i> leprosy.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel had <i>varda the lavs</i> the letter, that <i>she</i> rent <i>her</i> <i>zhoosh</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Am I <i>Gloria</i>, to <i>ferricadoza</i> and to make alive, that this <i>homie</i> doth <i>lau</i> unto me to recover a <i>homie</i> of <i>her</i> leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and <i>varda</i> how <i>she</i> <i>charpereth</i> a quarrel against me.
    </li>
    <li>And it was so, when Elisha the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> had <i>aunt nelled</i> that the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel had rent <i>her</i> <i>zhoosh</i>, that <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> to the <i>dowriest homie</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Wherefore hast thou rent thy <i>zhoosh</i>? let <i>her</i> <i>troll</i> now to me, and <i>she</i> shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.
    </li>
    <li>So Naaman <i>trolled</i> with <i>her</i> horses and with <i>her</i> <i>trundling cheat</i>, and stood at the door of the <i>lattie</i> of Elisha.
    </li>
    <li>And Elisha <i>laued</i> a messenger unto <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>troll</i> and <i>dhobie</i> in Jordan <i>setter</i> times, and thy flesh shall <i>troll</i> again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.
    </li>
    <li>But Naaman was <i>dander</i>, and <i>trolled</i> away, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, I thought, <i>she</i> will surely <i>troll</i> out to me, and stand, and <i>screech</i> on the name of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i>, and strike <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> over the place, and recover the leper.
    </li>
    <li>Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, <i>benar</i> than all the <i>aquas</i> of Israel? may I not <i>dhobie</i> in them, and be clean? So <i>she</i> turned and <i>trolled</i> away in a rage.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i> <i>trolled</i> near, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, My <i>Auntie</i>, if the prophet had bid thee do some <i>dowry</i> <i>fakement</i>, wouldest thou not have done it? how <i>dowry</i> rather then, when <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i> to thee, <i>dhobie</i>, and be clean?
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>trolled</i> <i>she</i> down, and dipped himself <i>setter</i> times in Jordan, according to the <i>cackling</i> of the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>: and <i>her</i> flesh <i>trolled</i> again like unto the flesh of a <i>bijou</i> <i>chavvie</i>, and <i>she</i> was clean.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled back to</i> the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, <i>she</i> and all <i>her</i> company, and <i>trolled</i>, and stood before <i>her</i>: and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, now I know that there is no <i>Gloria</i> in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, <i>lell</i> a <i>bona lav</i> of thy <i>serving homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, As the <i>Duchess</i> <i>letteth</i>, before whom I stand, I will <i>lall</i> none. And <i>she</i> urged <i>her</i> to <i>lell</i> it; but <i>she</i> refused.
    </li>
    <li>And Naaman <i>cackled</i>, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be <i>parkered</i> to thy <i>serving homie</i> <i>dewey</i> mules&#8217; burden of earth? for thy <i>serving homie</i> will henceforth offer <i>nishta</i> burnt <i>parkering</i> <i>nishta</i> <i>parker</i> unto other gods, but unto the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>In this <i>fakement</i> the <i>Duchess</i> pardon thy <i>serving homie</i>, that when my master goeth into the <i>lattie</i> of Rimmon to worship there, and <i>she</i> leaneth on my <i>famble</i>, and I bow myself in the <i>lattie</i> of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the <i>lattie</i> of Rimmon, the <i>Duchess</i> pardon thy <i>serving homie</i> in this <i>fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>sling yer hook</i>. So <i>she</i> <i>trolled off</i> from <i>her</i> a <i>bijou</i> way.
    </li>
    <li>But Gehazi, the <i>serving homie</i> of Elisha the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i> that which <i>she</i> brought: but, as the <i>Duchess</i> <i>letteth</i>, I will run after <i>her</i>, and <i>lell</i> somewhat of <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So Gehazi <i>trolled after</i> after Naaman. And when Naaman <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i> <i>trolling</i> after <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> lighted down from the <i>trundling cheat</i> to meet <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Is all well?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, All is well. My master hath <i>laued</i> me, <i>cackling</i>, <i>varda</i>, even now there be <i>troll</i> to me from mount Ephraim <i>dewey</i> <i>bean coves</i> of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of the prophets: <i>parker</i> them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and <i>dewey</i> changes of <i>frocks</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Naaman <i>cackled</i>, Be content, <i>lell</i> <i>dewey</i> talents. And <i>she</i> urged <i>her</i>, and bound <i>dewey</i> talents of silver in <i>dewey</i> bags, with <i>dewey</i> changes of <i>frocks</i>, and <i>laued</i> them upon <i>dewey</i> of <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>; and they bare them before <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> to the tower, <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> them from their <i>famble</i>, and bestowed them in the <i>lattie</i>: and <i>she</i> let the <i>homies</i> <i>troll</i>, and they <i>trolled off</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> in, and stood before <i>her</i> master. And Elisha <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Thy <i>serving homie</i> <i>trolled</i> no whither.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>trolled</i> not mine <i>thumping cheat</i> with thee, when the <i>homie</i> turned again from <i>her</i> <i>trundling cheat</i> to meet thee? Is it a time to <i>lall</i> <i>dinarly</i>, and to <i>lall</i> <i>frocks</i>, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and <i>homieservants</i>, and <i>palone servants</i>?
    </li>
    <li>The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy <i>maria</i> for ever. And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> out from <i>her</i> presence a leper as white as snow.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And the <i>homie chavvies</i> of the prophets <i>cackled</i> unto Elisha, <i>varda</i> now, the place where we <i>lett</i> with thee is too <i>hettie</i> for us.
    </li>
    <li>Let us <i>troll</i>, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and <i>lell</i> thence every <i>homie</i> a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may <i>lett</i>. And <i>she</i> answered, <i>troll</i> ye.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>una</i> <i>cackled</i>, Be content, I pray thee, and <i>troll</i> with thy <i>serving homies</i>. And <i>she</i> answered, I will <i>troll</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> with them. And when they <i>trolled</i> to Jordan, they cut down wood.
    </li>
    <li>But as <i>una</i> was felling a beam, the axe <i>eke</i> fell into the <i>aqua</i>: and <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Alas, master! for it was borrowed.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i>, Where fell it? And <i>she</i> shewed <i>her</i> the place. And <i>she</i> cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and the iron did swim.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i>, <i>lell</i> it up to thee. And <i>she</i> put out <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>, and <i>lelled</i> it.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Syria warred against Israel, and <i>lelled</i> counsel with <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>, <i>cackling</i>, In such and such a place shall be my camp.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>laued</i> unto the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel, <i>cackling</i>, <i>gardy loo</i> that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are <i>troll</i> down.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel <i>laued</i> to the place which the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i> <i>her</i> and warned <i>her</i> of, and saved himself there, not once <i>nishta</i> twice.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore the <i>thumping cheat</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Syria was sore troubled for this <i>fakement</i>; and <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto them, Will ye not shew me which of us is for the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>una</i> of <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i> <i>cackled</i>, None, my <i>Duchess</i>, O <i>dowriest homie</i>: but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel the <i>lavs</i> that thou <i>cacklest</i> in thy <i>pallias</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>troll</i> and spy where <i>she</i> is, that I may <i>lau</i> and fetch <i>her</i>. And it was <i>cackled</i> <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>varda</i>, <i>she</i> is in Dothan.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore <i>laued</i> <i>she</i> thither horses, and <i>rattling coves</i>, and a <i>dowry</i> host: and they <i>trolled</i> by <i>nochy</i>, and compassed the <i>smoke</i> about.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>serving homie</i> of the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> was risen early, and <i>trolled</i> forth, <i>varda</i>, an host compassed the <i>smoke</i> both with horses and <i>rattling coves</i>. And <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Alas, my master! how shall we do?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.
    </li>
    <li>And Elisha prayed, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, I pray thee, open <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i>, that <i>she</i> may <i>varda</i>. And the <i>Duchess</i> opened the <i>ogles</i> of the <i>bean cove</i>; and <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i>: and, <i>varda</i>, the mountain was full of horses and <i>rattling coves</i> of <i>binco fakement</i> round about Elisha.
    </li>
    <li>And when they <i>trolled</i> down to <i>her</i>, Elisha prayed unto the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>slap</i> this <i>homies and palones</i>, I pray thee, with blindness. And <i>she</i> <i>slapped</i> them with blindness according to the <i>lav</i> of Elisha.
    </li>
    <li>And Elisha <i>cackled</i> unto them, This is not the way, <i>nishta</i> is this the <i>smoke</i>: <i>troll after</i> me, and I will <i>parker</i> you to the <i>homie</i> whom ye <i>charper</i>. But <i>she</i> led them to Samaria.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when they were <i>troll</i> into Samaria, that Elisha <i>cackled</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, open the <i>ogles</i> of these <i>homies</i>, that they may <i>varda</i>. And the <i>Duchess</i> opened their <i>ogles</i>, and they <i>vardad</i>; and, <i>varda</i>, they were in the midst of Samaria.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel <i>cackled</i> unto Elisha, when <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> them, My <i>Auntie</i>, shall I <i>slap</i> them? shall I <i>slap</i> them?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> answered, <i>nishta</i> <i>slap</i> them: wouldest thou <i>slap</i> those whom thou hast <i>lelled</i> captive with thy <i>dowry efink</i> and with thy bow? set <i>pannan</i> and <i>aqua</i> before them, that they may <i>jarry</i> and <i>buvare</i>, and <i>troll</i> to their master.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> prepared <i>dowry</i> provision for them: and when they had <i>jarried</i> and <i>bevvied</i>, <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> them away, and they <i>trolled</i> to their master. So the bands of Syria <i>trolled</i> <i>nishta</i> into the land of Israel.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> after this, that Benhadad <i>dowriest homie</i> of Syria gathered all <i>her</i> host, and <i>trolled</i> up, and besieged Samaria.
    </li>
    <li>And there was a <i>dowry</i> <i>nix munjarlee</i> in Samaria: and, <i>varda</i>, they besieged it, until an ass&#8217;s <i>eke</i> was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the <i>quarter</i> part of a cab of dove&#8217;s dung for <i>chinker</i> pieces of silver.
    </li>
    <li>And as the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there <i>screeched</i> a <i>palone</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Help, my <i>Duchess</i>, O <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, If the <i>Duchess</i> <i>nix</i> help thee, whence shall I help thee? out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress?
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This <i>palone</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me, <i>parker</i> thy <i>homie chavvie</i>, that we may <i>jarry</i> <i>her</i> to <i>journo</i>, and we will <i>jarry</i> my <i>homie chavvie</i> to morrow.
    </li>
    <li>So we boiled my <i>homie chavvie</i>, and did <i>jarry</i> <i>her</i>: and I <i>cackled</i> unto her on the next <i>journo</i>, <i>parker</i> thy <i>homie chavvie</i>, that we may <i>jarry</i> <i>her</i>: and she hath hid her <i>homie chavvie</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>lavs</i> of the <i>palone</i>, that <i>she</i> rent <i>her</i> <i>zhoosh</i>; and <i>she</i> <i>trolled by</i> upon the wall, and the <i>homies and palones</i> looked, and, <i>varda</i>, <i>she</i> had <i>nylon</i> within upon <i>her</i> flesh.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>Gloria</i> do so and more also to me, if the <i>eke</i> of Elisha the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Shaphat shall stand on <i>her</i> this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But Elisha sat in <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>, and the <i>fungi</i> sat with <i>her</i>; and the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>laued</i> a <i>homie</i> from before <i>her</i>: but ere the messenger <i>trolled</i> to <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> to the <i>fungi</i>, <i>varda</i> ye how this <i>homie chavvie</i> of a murderer hath <i>laued</i> to <i>lell</i> away mine <i>eke</i>? <i>varda</i>, when the messenger <i>trolleth</i>, shut the door, and hold <i>her</i> <i>nishta manjarry</i> at the door: is not the sound of <i>her</i> master&#8217;s <i>plates</i> behind <i>her</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And while <i>she</i> yet talked with them, <i>varda</i>, the messenger <i>trolled</i> down unto <i>her</i>: and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, this <i>nana</i> is of the <i>Duchess</i>; what should I wait for the <i>Duchess</i> any longer?
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Then Elisha <i>cackled</i>, <i>aunt nell</i> ye the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>; Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, To morrow about this time shall a measure of <i>bona</i> flour be sold for a <i>medzer</i>, and <i>dewey</i> measures of barley for a <i>medzer</i>, in the gate of Samaria.
    </li>
    <li>Then a <i>Duchess</i> on whose <i>famble</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> leaned answered the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, if the <i>Duchess</i> would make windows in heaven, might this <i>fakement</i> be? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, thou shalt <i>varda</i> it with thine <i>ogles</i>, but shalt not <i>jarry</i> thereof.
    </li>
    <li>And there were <i>quarter</i> leprous <i>homies</i> at the entering in of the gate: and they <i>cackled</i> <i>una</i> to another, Why <i>lett</i> we here until we <i>cark it</i>?
    </li>
    <li>If we <i>cackle</i>, We will enter into the <i>smoke</i>, then the <i>nix munjarlee</i> is in the <i>smoke</i>, and we shall <i>cark it</i> there: and if we <i>lett</i> still here, we <i>cark it</i> also. Now therefore <i>troll</i>, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they <i>ferricadoza</i> us, we shall but <i>cark it</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they rose up in the twilight, to <i>troll</i> unto the camp of the Syrians: and when they were <i>troll</i> to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, <i>varda</i>, there was no <i>homie</i> there.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>Duchess</i> had made the host of the Syrians to <i>aunt nell</i> a <i>screech</i> of <i>rattling coves</i>, and a <i>screech</i> of horses, even the <i>screech</i> of a <i>dowry</i> host: and they <i>cackled</i> <i>una</i> to another, Lo, the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel hath hired against us the <i>dowriest homies</i> of the Hittites, and the <i>dowriest homies</i> of the Egyptians, to <i>troll</i> upon us.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and <i>dry</i> their <i>trolling letties</i>, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.
    </li>
    <li>And when these lepers <i>trolled</i> to the uttermost part of the camp, they <i>trolled</i> into <i>una</i> <i>trolling lettie</i>, and did <i>jarry</i> and <i>buvare</i>, and <i>lelled</i> thence silver, and <i>gelt</i>, and <i>clobber</i>, and <i>trolled</i> and hid it; and <i>trolled</i> again, and entered into another <i>trolling lettie</i>, and <i>lelled</i> thence also, and <i>trolled</i> and hid it.
    </li>
    <li>Then they <i>cackled</i> <i>una</i> to another, We <i>nix</i> well: this <i>journo</i> is a <i>journo</i> of <i>bona</i> tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning <i>sparkle</i>, some mischief will <i>troll</i> upon us: now therefore <i>troll</i>, that we may <i>troll</i> and <i>cackle</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s household.
    </li>
    <li>So they <i>trolled</i> and <i>screeched</i> unto the porter of the <i>smoke</i>: and they <i>cackled</i> them, <i>cackling</i>, We <i>trolled</i> to the camp of the Syrians, and, <i>varda</i>, there was no <i>homie</i> there, <i>nishta</i> <i>cackling fakement</i> of <i>homie</i>, but horses tied, and asses tied, and the <i>trolling letties</i> as they were.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> the porters; and they <i>cackled</i> it to the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i> within.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> arose in the <i>nochy</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>, I will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we be hungry; therefore are they <i>trolled</i> out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, <i>cackling</i>, When they <i>troll</i> out of the <i>smoke</i>, we shall catch them alive, and get into the <i>smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>una</i> of <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i> answered and <i>cackled</i>, Let some <i>lell</i>, I pray thee, <i>chinker</i> of the horses that remain, which are <i>dry</i> in the <i>smoke</i>, (<i>varda</i>, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are <i>dry</i> in it: <i>varda</i>, I <i>cackle</i>, they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us <i>lau</i> and <i>varda</i>.
    </li>
    <li>They <i>lelled</i> therefore <i>dewey</i> <i>trundling cheat</i> horses; and the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>laued</i> after the host of the Syrians, <i>cackling</i>, <i>troll</i> and <i>varda</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>trolled</i> after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way was full of <i>frocks</i> and <i>fakements</i>, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And the messengers <i>trolled back</i>, and <i>cackled</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>trolled</i> out, and spoiled the <i>trolling letties</i> of the Syrians. So a measure of <i>bona</i> flour was sold for a <i>medzer</i>, and <i>dewey</i> measures of barley for a <i>medzer</i>, according to the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> appointed the <i>Duchess</i> on whose <i>famble</i> <i>she</i> leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the <i>homies and palones</i> trode upon <i>her</i> in the gate, and <i>she</i> <i>carked it</i>, as the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> had <i>cackled</i>, who <i>cackled</i> when the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>trolled</i> down to <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> as the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> had <i>cackled</i> to the <i>dowriest homie</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>dewey</i> measures of barley for a <i>medzer</i>, and a measure of <i>bona</i> flour for a <i>medzer</i>, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria:
    </li>
    <li>And that <i>Duchess</i> answered the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Now, <i>varda</i>, if the <i>Duchess</i> should make windows in heaven, might such a <i>fakement</i> be? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, thou shalt <i>varda</i> it with thine <i>ogles</i>, but shalt not <i>jarry</i> thereof.
    </li>
    <li>And so it fell out unto <i>her</i>: for the <i>homies and palones</i> trode upon <i>her</i> in the gate, and <i>she</i> <i>carked it</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> Elisha unto the <i>palone</i>, whose <i>homie chavvie</i> <i>she</i> had restored to life, <i>cackling</i>, Arise, and <i>troll</i> thou and thine household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>screeched</i> for a <i>nix munjarlee</i>; and it shall also <i>troll</i> upon the land <i>setter</i> years.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>palone</i> arose, and did after the <i>cackling</i> of the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>: and she <i>trolled</i> with her household, and sojourned in the land of the <i>naffs</i> <i>setter</i> years.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> at the <i>setter</i> years&#8217; end, that the <i>palone</i> <i>trolled back</i> out of the land of the <i>naffs</i>: and she <i>trolled</i> forth to <i>screech</i> unto the <i>dowriest homie</i> for her <i>lattie</i> and for her land.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> talked with Gehazi the <i>serving homie</i> of the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>cackle</i> me, I pray thee, all the <i>dowry</i> <i>fakements</i> that Elisha hath done.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, as <i>she</i> was telling the <i>dowriest homie</i> how <i>she</i> had restored a <i>stiff</i> <i>lucoddy</i> to life, that, <i>varda</i>, the <i>palone</i>, whose <i>homie chavvie</i> <i>she</i> had restored to life, <i>screeched</i> to the <i>dowriest homie</i> for her <i>lattie</i> and for her land. And Gehazi <i>cackled</i>, My <i>Duchess</i>, O <i>dowriest homie</i>, this is the <i>palone</i>, and this is her <i>homie chavvie</i>, whom Elisha restored to life.
    </li>
    <li>And when the <i>dowriest homie</i> asked the <i>palone</i>, she <i>cackled</i> <i>her</i>. So the <i>dowriest homie</i> appointed unto her a certain officer, <i>cackling</i>, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the <i>journo</i> that she <i>dry</i> the land, even until now.
    </li>
    <li>And Elisha <i>trolled</i> to Damascus; and Benhadad the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Syria was sick; and it was <i>cackled</i> <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, The <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> is <i>troll</i> hither.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Hazael, <i>lell</i> a present in thine <i>famble</i>, and <i>troll</i>, meet the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and enquire of the <i>Duchess</i> by <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Shall I recover of this disease?
    </li>
    <li>So Hazael <i>trolled</i> to meet <i>her</i>, and <i>lelled</i> a present with <i>her</i>, even of every <i>bona</i> <i>fakement</i> of Damascus, <i>quarter dacha</i> camels&#8217; burden, and <i>trolled</i> and stood before <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Thy <i>homie chavvie</i> Benhadad <i>dowriest homie</i> of Syria hath <i>laued</i> me to thee, <i>cackling</i>, Shall I recover of this disease?
    </li>
    <li>And Elisha <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>troll</i>, <i>cackle</i> unto <i>her</i>, Thou mayest <i>mais oui</i> recover: howbeit the <i>Duchess</i> hath shewed me that <i>she</i> shall surely <i>cark it</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> settled <i>her</i> countenance stedfastly, until <i>she</i> was ashamed: and the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>parnied</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Hazael <i>cackled</i>, Why weepeth my <i>Duchess</i>? And <i>she</i> answered, Because I know the <i>nana</i> that thou wilt do unto the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel: their <i>butch</i> holds wilt thou set on <i>binco fakement</i>, and their <i>bean coves</i> wilt thou <i>ferricadooza</i> with the <i>dowry efink</i>, and wilt dash their <i>chavvies</i>, and rip up their <i>palones</i> <i>up the duff</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Hazael <i>cackled</i>, But what, is thy <i>serving homie</i> a dog, that <i>she</i> should do this <i>dowry</i> <i>fakement</i>? And Elisha answered, The <i>Duchess</i> hath shewed me that thou shalt be <i>dowriest homie</i> over Syria.
    </li>
    <li>So <i>she</i> <i>trolled off</i> from Elisha, and <i>trolled</i> to <i>her</i> master; who <i>cackled</i> to <i>her</i>, What <i>cackled</i> Elisha to thee? And <i>she</i> answered, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> me that thou shouldest surely recover.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> on the morrow, that <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> a thick cloth, and dipped it in <i>aqua</i>, and spread it on <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>, so that <i>she</i> <i>carked it</i>: and Hazael reigned in <i>her</i> stead.
    </li>
    <li>And in the fifth year of Joram the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ahab <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, Jehoram the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Je hoshaphat <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah began to reign.
    </li>
    <li><i>Trey dacha</i> and <i>dewey</i> years <i>badge</i> was <i>she</i> when <i>she</i> began to reign; and <i>she</i> reigned <i>say dooe</i> years in Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>minced</i> in the way of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Israel, as did the <i>lattie</i> of Ahab: for the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Ahab was <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>: and <i>she</i> did <i>nana</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Yet the <i>Duchess</i> would not <i>battyfang</i> Judah for <i>Davina</i> <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i>&#8216;s sake, as <i>she</i> promised <i>her</i> to <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> alway a <i>sparkle</i>, and to <i>her</i> <i>chavvies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>In <i>her</i> days Edom revolted from under the <i>famble</i> of Judah, and made a <i>dowriest homie</i> over themselves.
    </li>
    <li>So Joram <i>trolled</i> over to Zair, and all the <i>rattling coves</i> with <i>her</i>: and <i>she</i> rose by <i>nochy</i>, and <i>slapped</i> the Edomites which compassed <i>her</i> about, and the captains of the <i>rattling coves</i>: and the <i>homies and palones</i> fled into their <i>trolling letties</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Yet Edom revolted from under the <i>famble</i> of Judah unto this <i>journo</i>. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>lettie</i> of the acts of Joram, and all that <i>she</i> did, are they not <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the chronicles of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Judah?
    </li>
    <li>And Joram <i>lettied</i> with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>, and was buried with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i> in the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i>: and Ahaziah <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> reigned in <i>her</i> stead.
    </li>
    <li>In the twelfth year of Joram the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ahab <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel did Ahaziah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jehoram <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah begin to reign.
    </li>
    <li><i>Dewey</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i> years <i>badge</i> was Ahaziah when <i>she</i> began to reign; and <i>she</i> reigned <i>una</i> year in Jerusalem. And <i>her</i> mother&#8217;s name was Athaliah, the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Omri <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>minced</i> in the way of the <i>lattie</i> of Ahab, and did <i>nana</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, as did the <i>lattie</i> of Ahab: for <i>she</i> was the <i>homie chavvie</i> in law of the <i>lattie</i> of Ahab.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> with Joram the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ahab to the <i>barney</i> against Hazael <i>dowriest homie</i> of Syria in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>dowriest homie</i> Joram <i>trolled</i> back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> at Ramah, when <i>she</i> <i>palavered</i> against Hazael <i>dowriest homie</i> of Syria. And Ahaziah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jehoram <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah <i>trolled</i> down to <i>varda</i> Joram the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ahab in Jezreel, because <i>she</i> was sick.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And Elisha the prophet <i>screeched</i> <i>una</i> of the <i>chavvies</i> of the prophets, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Gird up thy loins, and <i>lell</i> this box of <i>lube</i> in thine <i>famble</i>, and <i>troll</i> to Ramothgilead:
    </li>
    <li>And when thou comest thither, <i>varda</i> out there Jehu the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jehoshaphat the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nimshi, and <i>troll</i> in, and make <i>her</i> arise up from among <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, and carry <i>her</i> to an <i>back slum</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>lell</i> the box of <i>lube</i>, and pour it on <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>, and <i>cackle</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, I have anointed thee <i>dowriest homie</i> over Israel. Then open the door, and <i>scarper</i>, and tarry not.
    </li>
    <li>So the <i>bean cove</i>, even the <i>bean cove</i> the prophet, <i>trolled</i> to Ramothgilead.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i>, <i>varda</i>, the captains of the host were sitting; and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu <i>cackled</i>, Unto which of all us? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, To thee, O captain.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> arose, and <i>trolled</i> into the <i>lattie</i>; and <i>she</i> poured the <i>lube</i> on <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, I have anointed thee <i>dowriest homie</i> over the <i>homies and palones</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, even over Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And thou shalt <i>slap</i> the <i>lattie</i> of Ahab thy master, that I may <i>do the rights</i> the blood of my <i>serving homies</i> the prophets, and the blood of all the <i>serving homies</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, at the <i>famble</i> of Jezebel.
    </li>
    <li>For the whole <i>lattie</i> of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from Ahab <i>her</i> that pisseth against the wall, and <i>her</i> that is shut up and <i>dry</i> in Israel:
    </li>
    <li>And I will make the <i>lattie</i> of Ahab like the <i>lattie</i> of Jeroboam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nebat, and like the <i>lattie</i> of Baasha the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ahijah:
    </li>
    <li>And the dogs shall <i>jarry</i> Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her. And <i>she</i> opened the door, and fled.
    </li>
    <li>Then Jehu <i>trolled</i> forth to the <i>serving homies</i> of <i>her</i> <i>Duchess</i>: and <i>una</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Is all well? wherefore <i>trolled</i> this mad fellow to thee? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Ye know the <i>homie</i>, and <i>her</i> communication.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>cackled</i>, It is false; <i>cackle</i> us now. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Thus and thus <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i> to me, <i>cackling</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, I have anointed thee <i>dowriest homie</i> over Israel.
    </li>
    <li>Then they hasted, and <i>lelled</i> every <i>homie</i> <i>her</i> <i>frock</i>, and put it under <i>her</i> on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, <i>cackling</i>, Jehu is <i>dowriest homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So Jehu the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jehoshaphat the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead, <i>she</i> and all Israel, because of Hazael <i>dowriest homie</i> of Syria.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>dowriest homie</i> Joram was <i>trolled back to</i> be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i>, when <i>she</i> <i>palavered</i> with Hazael <i>dowriest homie</i> of Syria. ) And Jehu <i>cackled</i>, If it be your minds, then let none <i>troll forth</i> <i>nishta</i> escape out of the <i>smoke</i> to <i>troll</i> to <i>cackle</i> it in Jezreel.
    </li>
    <li>So Jehu rode in a <i>trundling cheat</i>, and <i>trolled</i> to Jezreel; for Joram <i>lett</i> there. And Ahaziah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah was <i>troll</i> down to <i>varda</i> Joram.
    </li>
    <li>And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> the company of Jehu as <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, I <i>varda</i> a company. And Joram <i>cackled</i>, <i>lell</i> an horseman, and <i>lau</i> to meet them, and let <i>her</i> <i>cackle</i>, Is it peace?
    </li>
    <li>So there <i>trolled</i> <i>una</i> on horseback to meet <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>, Is it peace? And Jehu <i>cackled</i>, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman <i>cackled</i>, <i>cackling</i>, The messenger <i>trolled</i> to them, but <i>she</i> <i>trolleth</i> not again.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> out a second on horseback, which <i>trolled</i> to them, and <i>cackled</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.
    </li>
    <li>And the watchman <i>cackled</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> even unto them, and <i>trolleth</i> not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nimshi; for <i>she</i> driveth furiously.
    </li>
    <li>And Joram <i>cackled</i>, Make ready. And <i>her</i> <i>trundling cheat</i> was made ready. And Joram <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel and Ahaziah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah <i>trolled</i> out, each in <i>her</i> <i>trundling cheat</i>, and they <i>trolled</i> out against Jehu, and met <i>her</i> in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when Joram <i>vardad</i> Jehu, that <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Is it peace, Jehu? And <i>she</i> answered, What peace, so long as the <i>bitainedoms</i> of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?
    </li>
    <li>And Joram turned <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i>, and fled, and <i>cackled</i> to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah.
    </li>
    <li>And Jehu drew a bow with <i>her</i> full <i>butchness</i>, and <i>slapped</i> Jehoram between <i>her</i> arms, and the arrow <i>trolled</i> out at <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>, and <i>she</i> sunk down in <i>her</i> <i>trundling cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> Jehu to Bidkar <i>her</i> captain, <i>lell</i> up, and cast <i>her</i> in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, the <i>Duchess</i> <i>laued</i> this burden upon <i>her</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Surely I have <i>vardad</i> yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>; and I will requite thee in this plat, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>. Now therefore <i>lell</i> and cast <i>her</i> into the plat of ground, according to the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But when Ahaziah the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah <i>vardad</i> this, <i>she</i> fled by the way of the garden <i>lattie</i>. And Jehu <i>trolled after</i> after <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>slap</i> <i>her</i> also in the <i>trundling cheat</i>. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam. And <i>she</i> fled to Megiddo, and <i>carked it</i> there.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i> <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> in a <i>trundling cheat</i> to Jerusalem, and buried <i>her</i> in <i>her</i> sepulchre with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i> in the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And in the eleventh year of Joram the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.
    </li>
    <li>And when Jehu was <i>troll</i> to Jezreel, Jezebel <i>aunt nelled</i> of it; and she <i>slapped up</i> her <i>eke</i>, and tired her <i>eke</i>, and looked out at a window.
    </li>
    <li>And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she <i>cackled</i>, Had Zimri peace, who <i>ferricadoozaed</i> <i>her</i> master?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> lifted up <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> to the window, and <i>cackled</i>, Who is on my side? who? And there looked out to <i>her</i> <i>dewey</i> or <i>trey</i> eunuchs.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and <i>she</i> trode her under <i>plate</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> was <i>troll</i> in, <i>she</i> did <i>jarry</i> and <i>buvare</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>troll</i>, <i>varda</i> now this cursed <i>palone</i>, and bury her: for she is a <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>palone chavvie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>trolled</i> to bury her: but they found <i>nishta</i> of her than the skull, and the <i>plates</i>, and the palms of her <i>fambles</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore they <i>trolled</i> again, and <i>cackled</i> <i>her</i>. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, This is the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, which <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> by <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i> Elijah the Tishbite, <i>cackling</i>, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs <i>jarry</i> the flesh of Jezebel:
    </li>
    <li>And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the <i>eke</i> of the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not <i>cackle</i>, This is Jezebel.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>And Ahab had <i>setter dacha</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> in Samaria. And Jehu <i>screeved</i> letters, and <i>laued</i> to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the <i>fungi</i>, and to them that brought up Ahab&#8217;s <i>chavvies</i>, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Now as soon as this letter <i>trolleth</i> to you, <i>vardaing</i> your master&#8217;s <i>homie chavvies</i> are with you, and there are with you <i>rattling coves</i> and horses, a fenced <i>smoke</i> also, and armour;

    </li>
    <li>But they were exceedingly afraid, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, <i>dewey</i> <i>dowriest homies</i> stood not before <i>her</i>: how then shall we stand?

    <li>And <i>she</i> that was over the <i>lattie</i>, and <i>she</i> that was over the <i>smoke</i>, the <i>fungi</i> also, and the bringers up of the <i>chavvies</i>, <i>laued</i> to Jehu, <i>cackling</i>, We are thy <i>serving homies</i>, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any <i>dowriest homie</i>: do thou that which is <i>bona</i> in thine <i>ogles</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>she</i> <i>screeved</i> a letter the second time to them, <i>cackling</i>, If ye be mine, and if ye will <i>aunt nell</i> unto my <i>cackling fakement</i>, <i>lell</i> ye the <i>ekes</i> of the <i>homies</i> your master&#8217;s <i>homie chavvies</i>, and <i>troll</i> to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time. Now the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>homie chavvies</i>, being <i>setter dacha</i> persons, were with the <i>dowry</i> <i>homies</i> of the <i>smoke</i>, which brought them up.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when the letter <i>trolled</i> to them, that they <i>lelled</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>homie chavvies</i>, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> <i>setter dacha</i> persons, and put their <i>ekes</i> in baskets, and <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> them to Jezreel.
    </li>
    <li>And there <i>trolled</i> a messenger, and <i>cackled</i> <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, They have brought the <i>ekes</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>homie chavvies</i>. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>lett</i> ye them in <i>dewey</i> heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> in the morning, that <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> out, and stood, and <i>cackled</i> to all the <i>homies and palones</i>, Ye be <i>bona</i>: <i>varda</i>, I conspired against my master, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> <i>her</i>: but who <i>ferricadoozaed</i> all these?
    </li>
    <li>Know now that there shall fall unto the earth <i>nishter</i> of the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, which the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> concerning the <i>lattie</i> of Ahab: for the <i>Duchess</i> hath done that which <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> by <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i> Elijah.
    </li>
    <li>So Jehu <i>ferricadoozaed</i> all that remained of the <i>lattie</i> of Ahab in Jezreel, and all <i>her</i> <i>dowry</i> <i>homies</i>, and <i>her</i> kinsfolks, and <i>her</i> <i>godly homies</i>, until <i>she</i> <i>dry</i> <i>her</i> none remaining.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> arose and <i>trolled off</i>, and <i>trolled</i> to Samaria. And as <i>she</i> was at the shearing <i>lattie</i> in the way,
    </li>
    <li>Jehu met with the <i>sisters</i> of Ahaziah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, and <i>cackled</i>, Who are ye? And they answered, We are the <i>sisters</i> of Ahaziah; and we <i>troll</i> down to salute the <i>chavvies</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> and the <i>chavvies</i> of the <i>dowriest palone</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>lell</i> them alive. And they <i>lelled</i> them alive, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> them at the pit of the shearing <i>lattie</i>, even <i>dewey</i> and <i>quarter dacha</i> <i>homies</i>; <i>nishta</i> <i>dry</i> <i>she</i> any of them.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> was <i>trolled off</i> thence, <i>she</i> lighted on Jehonadab the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Rechab <i>trolling</i> to meet <i>her</i>: and <i>she</i> saluted <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i> to <i>her</i>, Is thine <i>thumping cheat</i> <i>sweet</i>, as my <i>thumping cheat</i> is with thy <i>thumping cheat</i>? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, <i>parker</i> me thine <i>famble</i>. And <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>; and <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> up to <i>her</i> into the <i>trundling cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>troll</i> with me, and <i>varda</i> my zeal for the <i>Duchess</i>. So they made <i>her</i> ride in <i>her</i> <i>trundling cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> to Samaria, <i>she</i> <i>ferricadoozaed</i> all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till <i>she</i> had <i>battyfanged</i> <i>her</i>, according to the <i>cackling</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, which <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> to Elijah.
    </li>
    <li>And Jehu gathered all the <i>homies and palones</i> together, and <i>cackled</i> unto them, Ahab served Baal a <i>bijou</i>; but Jehu shall serve <i>her</i> <i>dowry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now therefore <i>screech</i> unto me all the prophets of Baal, all <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>, and all <i>her</i> <i>godly homies</i>; let none be wanting: for I have a <i>dowry</i> <i>parker</i> to do to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, <i>she</i> shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent that <i>she</i> might <i>battyfang</i> the worshippers of Baal.
    </li>
    <li>And Jehu <i>cackled</i>, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it.
    </li>
    <li>And Jehu <i>laued</i> through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal <i>trolled</i>, so that there was not a <i>homie</i> <i>dry</i> that <i>trolled</i> not. And they <i>trolled</i> into the <i>lattie</i> of Baal; and the <i>lattie</i> of Baal was full from <i>una</i> end to another.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> that was over the vestry, <i>parker</i> forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And <i>she</i> brought them forth vestments.
    </li>
    <li>And Jehu <i>trolled</i>, and Jehonadab the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Rechab, into the <i>lattie</i> of Baal, and <i>cackled</i> unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and <i>varda</i> that there be here with you none of the <i>serving homies</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, but the worshippers of Baal only.
    </li>
    <li>And when they <i>trolled</i> in to offer <i>parkers</i> and burnt <i>parkerings</i>, Jehu appointed fourscore <i>homies</i> <i>nanti</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, If any of the <i>homies</i> whom I have brought into your <i>fambles</i> escape, <i>she</i> that letteth <i>her</i> <i>troll</i>, <i>her</i> life shall be for the life of <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, as soon as <i>she</i> had made an end of <i>parkering</i> the burnt <i>parkering</i>, that Jehu <i>cackled</i> to the <i>charpering homie</i> and to the captains, <i>troll</i> in, and <i>ferricadooza</i> them; let none <i>troll</i> forth. And they <i>slapped</i> them with the edge of the <i>dowry efink</i>; and the <i>charpering homie</i> and the captains cast them out, and <i>trolled</i> to the <i>smoke</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of Baal.
    </li>
    <li>And they brought forth the images out of the <i>lattie</i> of Baal, and burned them.
    </li>
    <li>And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the <i>lattie</i> of Baal, and made it a draught <i>lattie</i> unto this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Thus Jehu <i>battyfanged</i> Baal out of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>Howbeit from the <i>kertervers</i> of Jeroboam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nebat, who made Israel to <i>kertever</i>, Jehu <i>trolled off</i> not from after them, to wit, the golden calves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing that which is <i>sweet</i> in mine <i>ogles</i>, and hast done unto the <i>lattie</i> of Ahab according to all that was in mine <i>thumping cheat</i>, thy <i>chavvies</i> of the <i>quarter</i> generation shall <i>lett</i> on the throne of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>But Jehu <i>lelled</i> no heed to <i>mince</i> in the law of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel with all <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>: for <i>she</i> <i>trolled off</i> not from the <i>kertervers</i> of Jeroboam, which made Israel to <i>kertever</i>.
    </li>
    <li>In those days the <i>Duchess</i> began to cut Israel short: and Hazael <i>slapped</i> them in all the coasts of Israel;
    </li>
    <li>From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.
    </li>
    <li>Now the <i>lettie</i> of the acts of Jehu, and all that <i>she</i> did, and all <i>her</i> might, are they not <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the chronicles of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Israel?
    </li>
    <li>And Jehu <i>lettied</i> with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>: and they buried <i>her</i> in Samaria. And Jehoahaz <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> reigned in <i>her</i> stead.
    </li>
    <li>And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was <i>dewey dacha</i> and <i>say dooe</i> years.

    <h2>Chapter 11</h2>

    <li>And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah <i>vardad</i> that her <i>homie chavvie</i> was <i>stiff</i>, she arose and <i>battyfanged</i> all the <i>maria</i> royal.
    </li>
    <li>But Jehosheba, the <i>palone chavvie</i> of <i>dowriest homie</i> Joram, sister of Ahaziah, <i>lelled</i> Joash the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ahaziah, and <i>sharpered</i> <i>her</i> from among the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>homie chavvies</i> which were <i>ferricadoozed</i>; and they hid <i>her</i>, even <i>her</i> and <i>her</i> nurse, in the <i>pallias</i> from Athaliah, so that <i>she</i> was not <i>ferricadoozed</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> was with her hid in the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>sey</i> years. And Athaliah did reign over the land.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>setterth</i> year Jehoiada <i>laued</i> and fetched the rulers over <i>chenters</i>, with the captains and the <i>charpering homie</i>, and brought them to <i>her</i> into the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and made a covenant with them, and <i>lelled</i> an oath of them in the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and shewed them the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>homie chavvie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> commanded them, <i>cackling</i>, This is the <i>fakement</i> that ye shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the <i>varda</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And a third part shall be at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the <i>charpering homie</i>: so shall ye keep the <i>varda</i> of the <i>lattie</i>, that it be not broken down.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>dewey</i> parts of all you that <i>troll forth</i> on the sabbath, even they shall keep the <i>varda</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> about the <i>dowriest homie</i>.

    <li>And ye shall compass the <i>dowriest homie</i> round about, every <i>homie</i> with <i>her</i> weapons in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>: and <i>she</i> that <i>trolleth</i> within the ranges, let <i>her</i> be <i>ferricadoozed</i>: and be ye with the <i>dowriest homie</i> as <i>she</i> goeth out and as <i>she</i> <i>trolleth</i> in.
    </li>
    <li>And the captains over the <i>chenters</i> did according to all <i>fakements</i> that Jehoiada the <i>godly homie</i> commanded: and they <i>lelled</i> every <i>homie</i> <i>her</i> <i>homies</i> that were to <i>troll</i> in on the sabbath, with them that should <i>troll out</i> on the sabbath, and <i>trolled</i> to Jehoiada the <i>godly homie</i>.

    <li>And to the captains over <i>chenters</i> did the <i>godly homie</i> <i>parker</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>Davina</i>&#8216;s spears and shields, that were in the <i>holy carsey</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.

    <li>And <i>she</i> brought forth the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>homie chavvie</i>, and put the <i>mudge</i> upon <i>her</i>, and <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> the testimony; and they made <i>her</i> <i>dowriest homie</i>, and anointed <i>her</i>; and they clapped their <i>fambles</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>Gloria</i> save the <i>dowriest homie</i>.

    <li>And when Athaliah <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>screech</i> of the <i>charpering homie</i> and of the <i>homies and palones</i>, she <i>trolled</i> to the <i>homies and palones</i> into the <i>holy carsey</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.

    <li>But Jehoiada the <i>godly homie</i> commanded the captains of the <i>chenters</i>, the <i>hilda handcuffs</i> of the host, and <i>cackled</i> unto them, Have her forth <i>nanti</i> the ranges: and <i>her</i> that followeth her <i>ferricadoza</i> with the <i>dowry efink</i>.

    <li>And all the <i>homies and palones</i> of the land <i>trolled</i> into the <i>lattie</i> of Baal, and brake it down; <i>her</i> altars and <i>her</i> images brake they in pieces thoroughly, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> Mattan the <i>godly homie</i> of Baal before the altars.

    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> the rulers over <i>chenters</i>, and the captains, and the <i>charpering homie</i>, and all the <i>homies and palones</i> of the land; and they brought down the <i>dowriest homie</i> from the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>trolled</i> by the way of the gate of the <i>charpering homie</i> to the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>.

    <h2>Chapter 12</h2>

    <li>In the <i>setterth</i> year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign; and <i>quarter dacha</i> years reigned <i>she</i> in Jerusalem. And <i>her</i> mother&#8217;s name was Zibiah of Beersheba.
    </li>
    <li>And Jehoash did that which was <i>sweet</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> all <i>her</i> days wherein Jehoiada the <i>godly homie</i> instructed <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But the high places were not <i>lelled</i> away: the <i>homies and palones</i> still sacrificed and burnt <i>smelly</i> in the high places.
    </li>
    <li>And Jehoash <i>cackled</i> to the <i>godly homies</i>, All the <i>dinarly</i> of the dedicated <i>fakements</i> that is brought into the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, even the <i>dinarly</i> of every <i>una</i> that passeth the account, the <i>dinarly</i> that every <i>homie</i> is set at, and all the <i>dinarly</i> that <i>trolleth</i> into any <i>homie</i>&#8216;s <i>thumping cheat</i> to <i>parker</i> into the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>,

    <li>Let the <i>godly homies</i> <i>lell</i> it to them, every <i>homie</i> of <i>her</i> acquaintance: and let them repair the breaches of the <i>lattie</i>, wheresoever any breach shall be found.

    <li>But it was so, that in the <i>trey</i> and <i>dewey dachath</i> year of <i>dowriest homie</i> Jehoash the <i>godly homies</i> had not repaired the breaches of the <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>dowriest homie</i> Jehoash <i>screeched</i> for Jehoiada the <i>godly homie</i>, and the other <i>godly homies</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the <i>lattie</i>? now therefore <i>lall</i> <i>nishta</i> <i>dinarly</i> of your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>godly homies</i> consented to <i>lall</i> <i>nishta</i> <i>dinarly</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>nishta</i> to repair the breaches of the <i>lattie</i>.

    <li>But Jehoiada the <i>godly homie</i> <i>lelled</i> a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the <i>grovelling fakement</i>, on the <i>sweet</i> side as <i>una</i> <i>trolleth</i> into the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>: and the <i>godly homies</i> that kept the door put therein all the <i>dinarly</i> that was brought into the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.

    <li>And it was so, when they <i>vardad</i> that there was <i>dowry</i> <i>dinarly</i> in the chest, that the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s scribe and the high <i>godly homie</i> <i>trolled</i> up, and they put up in bags, and <i>cackled</i> the <i>dinarly</i> that was found in the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.

    <li>Howbeit there were not made for the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> bowls of silver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, any <i>fakements</i> of <i>gelt</i>, or <i>fakements</i> of silver, of the <i>dinarly</i> that was brought into the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>:

And Joash the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel <i>trolled</i> down unto <i>her</i>, and <i>parnied</i> over <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, O my <i>Auntie</i>, my <i>Auntie</i>, the <i>trundling cheat</i> of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.
    </li>
    <li>And Elisha <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>lell</i> bow and arrows. And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> unto <i>her</i> bow and arrows.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> to the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel, Put thine <i>famble</i> upon the bow. And <i>she</i> put <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> upon it: and Elisha put <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i> upon the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>fambles</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Open the window eastward. And <i>she</i> opened it. Then Elisha <i>cackled</i>, Shoot. And <i>she</i> shot. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, The arrow of the <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria: for thou shalt <i>slap</i> the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed them.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>lell</i> the arrows. And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> them. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel, <i>slap</i> upon the ground. And <i>she</i> <i>slapped</i> thrice, and stayed.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> was <i>dander</i> with <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Thou shouldest have smitten <i>chinker</i> or <i>sey</i> times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it: whereas now thou shalt <i>slap</i> Syria but thrice.
    </li>
    <li>And Elisha <i>carked it</i>, and they buried <i>her</i>. And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the <i>trolling</i> in of the year.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, as they were burying a <i>homie</i>, that, <i>varda</i>, they <i>vardad</i> a band of <i>homies</i>; and they cast the <i>homie</i> into the sepulchre of Elisha: and when the <i>homie</i> was let down, and <i>reefed</i> the bones of Elisha, <i>she</i> revived, and stood up on <i>her</i> <i>plates</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But Hazael <i>dowriest homie</i> of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> was <i>bona</i> unto them, and had compassion on them, and had respect unto them, because of <i>her</i> covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not <i>battyfang</i> them, <i>nishta</i> cast <i>she</i> them from <i>her</i> presence as yet.

    <li>So Hazael <i>dowriest homie</i> of Syria <i>carked it</i>; and Benhadad <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> reigned in <i>her</i> stead.

    <li>And Jehoash the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jehoahaz <i>lelled</i> again out of the <i>famble</i> of Benhadad the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Hazael the <i>smokes</i>, which <i>she</i> had <i>lelled</i> out of the <i>famble</i> of Jehoahaz <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> by <i>barney</i>. <i>Trey</i> times did Joash <i>zsa zsa-ed</i> <i>her</i>, and recovered the <i>smokes</i> of Israel.

    <li><i>She</i> was <i>dewey dacha</i> and <i>chinker</i> years <i>badge</i> when <i>she</i> began to reign, and reigned <i>dewey dacha</i> and <i>sey trey</i> years in Jerusalem. And <i>her</i> mother&#8217;s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> did that which was <i>sweet</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, yet not like <i>Davina</i> <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>: <i>she</i> did according to all <i>fakements</i> as Joash <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> did.
    </li>
    <li>Howbeit the high places were not <i>lelled</i> away: as yet the <i>homies and palones</i> did <i>parker</i> and burnt <i>smelly</i> on the high places.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>, that <i>she</i> <i>ferricadoozaed</i> <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i> which had <i>ferricadoozed</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>.

    <li>But the <i>chavvies</i> of the murderers <i>she</i> <i>ferricadoozaed</i> not: according unto that which is <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the law of <i>Maureen</i>, wherein the <i>Duchess</i> commanded, <i>cackling</i>, The <i>aunties</i> shall not be put to <i>carking it</i> for the <i>chavvies</i>, <i>nishta</i> the <i>chavvies</i> be put to <i>carking it</i> for the <i>aunties</i>; but every <i>homie</i> shall be put to <i>carking it</i> for <i>her</i> own <i>kertever</i>.

    <li><i>She</i> <i>ferricadoozaed</i> of Edom in the valley of salt <i>dacha</i> <i>mille</i>, and <i>lelled</i> Selah by <i>barney</i>, and <i>screeched</i> the name of it Joktheel unto this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then Amaziah <i>laued</i> messengers to Jehoash, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jehoahaz <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jehu, <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel, <i>cackling</i>, <i>troll</i>, let us <i>varda</i> <i>una</i> another in the <i>eke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Jehoash the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel <i>laued</i> to Amaziah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, <i>cackling</i>, The thistle that was in Lebanon <i>laued</i> to the cedar that was in Lebanon, <i>cackling</i>, <i>parker</i> thy <i>palone chavvie</i> to my <i>homie chavvie</i> to <i>palone affair</i>: and there <i>trolled by</i> a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.
    </li>
    <li>Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine <i>thumping cheat</i> hath lifted thee up: <i>fabeness</i> of this, and tarry at home: for why shouldest thou meddle to thy hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?
    </li>
    <li>But Amaziah would not <i>aunt nell</i>. Therefore Jehoash <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel <i>trolled</i> up; and <i>she</i> and Amaziah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah looked <i>una</i> another in the <i>eke</i> at Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah.
    </li>
    <li>And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every <i>homie</i> to their <i>trolling letties</i>.

    <li>And Jehoash <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel <i>lelled</i> Amaziah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Jehoash the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh, and <i>trolled</i> to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, <i>quarter</i> <i>chenter</i> cubits.

    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> all the <i>gelt</i> and silver, and all the <i>fakements</i> that were found in the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and in the <i>gelt</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, and hostages, and <i>trolled back to</i> Samaria.

    <li>Now they made a conspiracy against <i>her</i> in Jerusalem: and <i>she</i> fled to Lachish; but they <i>laued</i> after <i>her</i> to Lachish, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> <i>her</i> there.
    </li>
    <li>And they brought <i>her</i> on horses: and <i>she</i> was buried at Jerusalem with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i> in the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And all the <i>homies and palones</i> of Judah <i>lelled</i> Azariah, which was sixteen years <i>badge</i>, and made <i>her</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> instead of <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> Amaziah.

    <li><i>She</i> built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>lettied</i> with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>.

    <li>In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Joash <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah Jeroboam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Joash <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel began to reign in Samaria, and reigned <i>quarter dacha</i> and <i>una</i> years.

    <li><i>She</i> restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath unto the sea of the plain, according to the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, which <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> by the <i>famble</i> of <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i> Jonah, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Amittai, the prophet, which was of Gathhepher.

    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> not that <i>she</i> would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven: but <i>she</i> saved them by the <i>famble</i> of Jeroboam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Joash.
    </li>
    <li>Now the <i>lettie</i> of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that <i>she</i> did, and <i>her</i> might, how <i>she</i> warred, and how <i>she</i> recovered Damascus, and Hamath, which belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the chronicles of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Israel?

    <li>And <i>dowriest homie</i> Ahaz commanded Urijah the <i>godly homie</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Upon the <i>dowry</i> <i>grovelling fakement</i> burn the morning burnt <i>parkering</i>, and the <i>bijou nochy</i> <i>carnish</i> <i>parkering</i>, and the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s burnt <i>parker</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>carnish</i> <i>parkering</i>, with the burnt <i>parkering</i> of all the <i>homies and palones</i> of the land, and their <i>carnish</i> <i>parkering</i>, and their <i>buvare</i> <i>parkerings</i>; and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt <i>parkering</i>, and all the blood of the <i>parker</i>: and the brasen <i>grovelling fakement</i> shall be for me to enquire by.
    </li>
    <li>Thus did Urijah the <i>godly homie</i>, according to all that <i>dowriest homie</i> Ahaz commanded.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>dowriest homie</i> Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off them; and <i>lelled</i> down the sea from off the brasen oxen that were under it, and put it upon the pavement of stones.
    </li>
    <li>And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the <i>lattie</i>, and the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s entry <i>nanti</i>, turned <i>she</i> from the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> for the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria.
    </li>
    <li>Now the <i>lettie</i> of the acts of Ahaz which <i>she</i> did, are they not <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the chronicles of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Judah?
    </li>
    <li>And Ahaz <i>lettied</i> with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>, and was buried with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i> in the <i>smoke</i> of <i>Davina</i>: and Hezekiah <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> reigned in <i>her</i> stead.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 17</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>In the twelfth year of Ahaz <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah began Hoshea the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel <i>sey trey</i> years.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> did that which was <i>nana</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, but not as the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Israel that were before <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Against <i>her</i> <i>trolled</i> up Shalmaneser <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria; and Hoshea became <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i>, and <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> presents.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for <i>she</i> had <i>laued</i> messengers to So <i>dowriest homie</i> of Egypt, and brought no present to the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria, as <i>she</i> had done year by year: therefore the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria shut <i>her</i> up, and bound <i>her</i> in <i>charpering carsey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria <i>trolled</i> up throughout all the land, and <i>trolled</i> up to Samaria, and besieged it <i>trey</i> years.
    </li>
    <li>In the ninth year of Hoshea the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria <i>lelled</i> Samaria, and <i>lelled</i> Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the <i>smokes</i> of the Medes.
    </li>
    <li>For so it was, that the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel had <i>kertervered</i> against the <i>Duchess</i> their <i>Gloria</i>, which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the <i>famble</i> of Pharaoh <i>dowriest homie</i> of Egypt, and had feared other gods,
    </li>
    <li>And <i>minced</i> in the <i>dowry lavs</i> of the heathen, whom the <i>Duchess</i> cast out from before the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, and of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Israel, which they had made.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel did secretly those <i>fakements</i> that were not <i>sweet</i> against the <i>Duchess</i> their <i>Gloria</i>, and they built them high places in all their <i>smokes</i>, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced <i>smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and under every green tree:
    </li>
    <li>And there they burnt <i>smelly</i> in all the high places, as did the heathen whom the <i>Duchess</i> <i>lelled</i> away before them; and wrought <i>naff</i> <i>fakements</i> to provoke the <i>Duchess</i> to <i>wild</i>:
    </li>
    <li>For they served idols, whereof the <i>Duchess</i> had <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>nanti</i> do this <i>fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Yet the <i>Duchess</i> testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the prophets, and by all the seers, <i>cackling</i>, Turn ye from your <i>nana</i> ways, and keep my <i>butch lavs</i> and my <i>dowry lavs</i>, according to all the law which I commanded your <i>aunties</i>, and which I <i>laued</i> to you by my <i>serving homies</i> the prophets.
    </li>
    <li>Notwithstanding they would not <i>aunt nell</i>, but hardened their necks, like to the neck of their <i>aunties</i>, that did not believe in the <i>Duchess</i> their <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they rejected <i>her</i> <i>dowry lavs</i>, and <i>her</i> covenant that <i>she</i> made with their <i>aunties</i>, and <i>her</i> testimonies which <i>she</i> testified against them; and they <i>trolled after</i> <i>spangly</i>, and became vain, and <i>trolled</i> after the heathen that were round about them, concerning whom the <i>Duchess</i> had charged them, that they should not do like them.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>dry</i> all the <i>butch lavs</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> their <i>Gloria</i>, and made them molten images, even <i>dewey</i> calves, and made a grove, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.
    </li>
    <li>And they caused their <i>homie chavvies</i> and their <i>palone chavvies</i> to pass through the <i>binco fakement</i>, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do <i>nana</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, to provoke <i>her</i> to <i>wild</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore the <i>Duchess</i> was <i>dowry</i> angry with Israel, and removed them out of <i>her</i> <i>vardaing</i>: there was none <i>dry</i> but the tribe of Judah only.
    </li>
    <li>Also Judah kept not the <i>butch lavs</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> their <i>Gloria</i>, but <i>minced</i> in the <i>dowry lavs</i> of Israel which they made.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> rejected all the <i>maria</i> of Israel, and afflicted them, and <i>laued</i> them into the <i>famble</i> of spoilers, until <i>she</i> had cast them out of <i>her</i> <i>vardaing</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> rent Israel from the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Davina</i>; and they made Jeroboam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nebat <i>dowriest homie</i>: and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the <i>Duchess</i>, and made them <i>kertever</i> a <i>dowry</i> <i>kertever</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>minced</i> in all the <i>kertervers</i> of Jeroboam which <i>she</i> did; they <i>trolled off</i> not from them;
    </li>
    <li>Until the <i>Duchess</i> removed Israel out of <i>her</i> <i>vardaing</i>, as <i>she</i> had <i>cackled</i> by all <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i> the prophets. So was Israel <i>lelled</i> away out of their own land to Assyria unto this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria brought <i>homies</i> from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the <i>smokes</i> of Samaria instead of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and <i>letted</i> in the <i>smokes</i> thereof.
    </li>
    <li>And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not the <i>Duchess</i>: therefore the <i>Duchess</i> <i>laued</i> lions among them, which <i>ferricadoozaed</i> some of them.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore they <i>cackled</i> to the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria, <i>cackling</i>, The nations which thou hast removed, and placed in the <i>smokes</i> of Samaria, know not the manner of the <i>Gloria</i> of the land: therefore <i>she</i> hath <i>laued</i> lions among them, and, <i>varda</i>, they <i>ferricadooza</i> them, because they know not the manner of the <i>Gloria</i> of the land.
    </li>
    <li>Then the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria commanded, <i>cackling</i>, Carry thither <i>una</i> of the <i>godly homies</i> whom ye brought from thence; and let them <i>troll</i> and <i>lett</i> there, and let <i>her</i> teach them the manner of the <i>Gloria</i> of the land.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>una</i> of the <i>godly homies</i> whom they had <i>lelled</i> away from Samaria <i>trolled</i> and <i>letted</i> in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the <i>latties</i> of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their <i>smokes</i> wherein they <i>letted</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>homies</i> of Babylon made Succothbenoth, and the <i>homies</i> of Cuth made Nergal, and the <i>homies</i> of Hamath made Ashima,
    </li>
    <li>And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their <i>chavvies</i> in <i>binco fakement</i> to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.
    </li>
    <li>So they feared the <i>Duchess</i>, and made unto themselves of the lowest of them <i>godly homies</i> of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the <i>latties</i> of the high places.
    </li>
    <li>They feared the <i>Duchess</i>, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations whom they <i>lelled</i> away from thence.
    </li>
    <li>Unto this <i>journo</i> they do after the former manners: they fear not the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>nishta</i> do they after their <i>dowry lavs</i>, or after their ordinances, or after the law and <i>butch lav</i> which the <i>Duchess</i> commanded the <i>chavvies</i> of Jacob, whom <i>she</i> named Israel;
    </li>
    <li>With whom the <i>Duchess</i> had made a covenant, and charged them, <i>cackling</i>, <i>nanti</i> fear other gods, <i>nishta</i> bow yourselves to them, <i>nishta</i> serve them, <i>nishta</i> <i>parker</i> to them:
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>Duchess</i>, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with <i>dowry</i> power and a stretched out arm, <i>her</i> shall ye fear, and <i>her</i> shall ye worship, and to <i>her</i> shall ye do <i>parker</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowry lavs</i>, and the ordinances, and the law, and the <i>butch lav</i>, which <i>she</i> <i>screeved</i> for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; and <i>nanti</i> fear other gods.
    </li>
    <li>And the covenant that I have made with you <i>nanti</i> forget; <i>nishta</i> shall ye fear other gods.
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i> ye shall fear; and <i>she</i> shall deliver you out of the <i>famble</i> of all your enemies.
    </li>
    <li>Howbeit they did not <i>aunt nell</i>, but they did after their former manner.
    </li>
    <li>So these nations feared the <i>Duchess</i>, and served their graven images, both their <i>chavvies</i>, and their <i>chavvies</i>&#8216;s <i>chavvies</i>: as did their <i>aunties</i>, so do they unto this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 18</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Now it <i>trolled</i> to pass in the third year of Hoshea <i>homie chavvie</i> of Elah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel, that Hezekiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ahaz <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah began to reign.
    </li>
    <li><i>Dewey dacha</i> and <i>chinker</i> years <i>badge</i> was <i>she</i> when <i>she</i> began to reign; and <i>she</i> reigned <i>dewey dacha</i> and <i>sey trey</i> years in Jerusalem. <i>Her</i> mother&#8217;s name also was Abi, the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Zachariah.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> did that which was <i>sweet</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, according to all that <i>Davina</i> <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> did.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down the groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that <i>Maureen</i> had made: for unto those days the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel did burn <i>smelly</i> to it: and <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> it Nehushtan.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> trusted in the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel; so that after <i>her</i> was none like <i>her</i> among all the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Judah, <i>nishta</i> any that were before <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> clave to the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>trolled off</i> not from following <i>her</i>, but kept <i>her</i> <i>butch lavs</i>, which the <i>Duchess</i> commanded <i>Maureen</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> was with <i>her</i>; and <i>she</i> prospered whithersoever <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> forth: and <i>she</i> rebelled against the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria, and served <i>her</i> not.
    </li>
    <li><i>She</i> <i>slapped</i> the <i>naffs</i>, even unto Gaza, and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced <i>smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> in the <i>quarter</i> year of <i>dowriest homie</i> Hezekiah, which was the <i>setterth</i> year of Hoshea <i>homie chavvie</i> of Elah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel, that Shalmaneser <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria <i>trolled</i> up against Samaria, and besieged it.
    </li>
    <li>And at the end of <i>trey</i> years they <i>lelled</i> it: even in the <i>seyth</i> year of Hezekiah, that is in the ninth year of Hoshea <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel, Samaria was <i>lelled</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the <i>smokes</i> of the Medes:
    </li>
    <li>Because they obeyed not the <i>cackling fakement</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> their <i>Gloria</i>, but transgressed <i>her</i> covenant, and all that <i>Maureen</i> the <i>serving homie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> commanded, and would not <i>aunt nell</i> them, <i>nishta</i> do them.
    </li>
    <li>Now in the fourteenth year of <i>dowriest homie</i> Hezekiah did Sennacherib <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria <i>troll</i> up against all the fenced <i>smokes</i> of Judah, and <i>lelled</i> them.
    </li>
    <li>And Hezekiah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah <i>laued</i> to the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria to Lachish, <i>cackling</i>, I have offended; return from me: that which thou puttest on me will I bear. And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah <i>trey</i> <i>chenter</i> talents of silver and <i>trey dacha</i> talents of <i>gelt</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Hezekiah <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> all the silver that was found in the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and in the <i>gelt</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>At that time did Hezekiah cut off the <i>gelt</i> from the doors of the <i>holy carsey</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and from the pillars which Hezekiah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah had overlaid, and <i>parkered</i> it to the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria <i>laued</i> Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to <i>dowriest homie</i> Hezekiah with a <i>dowry</i> host against Jerusalem. And they <i>trolled</i> up and <i>trolled</i> to Jerusalem. And when they were <i>troll</i> up, they <i>trolled</i> and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller&#8217;s field.
    </li>
    <li>And when they had <i>screeched</i> to the <i>dowriest homie</i>, there <i>trolled</i> out to them Eliakim the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Asaph the recorder.
    </li>
    <li>And Rabshakeh <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>cackle</i> ye now to Hezekiah, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>dowry</i> <i>dowriest homie</i>, the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?
    </li>
    <li>Thou <i>cackleth</i>, (but they are but vain <i>lavs</i>,) I have counsel and <i>butchness</i> for the <i>barney</i>. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?
    </li>
    <li>Now, <i>varda</i>, thou trustest upon the <i>trolling fakement</i> of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt, on which if a <i>homie</i> lean, it will <i>troll</i> into <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh <i>dowriest homie</i> of Egypt unto all that trust on <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But if ye <i>cackle</i> unto me, We trust in the <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i>: is not that <i>she</i>, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath <i>lelled</i> away, and hath <i>cackled</i> to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this <i>grovelling fakement</i> in Jerusalem?
    </li>
    <li>Now therefore, I pray thee, <i>parker</i> pledges to my <i>Duchess</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria, and I will deliver thee <i>dewey</i> <i>mille</i> horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.
    </li>
    <li>How then wilt thou turn away the <i>eke</i> of <i>una</i> captain of the <i>nanti dowriest</i> of my master&#8217;s <i>serving homies</i>, and put thy trust on Egypt for <i>rattling coves</i> and for horsemen?
    </li>
    <li>Am I now <i>troll</i> up <i>nanti</i> the <i>Duchess</i> against this place to <i>battyfang</i> it? The <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> to me, <i>troll</i> up against this land, and <i>battyfang</i> it.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> Eliakim the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, unto Rabshakeh, <i>cackle</i>, I pray thee, to thy <i>serving homies</i> in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and talk not with us in the <i>kosher homies</i>&#8216; language in the <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i> that are on the wall.
    </li>
    <li>But Rabshakeh <i>cackled</i> unto them, Hath my master <i>laued</i> me to thy master, and to thee, to <i>cackle</i> these <i>lavs</i>? hath <i>she</i> not <i>laued</i> me to the <i>homies</i> which <i>lett</i> on the wall, that they may <i>jarry</i> their own dung, and <i>buvare</i> their own piss with you?
    </li>
    <li>Then Rabshakeh stood and <i>screeched</i> with a loud <i>cackling fakement</i> in the <i>kosher homies</i>&#8216; language, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>aunt nell</i> the <i>lav</i> of the <i>dowry</i> <i>dowriest homie</i>, the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria:
    </li>
    <li>Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>, Let not Hezekiah <i>mogue</i> you: for <i>she</i> shall not be able to deliver you out of <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>:
    </li>
    <li><i>Nishta</i> let Hezekiah make you trust in the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>cackling</i>, The <i>Duchess</i> will surely deliver us, and this <i>smoke</i> shall not be <i>laued</i> into the <i>famble</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria.
    </li>
    <li><i>Aunt nell</i> not to Hezekiah: for thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a present, and <i>troll</i> out to me, and then <i>jarry</i> ye every <i>homie</i> of <i>her</i> own vine, and every <i>una</i> of <i>her</i> fig tree, and <i>buvare</i> ye every <i>una</i> the <i>aquas</i> of <i>her</i> cistern:
    </li>
    <li>Until I <i>troll</i> and <i>lell</i> you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and <i>sherry</i>, a land of <i>pannan</i> and vineyards, a land of <i>lube</i> olive and of honey, that ye may live, and not <i>cark it</i>: and <i>aunt nell</i> not unto Hezekiah, when <i>she</i> persuadeth you, <i>cackling</i>, The <i>Duchess</i> will deliver us.
    </li>
    <li>Hath any of the gods of the nations <i>laued</i> at all <i>her</i> land out of the <i>famble</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria?
    </li>
    <li>Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they <i>laued</i> Samaria out of mine <i>famble</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have <i>laued</i> their country out of mine <i>famble</i>, that the <i>Duchess</i> should deliver Jerusalem out of mine <i>famble</i>?
    </li>
    <li>But the <i>homies and palones</i> held their peace, and answered <i>her</i> not a <i>lav</i>: for the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>butch lav</i> was, <i>cackling</i>, Answer <i>her</i> not.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>trolled</i> Eliakim the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their <i>zhoosh</i> rent, and <i>cackled</i> <i>her</i> the <i>lavs</i> of Rabshakeh.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 19</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, when <i>dowriest homie</i> Hezekiah <i>aunt nelled</i> it, that <i>she</i> rent <i>her</i> <i>zhoosh</i>, and covered himself with <i>nylon</i>, and <i>trolled</i> into the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> Eliakim, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the <i>fungi</i> of the <i>godly homies</i>, covered with <i>nylon</i>, to Isaiah the prophet the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Amoz.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> Hezekiah, This <i>journo</i> is a <i>journo</i> of trouble, and of rebuke, and <i>billingsgate</i>; for the <i>chavvies</i> are <i>troll</i> to the birth, and there is not <i>butchness</i> to <i>parker</i> forth.
    </li>
    <li>It may be the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> will <i>aunt nell</i> all the <i>lavs</i> of Rabshakeh, whom the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria <i>her</i> master hath <i>laued</i> to reproach the living <i>Gloria</i>; and will reprove the <i>lavs</i> which the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>aunt nelled</i>: wherefore lift up thy <i>meshigener muttering</i> for the remnant that are <i>dry</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So the <i>serving homies</i> of <i>dowriest homie</i> Hezekiah <i>trolled</i> to Isaiah.
    </li>
    <li>And Isaiah <i>cackled</i> unto them, Thus shall ye <i>cackle</i> to your master, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, Be not afraid of the <i>lavs</i> which thou hast <i>aunt nelled</i>, with which the <i>serving homies</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria have blasphemed me.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, I will <i>lau</i> a blast upon <i>her</i>, and <i>she</i> shall <i>aunt nell</i> a <i>gossip</i>, and shall <i>troll back to</i> <i>her</i> own land; and I will cause <i>her</i> to fall by the <i>dowry efink</i> in <i>her</i> own land.
    </li>
    <li>So Rabshakeh <i>trolled back</i>, and found the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria warring against Libnah: for <i>she</i> had <i>aunt nelled</i> that <i>she</i> was <i>trolled off</i> from Lachish.
    </li>
    <li>And when <i>she</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> <i>cackle</i> of Tirhakah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Ethiopia, <i>varda</i>, <i>she</i> is <i>troll</i> out to <i>palaver</i> against thee: <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> messengers again unto Hezekiah, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Thus shall ye <i>cackle</i> to Hezekiah <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, <i>cackling</i>, Let not thy <i>Gloria</i> in whom thou trustest <i>mogue</i> thee, <i>cackling</i>, Jerusalem shall not be <i>laued</i> into the <i>famble</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, thou hast <i>aunt nelled</i> what the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be <i>laued</i>?
    </li>
    <li>Have the gods of the nations <i>laued</i> them which my <i>aunties</i> have <i>battyfanged</i>; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the <i>chavvies</i> of Eden which were in Thelasar?
    </li>
    <li>Where is the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Hamath, and the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Arpad, and the <i>dowriest homie</i> of the <i>smoke</i> of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah?
    </li>
    <li>And Hezekiah <i>lalled</i> the letter of the <i>famble</i> of the messengers, and <i>varda the lavs</i> it: and Hezekiah <i>trolled</i> up into the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and spread it before the <i>Duchess</i>.

    <li>And Hezekiah prayed before the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, O <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, which dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the <i>Gloria</i>, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth.
    </li>
    <li><i>Duchess</i>, bow down thine <i>aunt nelling cheat</i>, and <i>aunt nell</i>: open, <i>Duchess</i>, thine <i>ogles</i>, and <i>varda</i>: and <i>aunt nell</i> the <i>lavs</i> of Sennacherib, which hath <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> to reproach the living <i>Gloria</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Of a truth, <i>Duchess</i>, the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Assyria have <i>battyfanged</i> the nations and their lands,
    </li>
    <li>And have cast their gods into the <i>binco fakement</i>: for they were no gods, but the <i>acting dickey</i> of <i>homies</i>&#8216;s <i>fambles</i>, wood and stone: therefore they have <i>battyfanged</i> them.
    </li>
    <li>Now therefore, O <i>Duchess</i> our <i>Gloria</i>, I beseech thee, save thou us out of <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i>, even thou only.
    </li>
    <li>Then Isaiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Amoz <i>laued</i> to Hezekiah, <i>cackling</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, That which thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria I have <i>aunt nelled</i>.
    </li>
    <li>This is the <i>lav</i> that the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>cackled</i> concerning <i>her</i>; The <i>nanti charver</i> the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Zion hath despised thee, and <i>tittered</i> thee to scorn; the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Jerusalem hath shaken her <i>eke</i> at thee.
    </li>
    <li>Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy <i>cackling fakement</i>, and lifted up thine <i>ogles</i> on high? even against the <i>fabulosa</i> <i>una</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>By thy messengers thou hast reproached the <i>Duchess</i>, and hast <i>cackled</i>, With the multitude of my <i>rattling coves</i> I am <i>troll</i> up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of <i>her</i> borders, and into the forest of <i>her</i> Carmel.
    </li>
    <li>I have digged and <i>bevvied</i> strange <i>aquas</i>, and with the sole of my <i>plates</i> have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.
    </li>
    <li>Hast thou not <i>aunt nelled</i> long ago how I have done it, and of ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to <i>lett</i> waste fenced <i>smokes</i> into ruinous heaps.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore their inhabitants were of <i>pogey</i> power, they were dismayed and <i>bamboozled</i>; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the <i>lattie</i> tops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up.
    </li>
    <li>But I know thy <i>letted</i>, and thy going out, and thy <i>trolling</i> in, and thy rage against me.
    </li>
    <li>Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is <i>troll</i> up into mine <i>aunt nelly cheats</i>, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.
    </li>
    <li>And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall <i>jarry</i> this year such <i>fakements</i> as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and <i>jarry</i> the fruits thereof.
    </li>
    <li>And the remnant that is <i>scarpered</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of Judah shall yet again <i>lell</i> root downward, and bear fruit upward.
    </li>
    <li>For out of Jerusalem shall <i>troll forth</i> a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the <i>Duchess</i> of hosts shall do this.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> concerning the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria, <i>she</i> shall not <i>troll</i> into this <i>smoke</i>, <i>nishta</i> shoot an arrow there, <i>nishta</i> <i>troll</i> before it with shield, <i>nishta</i> cast a bank against it.
    </li>
    <li>By the way that <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i>, by the same shall <i>she</i> return, and shall not <i>troll</i> into this <i>smoke</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For I will defend this <i>smoke</i>, to save it, for mine own sake, and for my <i>serving homie</i> <i>Davina</i>&#8216;s sake.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> that <i>nochy</i>, that the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> out, and <i>slapped</i> in the camp of the Assyrians an <i>chenter</i> fourscore and <i>chinker</i> <i>mille</i>: and when they arose early in the morning, <i>varda</i>, they were all <i>stiff</i> corpses.
    </li>
    <li>So Sennacherib <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria <i>trolled off</i>, and <i>trolled</i> and <i>trolled back</i>, and <i>letted</i> at Nineveh.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, as <i>she</i> was worshipping in the <i>lattie</i> of Nisroch <i>her</i> <i>Gloria</i>, that Adrammelech and Sharezer <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> <i>slapped</i> <i>her</i> with the <i>dowry efink</i>: and they <i>scarpered</i> into the land of Armenia. And Esarhaddon <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> reigned in <i>her</i> stead.

    <h2>Chapter 20</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>In those days was Hezekiah sick unto <i>carking it</i>. And the prophet Isaiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Amoz <i>trolled</i> to <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, Set thine <i>lattie</i> in order; for thou shalt <i>cark it</i>, and not live.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>she</i> turned <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> to the wall, and prayed unto the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>I beseech thee, O <i>Duchess</i>, remember now how I have <i>minced</i> before thee <i>no flies</i> and with a <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>, and have done that which is <i>bona</i> in thy <i>vardaing</i>. And Hezekiah <i>parnied</i> sore.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, afore Isaiah was <i>trolled</i> out into the middle court, that the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> to <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Turn again, and <i>cackle</i> Hezekiah the captain of my <i>homies and palones</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, the <i>Gloria</i> of <i>Davina</i> thy <i>Auntie</i>, I have <i>aunt nelled</i> thy <i>meshigener muttering</i>, I have <i>vardad</i> thy tears: <i>varda</i>, I will heal thee: on the third <i>journo</i> thou shalt <i>troll</i> up unto the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this <i>smoke</i> out of the <i>famble</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria; and I will defend this <i>smoke</i> for mine own sake, and for my <i>serving homie</i> <i>Davina</i>&#8216;s sake.
    </li>
    <li>And Isaiah <i>cackled</i>, <i>lell</i> a lump of figs. And they <i>lelled</i> and <i>laued</i> it on the boil, and <i>she</i> recovered.
    </li>
    <li>And Hezekiah <i>cackled</i> unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the <i>Duchess</i> will heal me, and that I shall <i>troll</i> up into the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> the third <i>journo</i>?
    </li>
    <li>And Isaiah <i>cackled</i>, This sign shalt thou have of the <i>Duchess</i>, that the <i>Duchess</i> will do the <i>fakement</i> that <i>she</i> hath <i>cackled</i>: shall the shadow <i>troll</i> forward <i>dacha</i> degrees, or <i>troll</i> back <i>dacha</i> degrees?
    </li>
    <li>And Hezekiah answered, It is a <i>sparkle</i> <i>fakement</i> for the shadow to <i>troll</i> down <i>dacha</i> degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward <i>dacha</i> degrees.
    </li>
    <li>And Isaiah the prophet <i>screeched</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>: and <i>she</i> brought the shadow <i>dacha</i> degrees backward, by which it had <i>trolled</i> down in the dial of Ahaz.
    </li>
    <li>At that time Berodachbaladan, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Baladan, <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon, <i>laued</i> letters and a present unto Hezekiah: for <i>she</i> had <i>aunt nelled</i> that Hezekiah had been sick.
    </li>
    <li>And Hezekiah <i>aunt nelled</i> unto them, and shewed them all the <i>lattie</i> of <i>her</i> precious <i>fakements</i>, the silver, and the <i>gelt</i>, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the <i>lattie</i> of <i>her</i> armour, and all that was found in <i>her</i> <i>gelt</i>: there was <i>nishter</i> in <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>, <i>nishta</i> in all <i>her</i> dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>trolled</i> Isaiah the prophet unto <i>dowriest homie</i> Hezekiah, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, What <i>cackled</i> these <i>homies</i>? and from whence <i>trolled</i> they unto thee? And Hezekiah <i>cackled</i>, They are <i>troll</i> from a far country, even from Babylon.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, What have they <i>vardad</i> in thine <i>lattie</i>? And Hezekiah answered, All the <i>fakements</i> that are in mine <i>lattie</i> have they <i>vardad</i>: there is <i>nishter</i> among my <i>gelt</i> that I have not shewed them.
    </li>
    <li>And Isaiah <i>cackled</i> unto Hezekiah, <i>aunt nell</i> the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Varda</i>, the days <i>troll</i>, that all that is in thine <i>lattie</i>, and that which thy <i>aunties</i> have <i>laued</i> up in store unto this <i>journo</i>, shall be <i>lelled</i> into Babylon: <i>nishter</i> shall be <i>dry</i>, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And of thy <i>homie chavvies</i> that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they <i>lell</i> away; and they shall be eunuchs in the <i>dowry lattie</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>cackled</i> Hezekiah unto Isaiah, <i>bona</i> is the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> which thou hast <i>cackled</i>. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Is it not <i>bona</i>, if peace and truth be in my days?
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>lettie</i> of the acts of Hezekiah, and all <i>her</i> might, and how <i>she</i> made a pool, and a conduit, and brought <i>aqua</i> into the <i>smoke</i>, are they not <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the chronicles of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Judah?
    </li>
    <li>And Hezekiah <i>lettied</i> with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>: and Manasseh <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> reigned in <i>her</i> stead.

    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 21</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Manasseh was <i>kenza</i> years <i>badge</i> when <i>she</i> began to reign, and reigned <i>chinker dacha</i> and <i>chinker</i> years in Jerusalem. And <i>her</i> mother&#8217;s name was Hephzibah.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> did that which was <i>nana</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, after the <i>dowry cods</i> of the heathen, whom the <i>Duchess</i> cast out before the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>she</i> built up again the high places which Hezekiah <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> had <i>battyfanged</i>; and <i>she</i> reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> built altars in the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, of which the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i>, In Jerusalem will I put my name.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> built altars for all the host of heaven in the <i>dewey</i> courts of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> made <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> pass through the <i>binco fakement</i>, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar <i>fairies</i> and wizards: <i>she</i> wrought <i>dowry</i> <i>naffness</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, to provoke <i>her</i> to <i>wild</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> set a graven image of the grove that <i>she</i> had made in the <i>lattie</i>, of which the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> to <i>Davina</i>, and to Solomon <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>, In this <i>lattie</i>, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:
    </li>
    <li><i>Nishta</i> will I make the <i>plates</i> of Israel <i>troll</i> any more out of the land which I <i>parkered</i> their <i>aunties</i>; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my <i>serving homie</i> <i>Maureen</i> commanded them.
    </li>
    <li>But they <i>aunt nelled</i> not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more <i>nana</i> than did the nations whom the <i>Duchess</i> <i>battyfanged</i> before the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> by <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i> the prophets, <i>cackling</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Because Manasseh <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah hath done these <i>dowry cods</i>, and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which were before <i>her</i>, and hath made Judah also to <i>kertever</i> with <i>her</i> idols:
    </li>
    <li>Therefore thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, <i>varda</i>, I am bringing such <i>nana</i> upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever <i>aunt nelleth</i> of it, both <i>her</i> <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> shall tingle.
    </li>
    <li>And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the <i>lattie</i> of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a <i>homie</i> wipeth a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down.
    </li>
    <li>And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into the <i>famble</i> of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;
    </li>
    <li>Because they have done that which was <i>nana</i> in my <i>vardaing</i>, and have provoked me to <i>wild</i>, since the <i>journo</i> their <i>aunties</i> <i>trolled</i> forth out of Egypt, even unto this <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry</i>, till <i>she</i> had filled Jerusalem from <i>una</i> end to another; beside <i>her</i> <i>kertever</i> wherewith <i>she</i> made Judah to <i>kertever</i>, in doing that which was <i>nana</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Now the <i>lettie</i> of the acts of Manasseh, and all that <i>she</i> did, and <i>her</i> <i>kertever</i> that <i>she</i> <i>kertervered</i>, are they not <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the chronicles of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Judah?
    </li>
    <li>And Manasseh <i>lettied</i> with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>, and was buried in the garden of <i>her</i> own <i>lattie</i>, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> reigned in <i>her</i> stead.
    </li>
    <li>Amon was <i>dewey dacha</i> and <i>dewey</i> years <i>badge</i> when <i>she</i> began to reign, and <i>she</i> reigned <i>dewey</i> years in Jerusalem. And <i>her</i> mother&#8217;s name was Meshullemeth, the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Haruz of Jotbah.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> did that which was <i>nana</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, as <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> Manasseh did.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>minced</i> in all the way that <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> <i>minced</i> in, and served the idols that <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> served, and worshipped them:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> forsook the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>, and <i>minced</i> not in the way of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>serving homies</i> of Amon conspired against <i>her</i>, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i> in <i>her</i> own <i>lattie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>homies and palones</i> of the land <i>ferricadoozaed</i> all them that had conspired against <i>dowriest homie</i> Amon; and the <i>homies and palones</i> of the land made Josiah <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> in <i>her</i> stead.
    </li>
    <li>Now the <i>lettie</i> of the acts of Amon which <i>she</i> did, are they not <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the chronicles of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Judah?
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> was buried in <i>her</i> sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> reigned in <i>her</i> stead.

    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> did that which was <i>sweet</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>minced</i> in all the way of <i>Davina</i> <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, and turned not aside to the <i>sweet martini</i> or to the <i>dry</i>.

    <li><i>Any road up</i> in the eighteenth year of <i>dowriest homie</i> Josiah, that the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>laued</i> Shaphan the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Azaliah, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Meshullam, the scribe, to the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>cackling</i>,

    <li>Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the <i>dinarly</i> that was <i>laued</i> into their <i>famble</i>, because they dealt <i>fabulously</i>.

    <li>And Hilkiah the high <i>godly homie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the <i>glossy</i> of the law in the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>. And Hilkiah <i>parkered</i> the <i>glossy</i> to Shaphan, and <i>she</i> <i>varda the lavs</i> it.

    <li>And Shaphan the scribe shewed the <i>dowriest homie</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Hilkiah the <i>godly homie</i> hath <i>laued</i> me a <i>glossy</i>. And Shaphan <i>varda the lavs</i> it before the <i>dowriest homie</i>.

    <li><i>Troll</i> ye, enquire of the <i>Duchess</i> for me, and for the <i>homies and palones</i>, and for all Judah, concerning the <i>lavs</i> of this <i>glossy</i> that is found: for <i>dowry</i> is the wrath of the <i>Duchess</i> that is kindled against us, because our <i>aunties</i> have not <i>aunt nelled</i> unto the <i>lavs</i> of this <i>glossy</i>, to do according unto all that which is <i>screeved</i> concerning us.

    <li>But to the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah which <i>laued</i> you to enquire of the <i>Duchess</i>, thus shall ye <i>cackle</i> to <i>her</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Israel, As <i>reefing</i> the <i>lavs</i> which thou hast <i>aunt nelled</i>;

    <li>And <i>she</i> brought out the grove from the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, <i>nanti</i> Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and stamped it <i>pogey</i> to powder, and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the <i>chavvies</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> brake down the <i>latties</i> of the <i>homie palones</i>, that were by the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, where the <i>palones</i> wove hangings for the grove.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> brought all the <i>godly homies</i> out of the <i>smokes</i> of Judah, and defiled the high places where the <i>godly homies</i> had burned <i>smelly</i>, from Geba to Beersheba, and brake down the high places of the gates that were in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the <i>smoke</i>, which were on a <i>homie</i>&#8216;s <i>dry martini</i> at the gate of the <i>smoke</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> the <i>godly homies</i> of the high places <i>trolled</i> not up to the <i>grovelling fakement</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> in Jerusalem, but they did <i>jarry</i> of the unleavened <i>pannan</i> among their <i>sisters</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the <i>chavvies</i> of Hinnom, that no <i>homie</i> might make <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> or <i>her</i> <i>palone chavvie</i> to pass through the <i>binco fakement</i> to Molech.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> away the horses that the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Judah had <i>parkered</i> to the sun, at the entering in of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, by the <i>booth</i> of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, and burned the <i>rattling coves</i> of the sun with <i>binco fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the altars that were on the top of the upper <i>booth</i> of Ahaz, which the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the <i>dewey</i> courts of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, did the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>zsa zsa-ed</i> down, and brake them down from thence, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.
    </li>
    <li>And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the <i>sweet martini</i> of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the <i>dowry cod</i> of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the <i>dowry cod</i> of the Moabites, and for Milcom the <i>dowry cod</i> of the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon, did the <i>dowriest homie</i> defile.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and filled their places with the bones of <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover the <i>grovelling fakement</i> that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nebat, who made Israel to <i>kertever</i>, had made, both that <i>grovelling fakement</i> and the high place <i>she</i> brake down, and burned the high place, and stamped it <i>pogey</i> to powder, and burned the grove.
    </li>
    <li>And as Josiah turned himself, <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> the sepulchres that were there in the mount, and <i>laued</i>, and <i>lelled</i> the bones out of the sepulchres, and burned them upon the <i>grovelling fakement</i>, and <i>dingy</i> it, according to the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> which the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> proclaimed, who proclaimed these <i>lavs</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Then <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, What title is that that I <i>varda</i>? And the <i>homies</i> of the <i>smoke</i> <i>cackled</i> <i>her</i>, It is the sepulchre of the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, which <i>trolled</i> from Judah, and proclaimed these <i>fakements</i> that thou hast done against the <i>grovelling fakement</i> of Bethel.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Let <i>her</i> alone; let no <i>homie</i> <i>troll</i> <i>her</i> bones. So they let <i>her</i> bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that <i>trolled</i> out of Samaria.
    </li>
    <li>And all the <i>latties</i> also of the high places that were in the <i>smokes</i> of Samaria, which the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Israel had made to provoke the <i>Duchess</i> to <i>wild</i>, Josiah <i>lelled</i> away, and did to them according to all the acts that <i>she</i> had done in Bethel.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>ferricadoozaed</i> all the <i>godly homies</i> of the high places that were there upon the altars, and burned <i>homies</i>&#8216;s bones upon them, and <i>trolled back to</i> Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> commanded all the <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Keep the <i>trollover</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i> your <i>Gloria</i>, as it is <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of this covenant.
    </li>
    <li>Surely there was not holden such a <i>trollover</i> from the days of the <i>beaks</i> that judged Israel, <i>nishta</i> in all the days of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Israel, <i>nishta</i> of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Judah;
    </li>
    <li>But in the eighteenth year of <i>dowriest homie</i> Josiah, wherein this <i>trollover</i> was holden to the <i>Duchess</i> in Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>Moreover the workers with familiar <i>fairies</i>, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and all the <i>dowry cods</i> that were <i>vardad</i> in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that <i>she</i> might perform the <i>lavs</i> of the law which were <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> that Hilkiah the <i>godly homie</i> found in the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And like unto <i>her</i> was there no <i>dowriest homie</i> before <i>her</i>, that turned to the <i>Duchess</i> with all <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>, and with all <i>her</i> <i>nishta lucoddy</i>, and with all <i>her</i> might, according to all the law of <i>Maureen</i>; <i>nishta</i> after <i>her</i> arose there any like <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Notwithstanding the <i>Duchess</i> turned not from the fierceness of <i>her</i> <i>dowry</i> wrath, wherewith <i>her</i> <i>wild</i> was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked <i>her</i> withal.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i>, I will remove Judah also out of my <i>vardaing</i>, as I have removed Israel, and will cast off this <i>smoke</i> Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the <i>lattie</i> of which I <i>cackled</i>, My name shall be there.
    </li>
    <li>Now the <i>lettie</i> of the acts of Josiah, and all that <i>she</i> did, are they not <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the chronicles of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Judah?
    </li>
    <li>In <i>her</i> days Pharaohnechoh <i>dowriest homie</i> of Egypt <i>trolled</i> up against the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and <i>dowriest homie</i> Josiah <i>trolled</i> against <i>her</i>; and <i>she</i> <i>ferricadoozaed</i> <i>her</i> at Megiddo, when <i>she</i> had <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i> <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> in a <i>trundling cheat</i> <i>stiff</i> from Megiddo, and brought <i>her</i> to Jerusalem, and buried <i>her</i> in <i>her</i> own sepulchre. And the <i>homies and palones</i> of the land <i>lelled</i> Jehoahaz the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Josiah, and anointed <i>her</i>, and made <i>her</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> in <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s stead.
    </li>
    <li>Jehoahaz was <i>dewey dacha</i> and <i>trey</i> years <i>badge</i> when <i>she</i> began to reign; and <i>she</i> reigned <i>trey</i> months in Jerusalem. And <i>her</i> mother&#8217;s name was Hamutal, the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Jeremiah of Libnah.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> did that which was <i>nana</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, according to all that <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i> had done.
    </li>
    <li>And Pharaohnechoh put <i>her</i> in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that <i>she</i> might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of an <i>chenter</i> talents of silver, and a talent of <i>gelt</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Josiah <i>dowriest homie</i> in the room of Josiah <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, and turned <i>her</i> name to Jehoiakim, and <i>lelled</i> Jehoahaz away: and <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> to Egypt, and <i>carked it</i> there.
    </li>
    <li>And Jehoiakim <i>parkered</i> the silver and the <i>gelt</i> to Pharaoh; but <i>she</i> taxed the land to <i>parker</i> the <i>dinarly</i> according to the <i>butch lav</i> of Pharaoh: <i>she</i> exacted the silver and the <i>gelt</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i> of the land, of every <i>una</i> according to <i>her</i> taxation, to <i>parker</i> it unto Pharaohnechoh.
    </li>
    <li>Jehoiakim was <i>dewey dacha</i> and <i>chinker</i> years <i>badge</i> when <i>she</i> began to reign; and <i>she</i> reigned <i>long dedger</i> years in Jerusalem. And <i>her</i> mother&#8217;s name was Zebudah, the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Pedaiah of Rumah.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> did that which was <i>nana</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, according to all that <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i> had done.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 24</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>In <i>her</i> days Nebuchadnezzar <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon <i>trolled</i> up, and Jehoiakim became <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i> <i>trey</i> years: then <i>she</i> turned and rebelled against <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>laued</i> against <i>her</i> bands of the Chaldees, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon, and <i>laued</i> them against Judah to <i>battyfang</i> it, according to the <i>lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, which <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> by <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i> the prophets.
    </li>
    <li>Surely at the <i>butch lav</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> this upon Judah, to remove them out of <i>her</i> <i>vardaing</i>, for the <i>kertervers</i> of Manasseh, according to all that <i>she</i> did;
    </li>
    <li>And also for the innocent blood that <i>she</i> shed: for <i>she</i> filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the <i>Duchess</i> would not pardon.
    </li>
    <li>Now the <i>lettie</i> of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that <i>she</i> did, are they not <i>screeved</i> in the <i>glossy</i> of the chronicles of the <i>dowriest homies</i> of Judah?
    </li>
    <li>So Jehoiakim <i>lettied</i> with <i>her</i> <i>aunties</i>: and Jehoiachin <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> reigned in <i>her</i> stead.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Egypt <i>trolled</i> not again any more out of <i>her</i> land: for the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon had <i>lelled</i> from the river of Egypt unto the river Euphrates all that pertained to the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Egypt.
    </li>
    <li>Jehoiachin was eighteen years <i>badge</i> when <i>she</i> began to reign, and <i>she</i> reigned in Jerusalem <i>trey</i> months. And <i>her</i> mother&#8217;s name was Nehushta, the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Elnathan of Jerusalem.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> did that which was <i>nana</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, according to all that <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> had done.
    </li>
    <li>At that time the <i>serving homies</i> of Nebuchadnezzar <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon <i>trolled</i> up against Jerusalem, and the <i>smoke</i> was besieged.
    </li>
    <li>And Nebuchadnezzar <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon <i>trolled</i> against the <i>smoke</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i> did besiege it.
    </li>
    <li>And Jehoiachin the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah <i>trolled</i> out to the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon, <i>she</i>, and <i>her</i> mother, and <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>princesses</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>hilda handcuffs</i>: and the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> in the <i>otterth</i> year of <i>her</i> reign.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> out thence all the <i>gelt</i> of the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and the <i>gelt</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, and cut in pieces all the <i>fakements</i> of <i>gelt</i> which Solomon <i>dowriest homie</i> of Israel had made in the <i>holy carsey</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, as the <i>Duchess</i> had <i>cackled</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> away all Jerusalem, and all the <i>princesses</i>, and all the <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i> of valour, even <i>dacha</i> <i>mille</i> captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the <i>homies and palones</i> of the land.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s mother, and the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>palone affairs</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>hilda handcuffs</i>, and the <i>dowry butch</i> of the land, those <i>lelled</i> <i>she</i> into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.
    </li>
    <li>And all the <i>homies</i> of might, even <i>setter</i> <i>mille</i>, and craftsmen and smiths a <i>mille</i>, all that were <i>butch</i> and apt for <i>barney</i>, even them the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon made Mattaniah <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s <i>sister</i> <i>dowriest homie</i> in <i>her</i> stead, and changed <i>her</i> name to Zedekiah.
    </li>
    <li>Zedekiah was <i>dewey dacha</i> and <i>una</i> years <i>badge</i> when <i>she</i> began to reign, and <i>she</i> reigned <i>long dedger</i> years in Jerusalem. And <i>her</i> mother&#8217;s name was Hamutal, the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Jeremiah of Libnah.
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> did that which was <i>nana</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
    </li>
    <li>For through the <i>wild</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> it <i>trolled</i> to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until <i>she</i> had cast them out from <i>her</i> presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 25</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> in the ninth year of <i>her</i> reign, in the <i>dachath</i> month, in the <i>dachath</i> <i>journo</i> of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon <i>trolled</i>, <i>she</i>, and all <i>her</i> host, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it; and they built forts against it round about.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>smoke</i> was besieged unto the eleventh year of <i>dowriest homie</i> Zedekiah.
    </li>
    <li>And on the ninth <i>journo</i> of the <i>quarter</i> month the <i>nix munjarlee</i> prevailed in the <i>smoke</i>, and there was no <i>pannan</i> for the <i>homies and palones</i> of the land.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>smoke</i> was broken up, and all the <i>homies</i> of <i>barney</i> fled by <i>nochy</i> by the way of the gate between <i>dewey</i> walls, which is by the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s garden: (now the Chaldees were against the <i>smoke</i> round about:) and the <i>dowriest homie</i> <i>trolled</i> the way toward the plain.
    </li>
    <li>And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and overtook <i>her</i> in the plains of Jericho: and all <i>her</i> army were scattered from <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>So they <i>lelled</i> the <i>dowriest homie</i>, and brought <i>her</i> up to the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon to Riblah; and they <i>parkered</i> judgment upon <i>her</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And they <i>ferricadoozaed</i> the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Zedekiah before <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i>, and put out the <i>ogles</i> of Zedekiah, and bound <i>her</i> with fetters of brass, and <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> to Babylon.
    </li>
    <li>And in the fifth month, on the <i>setterth</i> <i>journo</i> of the month, which is the nineteenth year of <i>dowriest homie</i> Nebuchadnezzar <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon, <i>trolled</i> Nebuzaradan, captain of the <i>charpering homie</i>, a <i>serving homie</i> of the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon, unto Jerusalem:
    </li>
    <li>And <i>she</i> burnt the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, and all the <i>latties</i> of Jerusalem, and every <i>dowry</i> <i>homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i> burnt <i>she</i> with <i>binco fakement</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain of the <i>charpering homie</i>, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about.
    </li>
    <li>Now the <i>lettie</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i> that were <i>dry</i> in the <i>smoke</i>, and the <i>gajos</i> that fell away to the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon, with the remnant of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the <i>charpering homie</i> carry away.
    </li>
    <li>But the captain of the <i>charpering homie</i> <i>dry</i> of the door of the <i>nanti dinarly</i> of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.
    </li>
    <li>And the pillars of brass that were in the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and <i>lelled</i> the brass of them to Babylon.
    </li>
    <li>And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the <i>fakements</i> of brass wherewith they ministered, <i>lelled</i> they away.
    </li>
    <li>And the firepans, and the bowls, and such <i>fakements</i> as were of <i>gelt</i>, in <i>gelt</i>, and of silver, in silver, the captain of the <i>charpering homie</i> <i>lelled</i> away.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>dewey</i> pillars, <i>una</i> sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the <i>lattie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>; the brass of all these <i>fakements</i> was <i>nanti</i> weight.
    </li>
    <li>The height of the <i>una</i> pillar was eighteen cubits, and the chapiter upon it was brass: and the height of the chapiter <i>trey</i> cubits; and the wreathen <i>acting dickey</i>, and pomegranates upon the chapiter round about, all of brass: and like unto these had the second pillar with wreathen <i>acting dickey</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the captain of the <i>charpering homie</i> <i>lelled</i> Seraiah the <i>dowriest</i> <i>godly homie</i>, and Zephaniah the second <i>godly homie</i>, and the <i>trey</i> keepers of the door:
    </li>
    <li>And out of the <i>smoke</i> <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> an officer that was set over the <i>homies</i> of <i>barney</i>, and <i>chinker</i> <i>homies</i> of them that were in the <i>dowriest homie</i>&#8216;s presence, which were found in the <i>smoke</i>, and the principal scribe of the host, which mustered the <i>homies and palones</i> of the land, and <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> <i>homies</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i> of the land that were found in the <i>smoke</i>:
    </li>
    <li>And Nebuzaradan captain of the <i>charpering homie</i> <i>lelled</i> these, and brought them to the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon to Riblah:
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon <i>slapped</i> them, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was <i>lelled</i> away out of their land.
    </li>
    <li>And as for the <i>homies and palones</i> that remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon had <i>dry</i>, even over them <i>she</i> made Gedaliah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Ahikam, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Shaphan, ruler.
    </li>
    <li>And when all the captains of the armies, they and their <i>homies</i>, <i>aunt nelled</i> that the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there <i>trolled</i> to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nethaniah, and Johanan the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Careah, and Seraiah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the <i>homie chavvie</i> of a Maachathite, they and their <i>homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And Gedaliah sware to them, and to their <i>homies</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto them, Fear not to be the <i>serving homies</i> of the Chaldees: <i>lett</i> in the land, and serve the <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon; and it shall be well with you.
    </li>
    <li>But it <i>trolled</i> to pass in the <i>setterth</i> month, that Ishmael the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nethaniah, the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Elishama, of the <i>maria</i> royal, <i>trolled</i>, and <i>dacha</i> <i>homies</i> with <i>her</i>, and <i>slapped</i> Gedaliah, that <i>she</i> <i>carked it</i>, and the <i>kosher homies</i> and the Chaldees that were with <i>her</i> at Mizpah.
    </li>
    <li>And all the <i>homies and palones</i>, both <i>pogey</i> and <i>dowry</i>, and the captains of the armies, arose, and <i>trolled</i> to Egypt: for they were afraid of the Chaldees.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> in the <i>setter</i> and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the <i>setter</i> and <i>dewey dachath</i> <i>journo</i> of the month, that Evilmerodach <i>dowriest homie</i> of Babylon in the year that <i>she</i> began to reign did lift up the <i>eke</i> of Jehoiachin <i>dowriest homie</i> of Judah out of <i>charpering carsey</i>;
