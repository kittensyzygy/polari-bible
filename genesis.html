    <h1>Genesis</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<ol>
<li>In the beginning <i>Gloria</i> created the heaven and the earth.
</li>
<li>And the earth was <i>nanti</i> form, and void; and <i>munge</i> was upon the <i>eke</i> of the deep. And the <i>Fairy</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>trolled</i> upon the <i>eke</i> of the <i>aquas</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i>, Let there be <i>sparkle</i>: and there was <i>sparkle</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>vardad</i> the <i>sparkle</i>, that it was <i>bona</i>: and <i>Gloria</i> <i>medzered</i> the <i>sparkle</i> from the <i>munge</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>screeched</i> the <i>sparkle</i> <i>journo</i>, and the <i>munge</i> <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> <i>nochy</i>. And the <i>bijou nochy</i> and the morning were the first <i>journo</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i>, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the <i>aquas</i>, and let it divide the <i>aquas</i> from the <i>aquas</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> made the firmament, and <i>medzered</i> the <i>aquas</i> which were under the firmament from the <i>aquas</i> which were above the firmament: and it was so.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>screeched</i> the firmament Heaven. And the <i>bijou nochy</i> and the morning were the second <i>journo</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i>, Let the <i>aquas</i> under the heaven be gathered together unto <i>una</i> place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>screeched</i> the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the <i>aquas</i> <i>screeched</i> <i>she</i> Seas: and <i>Gloria</i> <i>vardad</i> that it was <i>bona</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i>, Let the earth <i>parker</i> forth grass, the herb yielding <i>maria</i>, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after <i>her</i> kind, whose <i>maria</i> is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
</li>
<li>And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding <i>maria</i> after <i>her</i> kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose <i>maria</i> was in itself, after <i>her</i> kind: and <i>Gloria</i> <i>vardad</i> that it was <i>bona</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>bijou nochy</i> and the morning were the third <i>journo</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i>, Let there be <i>sparkles</i> in the firmament of the heaven to divide the <i>journo</i> from the <i>nochy</i>; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
</li>
<li>And let them be for <i>sparkles</i> in the firmament of the heaven to <i>parker</i> <i>sparkle</i> upon the earth: and it was so.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> made <i>dewey</i> <i>dowry</i> <i>sparkles</i>; the <i>dowrier</i> <i>sparkle</i> to rule the <i>journo</i>, and the <i>nanti dowrier</i> <i>sparkle</i> to rule the <i>nochy</i>: <i>she</i> made the <i>twinkling fakements</i> also.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> set them in the firmament of the heaven to <i>parker</i> <i>sparkle</i> upon the earth,
</li>
<li>And to rule over the <i>journo</i> and over the <i>nochy</i>, and to divide the <i>sparkle</i> from the <i>munge</i>: and <i>Gloria</i> <i>vardad</i> that it was <i>bona</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>bijou nochy</i> and the morning were the <i>quarter</i> <i>journo</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i>, Let the <i>aquas</i> <i>parker</i> forth <i>dowrily</i> the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> created <i>dowry</i> whales, and every living creature that <i>trolleth</i>, which the <i>aquas</i> brought forth <i>dowrily</i>, after their kind, and every winged fowl after <i>her</i> kind: and <i>Gloria</i> <i>vardad</i> that it was <i>bona</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>fabed</i> them, <i>cackling</i>, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the <i>aquas</i> in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
</li>
<li>And the <i>bijou nochy</i> and the morning were the fifth <i>journo</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i>, Let the earth <i>parker</i> forth the living creature after <i>her</i> kind, cattle, and creeping <i>fakement</i>, and beast of the earth after <i>her</i> kind: and it was so.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> made the beast of the earth after <i>her</i> kind, and cattle after their kind, and every <i>fakement</i> that creepeth upon the earth after <i>her</i> kind: and <i>Gloria</i> <i>vardad</i> that it was <i>bona</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i>, Let us make <i>homie</i> in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping <i>fakement</i> that creepeth upon the earth.
</li>
<li>So <i>Gloria</i> created <i>homie</i> in <i>her</i> own image, in the image of <i>Gloria</i> created <i>she</i> <i>her</i>; <i>omee</i> and <i>palone</i> created <i>she</i> them.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>fabed</i> them, and <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living <i>fakement</i> that <i>trolleth</i> upon the earth.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, I have <i>parkered</i> you every herb bearing <i>maria</i>, which is upon the <i>eke</i> of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding <i>maria</i>; to you it shall be for <i>carnish</i>.
</li>
<li>And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every <i>fakement</i> that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have <i>parkered</i> every green herb for <i>carnish</i>: and it was so.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>vardad</i> every <i>fakement</i> that <i>she</i> had made, and, <i>varda</i>, it was <i>dowry</i> <i>bona</i>. And the <i>bijou nochy</i> and the morning were the <i>seyth</i> <i>journo</i>.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<ol>
<li>Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
</li>
<li>And on the <i>setterth</i> <i>journo</i> <i>Gloria</i> ended <i>her</i> <i>acting dickey</i> which <i>she</i> had made; and <i>she</i> rested on the <i>setterth</i> <i>journo</i> from all <i>her</i> <i>acting dickey</i> which <i>she</i> had made.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>fabed</i> the <i>setterth</i> <i>journo</i>, and sanctified it: because that in it <i>she</i> had rested from all <i>her</i> <i>acting dickey</i> which <i>Gloria</i> created and made.
</li>
<li>These are the <i>chavvies</i> of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the <i>journo</i> that the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> made the earth and the heavens,
</li>
<li>And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a <i>homie</i> to till the ground.
</li>
<li>But there <i>trolled</i> up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole <i>eke</i> of the ground.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> formed <i>homie</i> of the dust of the ground, and breathed into <i>her</i> <i>bugle</i> the breath of life; and <i>homie</i> became a living <i>nishta lucoddy</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there <i>she</i> put the <i>homie</i> whom <i>she</i> had formed.
</li>
<li>And out of the ground made the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> to grow every tree that is <i>dolly</i> to the <i>vardaing</i>, and <i>bona</i> for <i>manjarry</i>; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of <i>bona</i> and <i>nana</i>.
</li>
<li>And a river <i>trolled</i> out of Eden to <i>aqua</i> the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into <i>quarter</i> <i>ekes</i>.
</li>
<li>The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is <i>gelt</i>;
</li>
<li>And the <i>gelt</i> of that land is <i>bona</i>: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.
</li>
<li>And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.
</li>
<li>And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the <i>quarter</i> river is Euphrates.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> <i>lelled</i> the <i>homie</i>, and put <i>her</i> into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> commanded the <i>homie</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely <i>jarry</i>:
</li>
<li>But of the tree of the knowledge of <i>bona</i> and <i>nana</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>jarry</i> of it: for in the <i>journo</i> that thou <i>jarriest</i> thereof thou shalt surely <i>cark it</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i>, It is not <i>bona</i> that the <i>homie</i> should be alone; I will make <i>her</i> an help meet for <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And out of the ground the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to <i>varda</i> what <i>she</i> would <i>screech</i> them: and whatsoever Adam <i>screeched</i> every living creature, that was the name thereof.
</li>
<li>And Adam <i>parkered</i> names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> caused a deep <i>letty</i> to fall upon Adam, and <i>she</i> <i>lettied</i>: and <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> <i>una</i> of <i>her</i> ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;
</li>
<li>And the rib, which the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> had <i>lelled</i> from <i>homie</i>, made <i>she</i> a <i>palone</i>, and brought her unto the <i>homie</i>.
</li>
<li>And Adam <i>cackled</i>, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be <i>screeched</i> <i>palone</i>, because she was <i>lelled</i> out of <i>homie</i>.
</li>
<li>Therefore shall a <i>homie</i> leave <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> and <i>her</i> mother, and shall cleave unto <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>: and they shall be <i>una</i> flesh.
</li>
<li>And they were both <i>nanti zhoosh</i>, the <i>homie</i> and <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>, and were not ashamed.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<ol>
<li>Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> had made. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>palone</i>, <i>any road up</i>, hath <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>nanti</i> <i>jarry</i> of every tree of the garden?
</li>
<li>And the <i>palone</i> <i>cackled</i> unto the serpent, We may <i>jarry</i> of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
</li>
<li>But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>cackled</i>, <i>nanti</i> <i>jarry</i> of it, <i>nishta</i> shall ye <i>reef</i> it, lest ye <i>cark it</i>.
</li>
<li>And the serpent <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>palone</i>, <i>nanti</i> surely <i>cark it</i>:
</li>
<li>For <i>Gloria</i> doth know that in the <i>journo</i> ye <i>jarry</i> thereof, then your <i>ogles</i> shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing <i>bona</i> and <i>nana</i>.
</li>
<li>And when the <i>palone</i> <i>vardad</i> that the tree was <i>bona</i> for <i>manjarry</i>, and that it was <i>dolly</i> to the <i>ogles</i>, and a tree to be <i>fancied</i> to make <i>una</i> wise, she <i>lelled</i> of the fruit thereof, and did <i>jarry</i>, and <i>parkered</i> also unto her <i>homie affair</i> with her; and <i>she</i> did <i>jarry</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>ogles</i> of them both were opened, and they knew that they were <i>nanti zhoosh</i>; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves <i>frocks</i>.
</li>
<li>And they <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>cackling fakement</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> <i>mincing</i> in the garden in the cool of the <i>journo</i>: and Adam and <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i> hid themselves from the presence of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> amongst the trees of the garden.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> <i>screeched</i> unto Adam, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Where art thou?
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, I <i>aunt nelled</i> thy <i>cackling fakement</i> in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was <i>nanti zhoosh</i>; and I hid myself.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Who <i>cackled</i> thee that thou wast <i>nanti zhoosh</i>? Hast thou <i>jarried</i> of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not <i>jarry</i>?
</li>
<li>And the <i>homie</i> <i>cackled</i>, The <i>palone</i> whom thou gavest to be with me, she <i>parkered</i> me of the tree, and I did <i>jarry</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>palone</i>, What is this that thou hast done? And the <i>palone</i> <i>cackled</i>, The serpent beguiled me, and I did <i>jarry</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i> unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou <i>troll</i>, and dust shalt thou <i>jarry</i> all the days of thy life:
</li>
<li>And I will put enmity between thee and the <i>palone</i>, and between thy <i>maria</i> and her <i>maria</i>; it shall bruise thy <i>eke</i>, and thou shalt bruise <i>her</i> heel.
</li>
<li>Unto the <i>palone</i> <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, I will greatly multiply thy <i>sharda</i> and thy conception; in <i>sharda</i> thou shalt <i>parker</i> forth <i>chavvies</i>; and thy <i>fancy</i> shall be to thy <i>homie affair</i>, and <i>she</i> shall rule over thee.
</li>
<li>And unto Adam <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Because thou hast <i>aunt nelled</i> unto the <i>cackling fakement</i> of thy <i>palone affair</i>, and hast <i>jarried</i> of the tree, of which I commanded thee, <i>cackling</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>jarry</i> of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in <i>sharda</i> shalt thou <i>jarry</i> of it all the days of thy life;
</li>
<li>Thorns also and thistles shall it <i>parker</i> forth to thee; and thou shalt <i>jarry</i> the herb of the field;
</li>
<li>In the sweat of thy <i>eke</i> shalt thou <i>jarry</i> <i>pannan</i>, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou <i>lelled</i>: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
</li>
<li>And Adam <i>screeched</i> <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>&#8216;s name <i>Steve</i>; because she was the mother of all living.
</li>
<li>Unto Adam also and to <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i> did the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> make coats of skins, and clothed them.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, the <i>homie</i> is become as <i>una</i> of us, to know <i>bona</i> and <i>nana</i>: and now, lest <i>she</i> put forth <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>, and <i>lell</i> also of the tree of life, and <i>jarry</i>, and live for ever:
</li>
<li>Therefore the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence <i>she</i> was <i>lelled</i>.
</li>
<li>So <i>she</i> drove out the <i>homie</i>; and <i>she</i> placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming <i>dowry efink</i> which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<ol>
<li>And Adam knew <i>Steve</i> <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and <i>cackled</i>, I have gotten a <i>homie</i> from the <i>Duchess</i>.
</li>
<li>And she again bare <i>her</i> <i>sister</i> Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
</li>
<li>And in process of time it <i>trolled</i> to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an <i>parkering</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>.
</li>
<li>And Abel, <i>she</i> also brought of the firstlings of <i>her</i> flock and of the fat thereof. And the <i>Duchess</i> had respect unto Abel and to <i>her</i> <i>parkering</i>:
</li>
<li>But unto Cain and to <i>her</i> <i>parkering</i> <i>she</i> had not respect. And Cain was <i>dowry</i> <i>dander</i>, and <i>her</i> countenance fell.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Cain, Why art thou <i>dander</i>? and why is thy countenance fallen?
</li>
<li>If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, <i>kertever</i> <i>lettieth</i> at the door. And unto thee shall be <i>her</i> <i>fancy</i>, and thou shalt rule over <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And Cain talked with Abel <i>her</i> <i>sister</i>: <i>any road up</i>, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel <i>her</i> <i>sister</i>, and <i>ferricadoozaed</i> <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Cain, Where is Abel thy <i>sister</i>? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, I know not: Am I my <i>sister</i>&#8216;s keeper?
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, What hast thou done? the <i>cackling fakement</i> of thy <i>sister</i>&#8216;s blood <i>screecheth</i> unto me from the ground.
</li>
<li>And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her <i>screech</i> to <i>lall</i> thy <i>sister</i>&#8216;s blood from thy <i>famble</i>;
</li>
<li>When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her <i>butchness</i>; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
</li>
<li>And Cain <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>, My <i>zsa zsa-ing</i> is <i>dowrier</i> than I can bear.
</li>
<li><i>Varda</i>, thou hast driven me out this <i>journo</i> from the <i>eke</i> of the earth; and from thy <i>eke</i> shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, that every <i>una</i> that findeth me shall <i>ferricadooza</i> me.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Therefore whosoever <i>ferricadoozeth</i> Cain, <i>the rights</i> shall be <i>lelled</i> on <i>her</i> <i>setterfold</i>. And the <i>Duchess</i> set a <i>Marcia</i> upon Cain, lest any finding <i>her</i> should <i>ferricadoza</i> <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And Cain <i>trolled</i> out from the presence of the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>letted</i> in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.
</li>
<li>And Cain knew <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and <i>she</i> builded a <i>smoke</i>, and <i>screeched</i> the name of the <i>smoke</i>, after the name of <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>, Enoch.
</li>
<li>And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad <i>chavvied</i> Mehujael: and Mehujael <i>chavvied</i> Methusael: and Methusael <i>chavvied</i> Lamech.
</li>
<li>And Lamech <i>lelled</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>dewey</i> <i>palone affairs</i>: the name of the <i>una</i> was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
</li>
<li>And Adah bare Jabal: <i>she</i> was the <i>Auntie</i> of such as <i>lett</i> in <i>trolling letties</i>, and of such as have cattle.
</li>
<li>And <i>her</i> <i>sister</i>&#8216;s name was Jubal: <i>she</i> was the <i>Auntie</i> of all such as handle the harp and organ.
</li>
<li>And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.
</li>
<li>And Lamech <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>palone affairs</i>, Adah and Zillah, <i>aunt nell</i> my <i>cackling fakement</i>; ye <i>palone affairs</i> of Lamech, <i>aunt nell</i> unto my <i>cackle</i>: for I have <i>ferricadoozed</i> a <i>homie</i> to my wounding, and a <i>bean cove</i> to my hurt.
</li>
<li>If Cain shall be avenged <i>setterfold</i>, truly Lamech <i>setter dacha</i> and <i>setterfold</i>.
</li>
<li>And Adam knew <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i> again; and she bare a <i>homie chavvie</i>, and <i>screeched</i> <i>her</i> name Seth: For <i>Gloria</i>, <i>cackled</i> she, hath appointed me another <i>maria</i> instead of Abel, whom Cain <i>ferricadoozaed</i>.
</li>
<li>And to Seth, to <i>her</i> also there was born a <i>homie chavvie</i>; and <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> <i>her</i> name Enos: then began <i>homies</i> to <i>screech</i> upon the name of the <i>Duchess</i>.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
<ol>

</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i>, My <i>Fairy</i> shall not always strive with <i>homie</i>, for that <i>she</i> also is flesh: yet <i>her</i> days shall be an <i>chenter</i> and <i>dewey dacha</i> years.
</li>
<li>There were <i>big butch homies</i> in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the <i>homie chavvies</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>trolled</i> in unto the <i>palone chavvies</i> of <i>homies</i>, and they bare <i>chavvies</i> to them, the same became <i>dowry butch</i> <i>homies</i> which were of <i>badge</i>, <i>homies</i> of renown.

<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>vardad</i> that the <i>naffness</i> of <i>homie</i> was <i>dowry</i> in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i> was only <i>nana</i> continually.
</li>
<li>And it repented the <i>Duchess</i> that <i>she</i> had made <i>homie</i> on the earth, and it grieved <i>her</i> at <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>.

<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i>, I will <i>battyfang</i> <i>homie</i> whom I have created from the <i>eke</i> of the earth; both <i>homie</i>, and beast, and the creeping <i>fakement</i>, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
</li>
<li>But <i>Norah</i> found <i>gracie</i> in the <i>ogles</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
</li>
<li>These are the <i>chavvies</i> of <i>Norah</i>: <i>Norah</i> was a just <i>homie</i> and <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i> in <i>her</i> <i>chavvies</i>, and <i>Norah</i> <i>minced</i> with <i>Gloria</i>.

<li>And <i>Norah</i> <i>chavvied</i> <i>trey</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
</li>
<li>The earth also was corrupt before <i>Gloria</i>, and the earth was filled with <i>slapping</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> looked upon the earth, and, <i>varda</i>, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted <i>her</i> way upon the earth.

<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Norah</i>, The end of all flesh is <i>troll</i> before me; for the earth is filled with <i>slapping</i> through them; and, <i>varda</i>, I will <i>battyfang</i> them with the earth.
</li>
<li>Make thee an <i>bijou arkette</i> of gopher wood; <i>letties</i> shalt thou make in the <i>bijou arkette</i>, and shalt pitch it within and <i>nanti</i> with pitch.
</li>
<li>And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the <i>bijou arkette</i> shall be <i>trey</i> <i>chenter</i> cubits, the breadth of it <i>chinker dacha</i> cubits, and the height of it <i>trey dacha</i> cubits.

<li>A window shalt thou make to the <i>bijou arkette</i>, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the <i>bijou arkette</i> shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
</li>
<li>And, <i>varda</i>, I, even I, do <i>parker</i> a <i>dowry aqua</i> of <i>aquas</i> upon the earth, to <i>battyfang</i> all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every <i>fakement</i> that is in the earth shall <i>cark it</i>.
</li>
<li>But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt <i>troll</i> into the <i>bijou arkette</i>, thou, and thy <i>homie chavvies</i>, and thy <i>palone affair</i>, and thy <i>homie chavvies</i>&#8216; <i>palone affairs</i> with thee.
</li>
<li>And of every living <i>fakement</i> of all flesh, <i>dewey</i> of every sort shalt thou <i>parker</i> into the <i>bijou arkette</i>, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be <i>omee</i> and <i>palone</i>.

<li>Now the <i>Duchess</i> had <i>cackled</i> unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, unto a land that I will shew thee:
</li>
<li>And I will make of thee a <i>dowry</i> nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name <i>dowry</i>; and thou shalt be a <i>bona lav</i>:
</li>
<li>And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse <i>her</i> that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be <i>fabed</i>.
</li>
<li>So Abram <i>trolled off</i>, as the <i>Duchess</i> had <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>; and Lot <i>trolled</i> with <i>her</i>: and Abram was <i>setter dacha</i> and <i>chinker</i> years <i>badge</i> when <i>she</i> <i>trolled off</i> out of Haran.
</li>
<li>And Abram <i>lelled</i> Sarai <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>, and Lot <i>her</i> <i>sister</i>&#8216;s <i>homie chavvie</i>, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the <i>nishta lucoddies</i> that they had gotten in Haran; and they <i>trolled</i> forth to <i>troll</i> into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they <i>trolled</i>.
</li>
<li>And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> appeared unto Abram, and <i>cackled</i>, Unto thy <i>maria</i> will I <i>parker</i> this land: and there builded <i>she</i> an <i>grovelling fakement</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>, who appeared unto <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched <i>her</i> <i>trolling lettie</i>, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there <i>she</i> builded an <i>grovelling fakement</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>, and <i>screeched</i> upon the name of the <i>Duchess</i>.
</li>
<li>And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.
</li>
<li>And there was a <i>nix munjarlee</i> in the land: and Abram <i>trolled</i> down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the <i>nix munjarlee</i> was <i>naff</i> in the land.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i>, when <i>she</i> was <i>troll</i> near to enter into Egypt, that <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Sarai <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>, <i>varda</i> now, I know that thou art a <i>filly</i> <i>palone</i> to <i>varda</i> upon:
</li>
<li>Therefore it shall <i>troll</i> to pass, when the Egyptians shall <i>varda</i> thee, that they shall <i>cackle</i>, This is <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>: and they will <i>ferricadoza</i> me, but they will save thee alive.
</li>
<li><i>Cackle</i>, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my <i>nishta lucoddy</i> shall live because of thee.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i>, that, when Abram was <i>troll</i> into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the <i>palone</i> that she was <i>dowry</i> <i>filly</i>.
</li>
<li>The <i>princesses</i> also of Pharaoh <i>vardad</i> her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the <i>palone</i> was <i>lelled</i> into Pharaoh&#8217;s <i>lattie</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> entreated Abram well for her sake: and <i>she</i> had sheep, and oxen, and <i>she</i> asses, and <i>homieservants</i>, and <i>palone servants</i>, and she asses, and camels.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> plagued Pharaoh and <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i> with <i>dowry</i> plagues because of Sarai Abram&#8217;s <i>palone affair</i>.
</li>
<li>And Pharaoh <i>screeched</i> Abram and <i>cackled</i>, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not <i>cackle</i> me that she was thy <i>palone affair</i>?
</li>
<li>Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have <i>lelled</i> her to me to <i>palone affair</i>: now therefore <i>varda</i> thy <i>palone affair</i>, <i>lell</i> her, and <i>troll</i> thy way.
</li>
<li>And Pharaoh commanded <i>her</i> <i>homies</i> concerning <i>her</i>: and they <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> away, and <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>, and all that <i>she</i> had.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Chapter 13</h2>
<ol>
<li>And Abram <i>trolled</i> up out of Egypt, <i>she</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>, and all that <i>she</i> had, and Lot with <i>her</i>, into the south.
</li>
<li>And Abram was <i>dowry</i> rich in cattle, in silver, and in <i>gelt</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> on <i>her</i> journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where <i>her</i> <i>trolling lettie</i> had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;
</li>
<li>Unto the place of the <i>grovelling fakement</i>, which <i>she</i> had make there at the first: and there Abram <i>screeched</i> on the name of the <i>Duchess</i>.
</li>
<li>And Lot also, which <i>trolled</i> with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and <i>trolling letties</i>.
</li>
<li>And the land was not able to bear them, that they might <i>lett</i> together: for their substance was <i>dowry</i>, so that they could not <i>lett</i> together.
</li>
<li>And there was a strife between the <i>herd homies</i> of Abram&#8217;s cattle and the <i>herd homies</i> of Lot&#8217;s cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.
</li>
<li>And Abram <i>cackled</i> unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my <i>herd homies</i> and thy <i>herd homies</i>; for we be <i>sisters</i>.
</li>
<li>Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt <i>lell</i> the <i>dry martini</i>, then I will <i>troll</i> to the <i>sweet</i>; or if thou <i>troll off</i> to the <i>sweet martini</i>, then I will <i>troll</i> to the <i>dry</i>.
</li>
<li>And Lot lifted up <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i>, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the <i>Duchess</i> <i>battyfanged</i> Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the <i>Duchess</i>, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.
</li>
<li>Then Lot chose <i>her</i> all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the <i>una</i> from the other.
</li>
<li>Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the <i>smokes</i> of the plain, and pitched <i>her</i> <i>trolling lettie</i> toward Sodom.
</li>
<li>But the <i>homies</i> of Sodom were <i>naff</i> and <i>kerterverers</i> before the <i>Duchess</i> exceedingly.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from <i>her</i>, Lift up now thine <i>ogles</i>, and <i>varda</i> from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:
</li>
<li>For all the land which thou <i>vardest</i>, to thee will I <i>parker</i> it, and to thy <i>maria</i> for ever.
</li>
<li>And I will make thy <i>maria</i> as the dust of the earth: so that if a <i>homie</i> can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy <i>maria</i> also be numbered.
</li>
<li>Arise, <i>mince</i> through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will <i>parker</i> it unto thee.
</li>
<li>Then Abram removed <i>her</i> <i>trolling lettie</i>, and <i>trolled</i> and <i>letted</i> in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an <i>grovelling fakement</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>.

<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy <i>maria</i> after thee in their <i>chavvies</i>.
</li>
<li>This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy <i>maria</i> after thee; Every <i>homie</i> <i>chavvie</i> among you shall be <i>roundhead</i>.
</li>
<li>And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your <i>chaud&#8217;s mudge</i>; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> that is <i>say dooe</i> days <i>badge</i> shall be <i>roundhead</i> among you, every <i>homie</i> <i>chavvie</i> in your <i>chavvies</i>, <i>she</i> that is born in the <i>lattie</i>, or bought with <i>dinarly</i> of any stranger, which is not of thy <i>maria</i>.
</li>
<li><i>She</i> that is born in thy <i>lattie</i>, and <i>she</i> that is bought with thy <i>dinarly</i>, must needs be <i>roundhead</i>: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
</li>
<li>And the <i>cavalier</i> <i>homie</i> <i>chavvie</i> whose flesh of <i>her</i> <i>chaud&#8217;s mudge</i> is not <i>roundhead</i>, that <i>nishta lucoddy</i> shall be cut off from <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>; <i>she</i> hath broken my covenant.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy <i>palone affair</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>screech</i> her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.
</li>
<li>And I will bless her, and <i>parker</i> thee a <i>homie chavvie</i> also of her: <i>any road up</i>, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; <i>dowriest homies</i> of <i>homies and palones</i> shall be of her.
</li>
<li>Then Abraham fell upon <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>, and <i>tittered</i>, and <i>cackled</i> in <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>, Shall a <i>chavvie</i> be born unto <i>her</i> that is an <i>chenter</i> years <i>badge</i>? and shall Sarah, that is <i>nobber dacha</i> years <i>badge</i>, bear?
</li>
<li>And Abraham <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Gloria</i>, O that Ishmael might live before thee!
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i>, Sarah thy <i>palone affair</i> shall bear thee a <i>homie chavvie</i> indeed; and thou shalt <i>screech</i> <i>her</i> name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with <i>her</i> for an everlasting covenant, and with <i>her</i> <i>maria</i> after <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And as for Ishmael, I have <i>aunt nelled</i> thee: <i>varda</i>, I have <i>fabed</i> <i>her</i>, and will make <i>her</i> fruitful, and will multiply <i>her</i> exceedingly; <i>kenza</i> <i>princesses</i> shall <i>she</i> beget, and I will make <i>her</i> a <i>dowry</i> nation.
</li>
<li>But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>dry</i> off talking with <i>her</i>, and <i>Gloria</i> <i>trolled</i> up from Abraham.
</li>
<li>And Abraham <i>lelled</i> Ishmael <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>, and all that were born in <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>, and all that were bought with <i>her</i> <i>dinarly</i>, every <i>omee</i> among the <i>homies</i> of Abraham&#8217;s <i>lattie</i>; and <i>roundhead</i> the flesh of their <i>chaud&#8217;s mudge</i> in the selfsame <i>journo</i>, as <i>Gloria</i> had <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And Abraham was <i>nobber dacha</i> years <i>badge</i> and <i>sey trey</i>, when <i>she</i> was <i>roundhead</i> in the flesh of <i>her</i> <i>chaud&#8217;s mudge</i>.
</li>
<li>And Ishmael <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> was thirteen years <i>badge</i>, when <i>she</i> was <i>roundhead</i> in the flesh of <i>her</i> <i>chaud&#8217;s mudge</i>.
</li>
<li>In the selfsame <i>journo</i> was Abraham <i>roundhead</i>, and Ishmael <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>.
</li>
<li>And all the <i>homies</i> of <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>, born in the <i>lattie</i>, and bought with <i>dinarly</i> of the stranger, were <i>roundhead</i> with <i>her</i>.

<h2>Chapter 18</h2>
<ol>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> appeared unto <i>her</i> in the plains of Mamre: and <i>she</i> sat in the <i>trolling lettie</i> door in the heat of the <i>journo</i>;
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> lift up <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i> and looked, and, lo, <i>trey</i> <i>homies</i> stood by <i>her</i>: and when <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> them, <i>she</i> ran to meet them from the <i>trolling lettie</i> door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
</li>
<li>And <i>cackled</i>, My <i>Duchess</i>, if now I have found favour in thy <i>vardaing</i>, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy <i>serving homie</i>:
</li>
<li>Let a <i>bijou</i> <i>aqua</i>, I pray you, be fetched, and <i>dhobie</i> your <i>plates</i>, and <i>lettie</i> yourselves under the tree:
</li>
<li>And I will fetch a morsel of <i>pannan</i>, and comfort ye your <i>thumping cheats</i>; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye <i>troll</i> to your <i>serving homie</i>. And they <i>cackled</i>, So do, as thou hast <i>cackled</i>.
</li>
<li>And Abraham hastened into the <i>trolling lettie</i> unto Sarah, and <i>cackled</i>, Make ready quickly <i>trey</i> measures of <i>bona</i> meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.
</li>
<li>And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and <i>bona</i>, and <i>parkered</i> it unto a <i>bean cove</i>; and <i>she</i> hasted to dress it.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> butter, and milk, and the calf which <i>she</i> had <i>zhooshed</i>, and set it before them; and <i>she</i> stood by them under the tree, and they did <i>jarry</i>.
</li>
<li>And they <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Where is Sarah thy <i>palone affair</i>? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, in the <i>trolling lettie</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, I will <i>mais oui</i> return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy <i>palone affair</i> shall have a <i>homie chavvie</i>. And Sarah <i>aunt nelled</i> it in the <i>trolling lettie</i> door, which was behind <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>Now Abraham and Sarah were <i>badge</i> and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of <i>palones</i>.
</li>
<li>Therefore Sarah <i>tittered</i> within herself, <i>cackling</i>, After I am waxed <i>badge</i> shall I have pleasure, my <i>Duchess</i> being <i>badge</i> also?
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah <i>titter</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Shall I of a surety bear a <i>chavvie</i>, which am <i>badge</i>?
</li>
<li>Is any <i>fakement</i> too hard for the <i>Duchess</i>? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a <i>homie chavvie</i>.
</li>
<li>Then Sarah denied, <i>cackling</i>, I <i>tittered</i> not; for she was afraid. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Nay; but thou didst <i>titter</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>homies</i> rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham <i>trolled</i> with them to <i>parker</i> them on the way.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i>, Shall I hide from Abraham that <i>fakement</i> which I do;
</li>
<li><i>Vardaing</i> that Abraham shall surely become a <i>dowry</i> and <i>dowry butch</i> nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be <i>fabed</i> in <i>her</i>?
</li>
<li>For I know <i>her</i>, that <i>she</i> will command <i>her</i> <i>chavvies</i> and <i>her</i> household after <i>her</i>, and they shall keep the way of the <i>Duchess</i>, to do justice and judgment; that the <i>Duchess</i> may <i>parker</i> upon Abraham that which <i>she</i> hath <i>cackled</i> of <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i>, Because the <i>screech</i> of Sodom and Gomorrah is <i>dowry</i>, and because their <i>kertever</i> is <i>dowry</i> <i>naff</i>;
</li>
<li>I will <i>troll</i> down now, and <i>varda</i> whether they have done altogether according to the <i>screech</i> of it, which is <i>troll</i> unto me; and if not, I will know.
</li>
<li>And the <i>homies</i> turned their <i>ekes</i> from thence, and <i>trolled</i> toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the <i>Duchess</i>.
</li>
<li>And Abraham drew near, and <i>cackled</i>, Wilt thou also <i>battyfang</i> the <i>bona</i> with the <i>naff</i>?
</li>
<li>Peradventure there be <i>chinker dacha</i> <i>bona</i> within the <i>smoke</i>: wilt thou also <i>battyfang</i> and not spare the place for the <i>chinker dacha</i> <i>bona</i> that are therein?
</li>
<li>That be <i>nishter ajax</i> thee to do after this manner, to <i>ferricadooza</i> the <i>bona</i> with the <i>naff</i>: and that the <i>bona</i> should be as the <i>naff</i>, that be <i>nishter ajax</i> thee: Shall not the <i>beak</i> of all the earth do <i>sweet</i>?
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i>, If I find in Sodom <i>chinker dacha</i> <i>bona</i> within the <i>smoke</i>, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.
</li>
<li>And Abraham answered and <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i> now, I have <i>lelled</i> upon me to <i>cackle</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>, which am but dust and ashes:
</li>
<li>Peradventure there shall lack <i>chinker</i> of the <i>chinker dacha</i> <i>bona</i>: wilt thou <i>battyfang</i> all the <i>smoke</i> for lack of <i>chinker</i>? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, If I find there <i>quarter dacha</i> and <i>chinker</i>, I will not <i>battyfang</i> it.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> yet again, and <i>cackled</i>, Peradventure there shall be <i>quarter dacha</i> found there. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, I will not do it for <i>quarter dacha</i>&#8216;s sake.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Oh let not the <i>Duchess</i> be angry, and I will <i>cackle</i>: Peradventure there shall <i>trey dacha</i> be found there. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, I will not do it, if I find <i>trey dacha</i> there.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i> now, I have <i>lelled</i> upon me to <i>cackle</i> unto the <i>Duchess</i>: Peradventure there shall be <i>dewey dacha</i> found there. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, I will not <i>battyfang</i> it for <i>dewey dacha</i>&#8216;s sake.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Oh let not the <i>Duchess</i> be angry, and I will <i>cackle</i> yet but this once: Peradventure <i>dacha</i> shall be found there. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, I will not <i>battyfang</i> it for <i>dacha</i>&#8216;s sake.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>trolled</i> <i>her</i> way, as soon as <i>she</i> had <i>dry</i> communing with Abraham: and Abraham <i>trolled back</i> unto <i>her</i> place.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Chapter 19</h2>
<ol>
<li>And there <i>trolled</i> <i>dewey</i> <i>fairies</i> to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot <i>vardaing</i> them rose up to meet them; and <i>she</i> bowed himself with <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> toward the ground;
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i> now, my <i>ladies</i>, turn in, I pray you, into your <i>serving homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, and tarry all <i>nochy</i>, and <i>dhobie</i> your <i>plates</i>, and ye shall rise up early, and <i>troll</i> on your ways. And they <i>cackled</i>, Nay; but we will <i>lett</i> in the street all <i>nochy</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto <i>her</i>, and entered into <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>; and <i>she</i> made them a <i>dowry munjarlee</i>, and did bake unleavened <i>pannan</i>, and they did <i>jarry</i>.
</li>
<li>But before they <i>lett</i> down, the <i>homies</i> of the <i>smoke</i>, even the <i>homies</i> of Sodom, compassed the <i>lattie</i> round, both <i>badge</i> and <i>bean</i>, all the <i>homies and palones</i> from every quarter:
</li>
<li>And they <i>screeched</i> unto Lot, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Where are the <i>homies</i> which <i>trolled</i> in to thee this <i>nochy</i>? <i>parker</i> them out unto us, that we may know them.
</li>
<li>And Lot <i>trolled</i> out at the door unto them, and shut the door after <i>her</i>,
</li>
<li>And <i>cackled</i>, I pray you, <i>sisters</i>, <i>nix</i> so wickedly.
</li>
<li><i>Varda</i> now, I have <i>dewey</i> <i>palone chavvies</i> which have not known <i>homie</i>; let me, I pray you, <i>parker</i> them out unto you, and do ye to them as is <i>bona</i> in your <i>ogles</i>: only unto these <i>homies</i> do <i>nishter</i>; for therefore <i>trolled</i> they under the shadow of my roof.
</li>
<li>And they <i>cackled</i>, Stand back. And they <i>cackled</i> again, This <i>una</i> fellow <i>trolled</i> in to sojourn, and <i>she</i> will needs be a <i>beak</i>: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the <i>homie</i>, even Lot, and <i>trolled</i> near to break the door.
</li>
<li>But the <i>homies</i> put forth their <i>famble</i>, and pulled Lot into the <i>lattie</i> to them, and shut to the door.
</li>
<li>And they <i>slapped</i> the <i>homies</i> that were at the door of the <i>lattie</i> with blindness, both <i>pogey</i> and <i>dowry</i>: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
</li>
<li>And the <i>homies</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? <i>homie chavvie</i> in law, and thy <i>homie chavvies</i>, and thy <i>palone chavvies</i>, and whatsoever thou hast in the <i>smoke</i>, <i>parker</i> them out of this place:
</li>
<li>For we will <i>battyfang</i> this place, because the <i>screech</i> of them is waxen <i>dowry</i> before the <i>eke</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>; and the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>laued</i> us to <i>battyfang</i> it.
</li>
<li>And Lot <i>trolled</i> out, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> in law, which married <i>her</i> <i>palone chavvies</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Up, get you out of this place; for the <i>Duchess</i> will <i>battyfang</i> this <i>smoke</i>. But <i>she</i> seemed as <i>una</i> that mocked unto <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> in law.
</li>
<li>And when the morning arose, then the <i>fairies</i> hastened Lot, <i>cackling</i>, Arise, <i>lell</i> thy <i>palone affair</i>, and thy <i>dewey</i> <i>palone chavvies</i>, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the <i>codness</i> of the <i>smoke</i>.
</li>
<li>And while <i>she</i> lingered, the <i>homies</i> <i>laued</i> hold upon <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>, and upon the <i>famble</i> of <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>, and upon the <i>famble</i> of <i>her</i> <i>dewey</i> <i>palone chavvies</i>; the <i>Duchess</i> being merciful unto <i>her</i>: and they brought <i>her</i> forth, and set <i>her</i> <i>nanti</i> the <i>smoke</i>.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i>, when they had brought them forth abroad, that <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Escape for thy life; <i>varda</i> not behind thee, <i>nishta</i> stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
</li>
<li>And Lot <i>cackled</i> unto them, Oh, not so, my <i>Duchess</i>:
</li>
<li><i>Varda</i> now, thy <i>serving homie</i> hath found <i>gracie</i> in thy <i>vardaing</i>, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some <i>nana</i> <i>lell</i> me, and I <i>cark it</i>:
</li>
<li><i>Varda</i> now, this <i>smoke</i> is near to <i>scarper</i> unto, and it is a <i>bijou</i> <i>una</i>: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a <i>bijou</i> <i>una</i>?) and my <i>nishta lucoddy</i> shall live.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>varda</i>, I have accepted thee concerning this <i>fakement</i> also, that I will not overthrow this <i>smoke</i>, for the which thou hast <i>cackled</i>.
</li>
<li>Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou be <i>troll</i> thither. Therefore the name of the <i>smoke</i> was <i>screeched</i> Zoar.
</li>
<li>The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.
</li>
<li>Then the <i>Duchess</i> rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and <i>binco fakement</i> from the <i>Duchess</i> out of heaven;
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> overthrew those <i>smokes</i>, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the <i>smokes</i>, and that which grew upon the ground.
</li>
<li>But <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i> looked back from behind <i>her</i>, and she became a pillar of salt.
</li>
<li>And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where <i>she</i> stood before the <i>Duchess</i>:
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country <i>trolled</i> up as the smoke of a furnace.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i>, when <i>Gloria</i> <i>battyfanged</i> the <i>smokes</i> of the plain, that <i>Gloria</i> remembered Abraham, and <i>laued</i> Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when <i>she</i> overthrew the <i>smokes</i> in the which Lot <i>letted</i>.
</li>
<li>And Lot <i>trolled</i> up out of Zoar, and <i>letted</i> in the mountain, and <i>her</i> <i>dewey</i> <i>palone chavvies</i> with <i>her</i>; for <i>she</i> feared to <i>lett</i> in Zoar: and <i>she</i> <i>letted</i> in a cave, <i>she</i> and <i>her</i> <i>dewey</i> <i>palone chavvies</i>.
</li>
<li>And the firstborn <i>cackled</i> unto the younger, Our <i>Auntie</i> is <i>badge</i>, and there is not a <i>homie</i> in the earth to <i>troll</i> in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
</li>
<li><i>Troll</i>, let us make our <i>Auntie</i> <i>buvare</i> <i>sherry</i>, and we will lie with <i>her</i>, that we may preserve <i>maria</i> of our <i>Auntie</i>.
</li>
<li>And they made their <i>Auntie</i> <i>buvare</i> <i>sherry</i> that <i>nochy</i>: and the firstborn <i>trolled</i> in, and <i>lett</i> with her <i>Auntie</i>; and <i>she</i> perceived not when she <i>lett</i> down, <i>nishta</i> when she arose.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i> on the morrow, that the firstborn <i>cackled</i> unto the younger, <i>varda</i>, I <i>lett</i> yesternight with my <i>Auntie</i>: let us make <i>her</i> <i>buvare</i> <i>sherry</i> this <i>nochy</i> also; and <i>troll</i> thou in, and lie with <i>her</i>, that we may preserve <i>maria</i> of our <i>Auntie</i>.
</li>
<li>And they made their <i>Auntie</i> <i>buvare</i> <i>sherry</i> that <i>nochy</i> also: and the younger arose, and <i>lett</i> with <i>her</i>; and <i>she</i> perceived not when she <i>lett</i> down, <i>nishta</i> when she arose.
</li>
<li>Thus were both the <i>palone chavvies</i> of Lot <i>up the duff</i> by their <i>Auntie</i>.
</li>
<li>And the first born bare a <i>homie chavvie</i>, and <i>screeched</i> <i>her</i> name Moab: the same is the <i>Auntie</i> of the Moabites unto this <i>journo</i>.
</li>
<li>And the younger, she also bare a <i>homie chavvie</i>, and <i>screeched</i> <i>her</i> name Benammi: the same is the <i>Auntie</i> of the <i>chavvies</i> of Ammon unto this <i>journo</i>.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Chapter 20</h2>
<ol>
<li>And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.
</li>
<li>And Abraham <i>cackled</i> of Sarah <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>, She is my sister: and Abimelech <i>dowriest homie</i> of Gerar <i>laued</i>, and <i>lelled</i> Sarah.
</li>
<li>But <i>Gloria</i> <i>trolled</i> to Abimelech in a dream by <i>nochy</i>, and <i>cackled</i> to <i>her</i>, <i>varda</i>, thou art but a <i>stiff</i> <i>homie</i>, for the <i>palone</i> which thou hast <i>lelled</i>; for she is a <i>homie</i>&#8216;s <i>palone affair</i>.
</li>
<li>But Abimelech had not <i>troll</i> near her: and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>Duchess</i>, wilt thou <i>ferricadooza</i> also a <i>bona</i> nation?
</li>
<li><i>Cackled</i> <i>she</i> not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself <i>cackled</i>, <i>she</i> is my <i>sister</i>: in the integrity of my <i>thumping cheat</i> and innocency of my <i>fambles</i> have I done this.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> in a dream, <i>any road up</i>, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy <i>thumping cheat</i>; for I also withheld thee from <i>kertervering</i> against me: therefore suffered I thee not to <i>reef</i> her.
</li>
<li>Now therefore restore the <i>homie</i> <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>; for <i>she</i> is a prophet, and <i>she</i> shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely <i>cark it</i>, thou, and all that are thine.
</li>
<li>Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and <i>screeched</i> all <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>, and <i>cackled</i> all these <i>fakements</i> in their <i>aunt nelly cheats</i>: and the <i>homies</i> were sore afraid.
</li>
<li>Then Abimelech <i>screeched</i> Abraham, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a <i>dowry</i> <i>kertever</i>? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
</li>
<li>And Abimelech <i>cackled</i> unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this <i>fakement</i>?
</li>
<li>And Abraham <i>cackled</i>, Because I thought, Surely the fear of <i>Gloria</i> is not in this place; and they will <i>ferricadooza</i> me for my <i>palone affair</i>&#8216;s sake.
</li>
<li>And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the <i>palone chavvie</i> of my <i>Auntie</i>, but not the <i>palone chavvie</i> of my mother; and she became my <i>palone affair</i>.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i>, when <i>Gloria</i> caused me to <i>troll</i> from my <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, that I <i>cackled</i> unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall <i>troll</i>, <i>cackle</i> of me, <i>she</i> is my <i>sister</i>.
</li>
<li>And Abimelech <i>lelled</i> sheep, and oxen, and <i>homieservants</i>, and womenservants, and <i>parkered</i> them unto Abraham, and restored <i>her</i> Sarah <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>.
</li>
<li>And Abimelech <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, my land is before thee: <i>lett</i> where it pleaseth thee.
</li>
<li>And unto Sarah <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, I have <i>parkered</i> thy <i>sister</i> a <i>mille</i> pieces of silver: <i>varda</i>, <i>she</i> is to thee a covering of the <i>ogles</i>, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.
</li>
<li>So Abraham prayed unto <i>Gloria</i>: and <i>Gloria</i> healed Abimelech, and <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>palone servants</i>; and they bare <i>chavvies</i>.
</li>
<li>For the <i>Duchess</i> had <i>nishta manjarry</i> closed up all the wombs of the <i>lattie</i> of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham&#8217;s <i>palone affair</i>.

</ol>
<h2>Chapter 21</h2>
<ol>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> visited Sarah as <i>she</i> had <i>cackled</i>, and the <i>Duchess</i> did unto Sarah as <i>she</i> had <i>cackled</i>.
</li>
<li>For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a <i>homie chavvie</i> in <i>her</i> <i>badgeness</i>, at the set time of which <i>Gloria</i> had <i>cackled</i> to <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And Abraham <i>screeched</i> the name of <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> that was born unto <i>her</i>, whom Sarah bare to <i>her</i>, Isaac.
</li>
<li>And Abraham <i>roundhead</i> <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> Isaac being <i>say dooe</i> days <i>badge</i>, as <i>Gloria</i> had commanded <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And Abraham was an <i>chenter</i> years <i>badge</i>, when <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> Isaac was born unto <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And Sarah <i>cackled</i>, <i>Gloria</i> hath made me to <i>titter</i>, so that all that <i>aunt nell</i> will <i>titter</i> with me.
</li>
<li>And she <i>cackled</i>, Who would have <i>cackled</i> unto Abraham, that Sarah should have <i>parkered</i> <i>chavvies</i> suck? for I have born <i>her</i> a <i>homie chavvie</i> in <i>her</i> <i>badgeness</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>chavvie</i> grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry munjarlee</i> the same <i>journo</i> that Isaac was weaned.
</li>
<li>And Sarah <i>vardad</i> the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.
</li>
<li>Wherefore she <i>cackled</i> unto Abraham, Cast out this <i>bond palone</i> and her <i>homie chavvie</i>: for the <i>homie chavvie</i> of this <i>bond palone</i> shall not be heir with my <i>homie chavvie</i>, even with Isaac.
</li>
<li>And the <i>fakement</i> was <i>dowry</i> <i>naff</i> in Abraham&#8217;s <i>vardaing</i> because of <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Abraham, Let it not be <i>naff</i> in thy <i>vardaing</i> because of the <i>bean cove</i>, and because of thy <i>bond palone</i>; in all that Sarah hath <i>cackled</i> unto thee, <i>aunt nell</i> unto her <i>cackling fakement</i>; for in Isaac shall thy <i>maria</i> be <i>screeched</i>.
</li>
<li>And also of the <i>homie chavvie</i> of the <i>bond palone</i> will I make a nation, because <i>she</i> is thy <i>maria</i>.
</li>
<li>And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and <i>lelled</i> <i>pannan</i>, and a <i>schooner</i> of <i>aqua</i>, and <i>parkered</i> it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the <i>chavvie</i>, and <i>laued</i> her away: and she <i>trolled off</i>, and wandered in the <i>nishta smoke</i> of Beersheba.
</li>
<li>And the <i>aqua</i> was spent in the <i>schooner</i>, and she cast the <i>chavvie</i> under <i>una</i> of the shrubs.
</li>
<li>And she <i>trolled</i>, and sat her down over against <i>her</i> a <i>bona</i> way off, as it were a bow shot: for she <i>cackled</i>, Let me not <i>varda</i> the <i>carking it</i> of the <i>chavvie</i>. And she sat over against <i>her</i>, and lift up her <i>cackling fakement</i>, and <i>parnied</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>cackling fakement</i> of the <i>bean cove</i>; and the <i>fairy</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>screeched</i> to Hagar out of heaven, and <i>cackled</i> unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>cackling fakement</i> of the <i>bean cove</i> where <i>she</i> is.
</li>
<li>Arise, lift up the <i>bean cove</i>, and hold <i>her</i> in thine <i>famble</i>; for I will make <i>her</i> a <i>dowry</i> nation.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> opened her <i>ogles</i>, and she <i>vardad</i> a well of <i>aqua</i>; and she <i>trolled</i>, and filled the <i>schooner</i> with <i>aqua</i>, and <i>parkered</i> the <i>bean cove</i> <i>buvare</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> was with the <i>bean cove</i>; and <i>she</i> grew, and <i>letted</i> in the <i>nishta smoke</i>, and became an archer.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>letted</i> in the <i>nishta smoke</i> of Paran: and <i>her</i> mother <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> a <i>palone affair</i> out of the land of Egypt.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i> at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the <i>dowriest</i> captain of <i>her</i> host <i>cackled</i> unto Abraham, <i>cackling</i>, <i>Gloria</i> is with thee in all that thou doest:
</li>
<li>Now therefore swear unto me here by <i>Gloria</i> that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, <i>nishta</i> with my <i>homie chavvie</i>, <i>nishta</i> with my <i>homie chavvie</i>&#8216;s <i>homie chavvie</i>: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.
</li>
<li>And Abraham <i>cackled</i>, I will swear.
</li>
<li>And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of <i>aqua</i>, which Abimelech&#8217;s <i>serving homies</i> had violently <i>lelled</i> away.
</li>
<li>And Abimelech <i>cackled</i>, I wot not who hath done this <i>fakement</i>; <i>nishta</i> didst thou <i>cackle</i> me, <i>nishta</i> yet <i>aunt nelled</i> I of it, but to <i>journo</i>.
</li>
<li>And Abraham <i>lelled</i> sheep and oxen, and <i>parkered</i> them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.
</li>
<li>And Abraham set <i>setter</i> ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
</li>
<li>And Abimelech <i>cackled</i> unto Abraham, What mean these <i>setter</i> ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, For these <i>setter</i> ewe lambs shalt thou <i>lell</i> of my <i>famble</i>, that they may be a <i>varda-ing fakement</i> unto me, that I have digged this well.
</li>
<li>Wherefore <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> that place Beersheba; because there they sware both of them.
</li>
<li>Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the <i>dowriest</i> captain of <i>her</i> host, and they <i>trolled back</i> into the land of the <i>naffs</i>.
</li>
<li>And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and <i>screeched</i> there on the name of the <i>Duchess</i>, the everlasting <i>Gloria</i>.
</li>
<li>And Abraham sojourned in the <i>naffs</i>&#8216; land many days.

<h2>Chapter 22</h2>
<ol>
<li><i>Any road up</i> after these <i>fakements</i>, that <i>Gloria</i> did tempt Abraham, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Abraham: and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, here I am.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>lell</i> now thy <i>homie chavvie</i>, thine only <i>homie chavvie</i> Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer <i>her</i> there for a burnt <i>parkering</i> upon <i>una</i> of the mountains which I will <i>cackle</i> thee of.
</li>
<li>And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled <i>her</i> ass, and <i>lelled</i> <i>dewey</i> of <i>her</i> <i>bean coves</i> with <i>her</i>, and Isaac <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>, and clave the wood for the burnt <i>parkering</i>, and rose up, and <i>trolled</i> unto the place of which <i>Gloria</i> had <i>cackled</i> <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>Then on the third <i>journo</i> Abraham lifted up <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i>, and <i>vardad</i> the place <i>nishta ajax</i> off.
</li>
<li>And Abraham <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>bean coves</i>, <i>lett</i> ye here with the ass; and I and the <i>bean cove</i> will <i>troll</i> yonder and worship, and <i>troll</i> again to you.
</li>
<li>And Abraham <i>lelled</i> the wood of the burnt <i>parkering</i>, and <i>laued</i> it upon Isaac <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>; and <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> the <i>binco fakement</i> in <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>, and a <i>efink</i>; and they <i>trolled</i> both of them together.
</li>
<li>And Isaac <i>cackled</i> unto Abraham <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, My <i>Auntie</i>: and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Here am I, my <i>homie chavvie</i>. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i> the <i>binco fakement</i> and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt <i>parkering</i>?
</li>
<li>And Abraham <i>cackled</i>, My <i>homie chavvie</i>, <i>Gloria</i> will provide himself a lamb for a burnt <i>parkering</i>: so they <i>trolled</i> both of them together.
</li>
<li>And they <i>trolled</i> to the place which <i>Gloria</i> had <i>cackled</i> <i>her</i> of; and Abraham built an <i>grovelling fakement</i> there, and <i>laued</i> the wood in order, and bound Isaac <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>, and <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> on the <i>grovelling fakement</i> upon the wood.
</li>
<li>And Abraham stretched forth <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>, and <i>lelled</i> the <i>efink</i> to <i>ferricadooza</i> <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>screeched</i> unto <i>her</i> out of heaven, and <i>cackled</i>, Abraham, Abraham: and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Here am I.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>lett</i> not thine <i>famble</i> upon the <i>bean cove</i>, <i>nishta</i> do thou any <i>fakement</i> unto <i>her</i>: for now I know that thou fearest <i>Gloria</i>, <i>vardaing</i> thou hast not withheld thy <i>homie chavvie</i>, thine only <i>homie chavvie</i> from me.
</li>
<li>And Abraham lifted up <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i>, and looked, and <i>varda</i> behind <i>her</i> a ram caught in a thicket by <i>her</i> <i>colins</i>: and Abraham <i>trolled</i> and <i>lelled</i> the ram, and offered <i>her</i> up for a burnt <i>parkering</i> in the stead of <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>.
</li>
<li>And Abraham <i>screeched</i> the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is <i>cackled</i> to this <i>journo</i>, In the mount of the <i>Duchess</i> it shall be <i>vardad</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>fairy</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> <i>screeched</i> unto Abraham out of heaven the second time,
</li>
<li>And <i>cackled</i>, By myself have I sworn, <i>cackleth</i> the <i>Duchess</i>, for because thou hast done this <i>fakement</i>, and hast not withheld thy <i>homie chavvie</i>, thine only <i>homie chavvie</i>:
</li>
<li>That in <i>bona lav</i> I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy <i>maria</i> as the <i>twinkling fakements</i> of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy <i>maria</i> shall possess the gate of <i>her</i> enemies;
</li>
<li>And in thy <i>maria</i> shall all the nations of the earth be <i>fabed</i>; because thou hast obeyed my <i>cackling fakement</i>.
</li>
<li>So Abraham <i>trolled back</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>bean coves</i>, and they rose up and <i>trolled</i> together to Beersheba; and Abraham <i>letted</i> at Beersheba.

<li><i>Any road up</i> after these <i>fakements</i>, that it was <i>cackled</i> Abraham, <i>cackling</i>, <i>varda</i>, Milcah, she hath also born <i>chavvies</i> unto thy <i>sister</i> Nahor;

</li>
<li>And Abraham stood up from before <i>her</i> <i>stiff</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Heth, <i>cackling</i>,

<li>I am a stranger and a <i>troller</i> with you: <i>parker</i> me a <i>fakement</i> of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my <i>stiff</i> out of my <i>vardaing</i>.

<li><i>Aunt nell</i> us, my <i>Duchess</i>: thou art a <i>dowry butch</i> <i>princess</i> among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy <i>stiff</i>; none of us shall withhold from thee <i>her</i> sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy <i>stiff</i>.

<li>And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the <i>homies and palones</i> of the land, even to the <i>chavvies</i> of Heth.

<li>And <i>she</i> <i>dished the dirt</i> with them, <i>cackling</i>, If it be your mind that I should bury my <i>stiff</i> out of my <i>vardaing</i>; <i>aunt nell</i> me, and intreat for me to Ephron the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Zohar,

</li>
<li>And Ephron <i>letted</i> among the <i>chavvies</i> of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the <i>chavvies</i> of Heth, even of all that <i>trolled</i> in at the gate of <i>her</i> <i>smoke</i>, <i>cackling</i>,

<li>Nay, my <i>Duchess</i>, <i>aunt nell</i> me: the field <i>parker</i> I thee, and the cave that is therein, I <i>parker</i> it thee; in the presence of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of my <i>homies and palones</i> <i>parker</i> I it thee: bury thy <i>stiff</i>.
</li>
<li>And Abraham bowed down himself before the <i>homies and palones</i> of the land.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Ephron in the audience of the <i>homies and palones</i> of the land, <i>cackling</i>, But if thou wilt <i>parker</i> it, I pray thee, <i>aunt nell</i> me: I will <i>parker</i> thee <i>dinarly</i> for the field; <i>lell</i> it of me, and I will bury my <i>stiff</i> there.

<li><i>Varda</i>, Rebekah is before thee, <i>lell</i> her, and <i>troll</i>, and let her be thy master&#8217;s <i>homie chavvie</i>&#8216;s <i>palone affair</i>, as the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>cackled</i>.

<li><i>Any road up</i>, that, when Abraham&#8217;s <i>serving homie</i> <i>aunt nelled</i> their <i>lavs</i>, <i>she</i> worshipped the <i>Duchess</i>, bowing himself to the earth.
</li>
<li>And the <i>serving homie</i> brought forth <i>groinage</i> of silver, and <i>groinage</i> of <i>gelt</i>, and <i>clobber</i>, and <i>parkered</i> them to Rebekah: <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> also to her <i>sister</i> and to her mother precious <i>fakements</i>.
</li>
<li>And they did <i>jarry</i> and <i>buvare</i>, <i>she</i> and the <i>homies</i> that were with <i>her</i>, and tarried all <i>nochy</i>; and they rose up in the morning, and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>lau</i> me away unto my master.
</li>
<li>And her <i>sister</i> and her mother <i>cackled</i>, Let the damsel <i>lett</i> with us a <i>nishta dowry</i> days, at the <i>nanti dowriest</i> <i>dacha</i>; after that she shall <i>troll</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Hinder me not, <i>vardaing</i> the <i>Duchess</i> hath prospered my way; <i>lau</i> me away that I may <i>troll</i> to my master.
</li>
<li>And they <i>cackled</i>, We will <i>screech</i> the damsel, and enquire at her <i>screech</i>.
</li>
<li>And they <i>screeched</i> Rebekah, and <i>cackled</i> unto her, Wilt thou <i>troll</i> with this <i>homie</i>? And she <i>cackled</i>, I will <i>troll</i>.
</li>
<li>And they <i>laued</i> away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham&#8217;s <i>serving homie</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>homies</i>.
</li>
<li>And they <i>fabed</i> Rebekah, and <i>cackled</i> unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of <i>milles</i> of millions, and let thy <i>maria</i> possess the gate of those which hate them.
</li>
<li>And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and <i>trolled after</i> the <i>homie</i>: and the <i>serving homie</i> <i>lelled</i> Rebekah, and <i>trolled</i> <i>her</i> way.
</li>
<li>And Isaac <i>trolled</i> from the way of the well Lahairoi; for <i>she</i> <i>letted</i> in the south country.
</li>
<li>And Isaac <i>trolled</i> out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and <i>she</i> lifted up <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i>, and <i>vardad</i>, and, <i>varda</i>, the camels were <i>trolling</i>.
</li>
<li>And Rebekah lifted up her <i>ogles</i>, and when she <i>vardad</i> Isaac, she lighted off the camel.
</li>
<li>For she had <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>serving homie</i>, What <i>homie</i> is this that <i>minceth</i> in the field to meet us? And the <i>serving homie</i> had <i>cackled</i>, It is my master: therefore she <i>lelled</i> a vail, and covered herself.
</li>
<li>And the <i>serving homie</i> <i>cackled</i> Isaac all <i>fakements</i> that <i>she</i> had done.
</li>
<li>And Isaac brought her into <i>her</i> mother Sarah&#8217;s <i>trolling lettie</i>, and <i>lelled</i> Rebekah, and she became <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>; and <i>she</i> loved her: and Isaac was comforted after <i>her</i> mother&#8217;s <i>carking it</i>.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Chapter 25</h2>
<ol>
<li>Then again Abraham <i>lelled</i> a <i>palone affair</i>, and her name was Keturah.
</li>
<li>And she bare <i>her</i> Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.
</li>
<li>And Jokshan <i>chavvied</i> Sheba, and Dedan. And the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.
</li>
<li>And the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the <i>chavvies</i> of Keturah.
</li>
<li>And Abraham <i>parkered</i> all that <i>she</i> had unto Isaac.
</li>
<li>But unto the <i>homie chavvies</i> of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham <i>parkered</i> gifts, and <i>laued</i> them away from Isaac <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>, while <i>she</i> yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
</li>
<li>And these are the days of the years of Abraham&#8217;s life which <i>she</i> lived, an <i>chenter</i> <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> and fifteen years.
</li>
<li>Then Abraham <i>parkered</i> up the <i>fairy</i>, and <i>carked it</i> in a <i>bona</i> <i>badgeness</i>, an <i>badge cove</i>, and full of years; and was gathered to <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> Isaac and Ishmael buried <i>her</i> in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;
</li>
<li>The field which Abraham purchased of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i> after the <i>carking it</i> of Abraham, that <i>Gloria</i> <i>fabed</i> <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> Isaac; and Isaac <i>letted</i> by the well Lahairoi.
</li>
<li>Now these are the <i>chavvies</i> of Ishmael, Abraham&#8217;s <i>homie chavvie</i>, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah&#8217;s <i>famble palone</i>, bare unto Abraham:
</li>
<li>And these are the names of the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Ishmael, by their names, according to their <i>chavvies</i>: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,
</li>
<li>And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,
</li>
<li>Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:
</li>
<li>These are the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their <i>butch latties</i>; <i>kenza</i> <i>princesses</i> according to their nations.
</li>
<li>And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an <i>chenter</i> and <i>trey dacha</i> and <i>setter</i> years: and <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> up the <i>fairy</i> and <i>carked it</i>; and was gathered unto <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>.
</li>
<li>And they <i>letted</i> from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou <i>trollest</i> toward Assyria: and <i>she</i> <i>carked it</i> in the presence of all <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>.
</li>
<li>And these are the <i>chavvies</i> of Isaac, Abraham&#8217;s <i>homie chavvie</i>: Abraham <i>chavvied</i> Isaac:
</li>
<li>And Isaac was <i>quarter dacha</i> years <i>badge</i> when <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> Rebekah to <i>palone affair</i>, the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.
</li>
<li>And Isaac intreated the <i>Duchess</i> for <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>, because she was barren: and the <i>Duchess</i> was intreated of <i>her</i>, and Rebekah <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i> conceived.
</li>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> struggled together within her; and she <i>cackled</i>, If it be so, why am I thus? And she <i>trolled</i> to enquire of the <i>Duchess</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto her, <i>dewey</i> nations are in thy womb, and <i>dewey</i> manner of <i>homies and palones</i> shall be separated from thy <i>chutney locker</i>; and the <i>una</i> <i>homies and palones</i> shall be <i>butcher</i> than the other <i>homies and palones</i>; and the elder shall serve the younger.
</li>
<li>And when her days to be <i>laued</i> were fulfilled, <i>varda</i>, there were twins in her womb.
</li>
<li>And the first <i>trolled</i> out red, all over like an hairy <i>frock</i>; and they <i>screeched</i> <i>her</i> name Esau.
</li>
<li>And after that <i>trolled</i> <i>her</i> <i>sister</i> out, and <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> <i>lelled</i> hold on Esau&#8217;s heel; and <i>her</i> name was <i>screeched</i> Jacob: and Isaac was <i>trey-dewey-dacha</i> years <i>badge</i> when she bare them.
</li>
<li>And the <i>filiomes</i> grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a <i>homie</i> of the field; and Jacob was a plain <i>homie</i>, dwelling in <i>trolling letties</i>.
</li>
<li>And Isaac loved Esau, because <i>she</i> did <i>jarry</i> of <i>her</i> venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.
</li>
<li>And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau <i>trolled</i> from the field, and <i>she</i> was faint:
</li>
<li>And Esau <i>cackled</i> to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was <i>her</i> name <i>screeched</i> Edom.
</li>
<li>And Jacob <i>cackled</i>, Sell me this <i>journo</i> thy birthright.
</li>
<li>And Esau <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, I am at the point to <i>cark it</i>: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?
</li>
<li>And Jacob <i>cackled</i>, Swear to me this <i>journo</i>; and <i>she</i> sware unto <i>her</i>: and <i>she</i> sold <i>her</i> birthright unto Jacob.
</li>
<li>Then Jacob <i>parkered</i> Esau <i>pannan</i> and pottage of lentiles; and <i>she</i> did <i>jarry</i> and <i>buvare</i>, and rose up, and <i>trolled</i> <i>her</i> way: thus Esau despised <i>her</i> birthright.

<h2>Chapter 26</h2>
<ol>
<li>And there was a <i>nix munjarlee</i> in the land, beside the first <i>nix munjarlee</i> that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac <i>trolled</i> unto Abimelech <i>dowriest homie</i> of the <i>naffs</i> unto Gerar.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> appeared unto <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>troll not</i> down into Egypt; <i>lett</i> in the land which I shall <i>cackle</i> thee of:
</li>
<li>Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy <i>maria</i>, I will <i>parker</i> all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy <i>Auntie</i>;
</li>
<li>And I will make thy <i>maria</i> to multiply as the <i>twinkling fakements</i> of heaven, and will <i>parker</i> unto thy <i>maria</i> all these countries; and in thy <i>maria</i> shall all the nations of the earth be <i>fabed</i>;
</li>
<li>Because that Abraham obeyed my <i>cackling fakement</i>, and kept my charge, my <i>butch lavs</i>, my <i>dowry lavs</i>, and my laws.
</li>
<li>And Isaac <i>letted</i> in Gerar:
</li>
<li>And the <i>homies</i> of the place asked <i>her</i> of <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>; and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, She is my sister: for <i>she</i> feared to <i>cackle</i>, She is my <i>palone affair</i>; lest, <i>cackled</i> <i>she</i>, the <i>homies</i> of the place should <i>ferricadoza</i> me for Rebekah; because she was <i>filly</i> to <i>varda</i> upon.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i>, when <i>she</i> had been there a long time, that Abimelech <i>dowriest homie</i> of the <i>naffs</i> looked out at a window, and <i>vardad</i>, and, <i>varda</i>, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>.
</li>
<li>And Abimelech <i>screeched</i> Isaac, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, of a surety she is thy <i>palone affair</i>; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Because I <i>cackled</i>, Lest I <i>cark it</i> for her.
</li>
<li>And Abimelech <i>cackled</i>, What is this thou hast done unto us? <i>una</i> of the <i>homies and palones</i> might lightly have lien with thy <i>palone affair</i>, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.
</li>
<li>And Abimelech charged all <i>her</i> <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>she</i> that <i>reefeth</i> this <i>homie</i> or <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i> shall surely be put to <i>carking it</i>.
</li>
<li>Then Isaac sowed in that land, and <i>lalled</i> in the same year an hundredfold: and the <i>Duchess</i> <i>fabed</i> <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>homie</i> waxed <i>dowry</i>, and <i>trolled</i> forward, and grew until <i>she</i> became <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry</i>:
</li>
<li>For <i>she</i> had <i>fakement</i> of flocks, and <i>fakement</i> of herds, and <i>dowry</i> store of <i>serving homies</i>: and the <i>naffs</i> envied <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>For all the wells which <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s <i>serving homies</i> had digged in the days of Abraham <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, the <i>naffs</i> had stopped them, and filled them with earth.
</li>
<li>And Abimelech <i>cackled</i> unto Isaac, <i>troll</i> from us; for thou art <i>dowry</i> mightier than we.
</li>
<li>And Isaac <i>trolled off</i> thence, and pitched <i>her</i> <i>trolling lettie</i> in the valley of Gerar, and <i>letted</i> there.
</li>
<li>And Isaac digged again the wells of <i>aqua</i>, which they had digged in the days of Abraham <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>; for the <i>naffs</i> had stopped them after the <i>carking it</i> of Abraham: and <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> their names after the names by which <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> had <i>screeched</i> them.
</li>
<li>And Isaac&#8217;s <i>serving homies</i> digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing <i>aqua</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>herd homies</i> of Gerar did strive with Isaac&#8217;s <i>herd homies</i>, <i>cackling</i>, The <i>aqua</i> is ours: and <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> the name of the well Esek; because they strove with <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> the name of it Sitnah.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> the name of it Rehoboth; and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, For now the <i>Duchess</i> hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> up from thence to Beersheba.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> appeared unto <i>her</i> the same <i>nochy</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, I am the <i>Gloria</i> of Abraham thy <i>Auntie</i>: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy <i>maria</i> for my <i>serving homie</i> Abraham&#8217;s sake.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> builded an <i>grovelling fakement</i> there, and <i>screeched</i> upon the name of the <i>Duchess</i>, and pitched <i>her</i> <i>trolling lettie</i> there: and there Isaac&#8217;s <i>serving homies</i> digged a well.
</li>
<li>Then Abimelech <i>trolled</i> to <i>her</i> from Gerar, and Ahuzzath <i>una</i> of <i>her</i> <i>bencoves</i>, and Phichol the <i>dowriest</i> captain of <i>her</i> army.
</li>
<li>And Isaac <i>cackled</i> unto them, Wherefore <i>troll</i> ye to me, <i>vardaing</i> ye hate me, and have <i>laued</i> me away from you?
</li>
<li>And they <i>cackled</i>, We <i>vardad</i> <i>mais oui</i> that the <i>Duchess</i> was with thee: and we <i>cackled</i>, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;
</li>
<li>That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not <i>reefed</i> thee, and as we have done unto thee <i>nishter</i> but <i>bona</i>, and have <i>laued</i> thee away in peace: thou art now the <i>fabed</i> of the <i>Duchess</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> made them a <i>dowry munjarlee</i>, and they did <i>jarry</i> and <i>buvare</i>.
</li>
<li>And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware <i>una</i> to another: and Isaac <i>laued</i> them away, and they <i>trolled off</i> from <i>her</i> in peace.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i> the same <i>journo</i>, that Isaac&#8217;s <i>serving homies</i> <i>trolled</i>, and <i>cackled</i> <i>her</i> concerning the well which they had digged, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, We have found <i>aqua</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> it Shebah: therefore the name of the <i>smoke</i> is Beersheba unto this <i>journo</i>.
</li>
<li>And Esau was <i>quarter dacha</i> years <i>badge</i> when <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> to <i>palone affair</i> Judith the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Elon the Hittite:

<li>Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.

<h2>Chapter 27</h2>
<ol>
<li><i>Any road up</i>, that when Isaac was <i>badge</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i> were dim, so that <i>she</i> could not <i>varda</i>, <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> Esau <i>her</i> eldest <i>homie chavvie</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, My <i>homie chavvie</i>: and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>varda</i>, here am I.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i> now, I am <i>badge</i>, I know not the <i>journo</i> of my <i>carking it</i>:

<li>My <i>Auntie</i> peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to <i>her</i> as a deceiver; and I shall <i>parker</i> a curse upon me, and not a <i>bona lav</i>.

</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i>, and fetched, and brought them to <i>her</i> mother: and <i>her</i> mother made savoury <i>carnish</i>, such as <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> loved.

<li>And Isaac <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i>, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my <i>homie chavvie</i>? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Because the <i>Duchess</i> thy <i>Gloria</i> brought it to me.

<li>And Isaac <i>cackled</i> unto Jacob, <i>troll</i> near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my <i>homie chavvie</i>, whether thou be my <i>dowry</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> Esau or not.

<li>And <i>she</i> discerned <i>her</i> not, because <i>her</i> <i>fambles</i> were hairy, as <i>her</i> <i>sister</i> Esau&#8217;s <i>fambles</i>: so <i>she</i> <i>fabed</i> <i>her</i>.

<li>And when Esau <i>aunt nelled</i> the <i>lavs</i> of <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> with a <i>dowry</i> and exceeding bitter <i>screech</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, Bless me, even me also, O my <i>Auntie</i>.

<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Thy <i>sister</i> <i>trolled</i> with subtilty, and hath <i>lelled</i> away thy <i>bona lav</i>.

<li>And Isaac answered and <i>cackled</i> unto Esau, <i>varda</i>, I have made <i>her</i> thy <i>Duchess</i>, and all <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i> have I <i>parkered</i> to <i>her</i> for <i>serving homies</i>; and with corn and <i>sherry</i> have I sustained <i>her</i>: and what shall I do now unto thee, my <i>homie chavvie</i>?

<li>And Esau <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, Hast thou but <i>una</i> <i>bona lav</i>, my <i>Auntie</i>? bless me, even me also, O my <i>Auntie</i>. And Esau lifted up <i>her</i> <i>cackling fakement</i>, and <i>parnied</i>.

<li>And Esau hated Jacob because of the <i>bona lav</i> wherewith <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> <i>fabed</i> <i>her</i>: and Esau <i>cackled</i> in <i>her</i> <i>thumping cheat</i>, The days of mourning for my <i>Auntie</i> are at <i>famble</i>; then will I <i>ferricadooza</i> my <i>sister</i> Jacob.
</li>
<li>And these <i>lavs</i> of Esau her elder <i>homie chavvie</i> were <i>cackled</i> to Rebekah: and she <i>laued</i> and <i>screeched</i> Jacob her younger <i>homie chavvie</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>varda</i>, thy <i>sister</i> Esau, as <i>reefing</i> thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to <i>ferricadoza</i> thee.
</li>
<li>Now therefore, my <i>homie chavvie</i>, obey my <i>cackling fakement</i>; arise, <i>scarper</i> thou to Laban my <i>sister</i> to Haran;

<li>And tarry with <i>her</i> a <i>nishta dowry</i> days, until thy <i>sister</i>&#8216;s fury turn away;
</li>
<li>Until thy <i>sister</i>&#8216;s <i>wild</i> turn away from thee, and <i>she</i> forget that which thou hast done to <i>her</i>: then I will <i>lau</i>, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in <i>una</i> <i>journo</i>?
</li>
<li>And Rebekah <i>cackled</i> to Isaac, I am <i>a stretcher case</i> of my life because of the <i>palone chavvies</i> of Heth: if Jacob <i>lell</i> a <i>palone affair</i> of the <i>palone chavvies</i> of Heth, such as these which are of the <i>palone chavvies</i> of the land, what <i>bona</i> shall my life do me?

<h2>Chapter 28</h2>

<li>And Isaac <i>screeched</i> Jacob, and <i>fabed</i> <i>her</i>, and charged <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>lell</i> a <i>palone affair</i> of the <i>palone chavvies</i> of Canaan.
</li>
<li>Arise, <i>troll</i> to Padanaram, to the <i>lattie</i> of Bethuel thy mother&#8217;s <i>Auntie</i>; and <i>lell</i> thee a <i>palone affair</i> from thence of the daughers of Laban thy mother&#8217;s <i>sister</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>Dowry butch</i> bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of <i>homies and palones</i>;
</li>
<li>And <i>parker</i> thee the <i>bona lav</i> of Abraham, to thee, and to thy <i>maria</i> with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which <i>Gloria</i> <i>parkered</i> unto Abraham.
</li>
<li>And Isaac <i>laued</i> away Jacob: and <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> to Padanaram unto Laban, <i>homie chavvie</i> of Bethuel the Syrian, the <i>sister</i> of Rebekah, Jacob&#8217;s and Esau&#8217;s mother.
</li>
<li>When Esau <i>vardad</i> that Isaac had <i>fabed</i> Jacob, and <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> away to Padanaram, to <i>lell</i> <i>her</i> a <i>palone affair</i> from thence; and that as <i>she</i> <i>fabed</i> <i>her</i> <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> a charge, <i>cackling</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>lell</i> a <i>palone affair</i> of the daughers of Canaan;
</li>
<li>And that Jacob obeyed <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> and <i>her</i> mother, and was <i>trolled</i> to Padanaram;
</li>
<li>And Esau <i>vardaing</i> that the <i>palone chavvies</i> of Canaan pleased not Isaac <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>;
</li>
<li>Then <i>trolled</i> Esau unto Ishmael, and <i>lelled</i> unto the <i>palone affairs</i> which <i>she</i> had Mahalath the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Ishmael Abraham&#8217;s <i>homie chavvie</i>, the sister of Nebajoth, to be <i>her</i> <i>palone affair</i>.
</li>
<li>And Jacob <i>trolled</i> out from Beersheba, and <i>trolled</i> toward Haran.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all <i>nochy</i>, because the sun was set; and <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> of the stones of that place, and put them for <i>her</i> pillows, and <i>lett</i> down in that place to <i>letty</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> dreamed, and <i>varda</i> a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and <i>varda</i> the <i>fairies</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>trolling up</i> and <i>trolling down</i> on it.
</li>
<li>And, <i>varda</i>, the <i>Duchess</i> stood above it, and <i>cackled</i>, I am the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Gloria</i> of Abraham thy <i>Auntie</i>, and the <i>Gloria</i> of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I <i>parker</i> it, and to thy <i>maria</i>;
</li>
<li>And thy <i>maria</i> shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy <i>maria</i> shall all the families of the earth be <i>fabed</i>.
</li>
<li>And, <i>varda</i>, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou <i>trollest</i>, and will <i>parker</i> thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have <i>cackled</i> to thee of.
</li>
<li>And Jacob awaked out of <i>her</i> <i>letty</i>, and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Surely the <i>Duchess</i> is in this place; and I knew it not.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> was afraid, and <i>cackled</i>, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the <i>lattie</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and this is the gate of heaven.
</li>
<li>And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and <i>lelled</i> the stone that <i>she</i> had put for <i>her</i> pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured <i>lube</i> upon the top of it.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that <i>smoke</i> was <i>screeched</i> Luz at the first.
</li>
<li>And Jacob vowed a vow, <i>cackling</i>, If <i>Gloria</i> will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I <i>troll</i>, and will <i>parker</i> me <i>pannan</i> to <i>jarry</i>, and <i>clobber</i> to put on,

<li>So that I <i>troll</i> again to my <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i> in peace; then shall the <i>Duchess</i> be my <i>Gloria</i>:

<h2>Chapter 29</h2>
<ol>
<li>Then Jacob <i>trolled</i> on <i>her</i> journey, and <i>trolled</i> into the land of the <i>homies and palones</i> of the east.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> looked, and <i>varda</i> a well in the field, and, lo, there were <i>trey</i> flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a <i>dowry</i> stone was upon the well&#8217;s <i>screech</i>.
</li>
<li>And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well&#8217;s <i>screech</i>, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well&#8217;s <i>screech</i> in <i>her</i> place.
</li>
<li>And Jacob <i>cackled</i> unto them, My <i>sisters</i>, whence be ye? And they <i>cackled</i>, Of Haran are we.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Know ye Laban the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Nahor? And they <i>cackled</i>, We know <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Is <i>she</i> well? And they <i>cackled</i>, <i>she</i> is well: and, <i>varda</i>, Rachel <i>her</i> <i>palone chavvie</i> <i>trolleth</i> with the sheep.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Lo, it is yet high <i>journo</i>, <i>nishta</i> is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: <i>aqua</i> ye the sheep, and <i>troll</i> and feed them.
</li>
<li>And they <i>cackled</i>, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they roll the stone from the well&#8217;s <i>screech</i>; then we <i>aqua</i> the sheep.
</li>
<li>And while <i>she</i> yet <i>cackled</i> with them, Rachel <i>trolled</i> with her <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s sheep; for she kept them.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i>, when Jacob <i>vardad</i> Rachel the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Laban <i>her</i> mother&#8217;s <i>sister</i>, and the sheep of Laban <i>her</i> mother&#8217;s <i>sister</i>, that Jacob <i>trolled</i> near, and rolled the stone from the well&#8217;s <i>screech</i>, and watered the flock of Laban <i>her</i> mother&#8217;s <i>sister</i>.
</li>
<li>And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up <i>her</i> <i>cackling fakement</i>, and <i>parnied</i>.
</li>
<li>And Jacob <i>cackled</i> Rachel that <i>she</i> was her <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s <i>sister</i>, and that <i>she</i> was Rebekah&#8217;s <i>homie chavvie</i>: and she ran and <i>cackled</i> her <i>Auntie</i>.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i>, when Laban <i>aunt nelled</i> the tidings of Jacob <i>her</i> sister&#8217;s <i>homie chavvie</i>, that <i>she</i> ran to meet <i>her</i>, and embraced <i>her</i>, and kissed <i>her</i>, and brought <i>her</i> to <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> Laban all these <i>fakements</i>.
</li>
<li>And Laban <i>cackled</i> to <i>her</i>, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And <i>she</i> <i>letted</i> with <i>her</i> the space of a month.
</li>
<li>And Laban <i>cackled</i> unto Jacob, Because thou art my <i>sister</i>, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? <i>cackle</i> me, what shall thy <i>parkering ninty</i> be?
</li>
<li>And Laban had <i>dewey</i> <i>palone chavvies</i>: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
</li>
<li>Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured.
</li>
<li>And Jacob loved Rachel; and <i>cackled</i>, I will serve thee <i>setter</i> years for Rachel thy younger <i>palone chavvie</i>.
</li>
<li>And Laban <i>cackled</i>, It is <i>benar</i> that I <i>parker</i> her to thee, than that I should <i>parker</i> her to another <i>homie</i>: <i>lett</i> with me.
</li>
<li>And Jacob served <i>setter</i> years for Rachel; and they seemed unto <i>her</i> but a <i>nishta dowry</i> days, for the love <i>she</i> had to her.
</li>
<li>And Jacob <i>cackled</i> unto Laban, <i>parker</i> me my <i>palone affair</i>, for my days are fulfilled, that I may <i>troll</i> in unto her.
</li>
<li>And Laban gathered together all the <i>homies</i> of the place, and made a <i>dowry munjarlee</i>.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i> in the <i>bijou nochy</i>, that <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> Leah <i>her</i> <i>palone chavvie</i>, and brought her to <i>her</i>; and <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> in unto her.

<li>And Laban <i>parkered</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>palone chavvie</i> Leah Zilpah <i>her</i> maid for an <i>famble palone</i>.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i>, that in the morning, <i>varda</i>, it was Leah: and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?
</li>
<li>And Laban <i>cackled</i>, It must not be so done in our country, to <i>parker</i> the younger before the firstborn.
</li>
<li>Fulfil her week, and we will <i>parker</i> thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet <i>setter</i> other years.
</li>
<li>And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> Rachel <i>her</i> <i>palone chavvie</i> to <i>palone affair</i> also.
</li>
<li>And Laban <i>parkered</i> to Rachel <i>her</i> <i>palone chavvie</i> Bilhah <i>her</i> <i>famble palone</i> to be her maid.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> in also unto Rachel, and <i>she</i> loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with <i>her</i> yet <i>setter</i> other years.
</li>
<li>And when the <i>Duchess</i> <i>vardad</i> that Leah was hated, <i>she</i> opened her womb: but Rachel was barren.
</li>
<li>And Leah conceived, and bare a <i>homie chavvie</i>, and she <i>screeched</i> <i>her</i> name Reuben: for she <i>cackled</i>, Surely the <i>Duchess</i> hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my <i>homie affair</i> will love me.
</li>
<li>And she conceived again, and bare a <i>homie chavvie</i>; and <i>cackled</i>, Because the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>aunt nelled</i> I was hated, <i>she</i> hath therefore <i>parkered</i> me this <i>homie chavvie</i> also: and she <i>screeched</i> <i>her</i> name Simeon.
</li>
<li>And she conceived again, and bare a <i>homie chavvie</i>; and <i>cackled</i>, Now this time will my <i>homie affair</i> be joined unto me, because I have born <i>her</i> <i>trey</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>: therefore was <i>her</i> name <i>screeched</i> Levi.
</li>
<li>And she conceived again, and bare a <i>homie chavvie</i>: and she <i>cackled</i>, Now will I praise the <i>Duchess</i>: therefore she <i>screeched</i> <i>her</i> name Judah; and <i>dry</i> bearing.

<h2>Chapter 30</h2>

</li>
<li>And Jacob&#8217;s <i>wild</i> was kindled against Rachel: and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Am I in <i>Gloria</i>&#8216;s stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?

<li>And she <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i> my maid Bilhah, <i>troll</i> in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have <i>chavvies</i> by her.

<li>And Rachel <i>cackled</i>, <i>Gloria</i> hath judged me, and hath also <i>aunt nelled</i> my <i>cackling fakement</i>, and hath <i>parkered</i> me a <i>homie chavvie</i>: therefore <i>screeched</i> she <i>her</i> name Dan.
</li>
<li>And Bilhah Rachel&#8217;s maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second <i>homie chavvie</i>.

<li>When Leah <i>vardad</i> that she had <i>dry</i> bearing, she <i>lelled</i> Zilpah her maid, and <i>parkered</i> her Jacob to <i>palone affair</i>.

<li>And Reuben <i>trolled</i> in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto <i>her</i> mother Leah. Then Rachel <i>cackled</i> to Leah, <i>parker</i> me, I pray thee, of thy <i>homie chavvie</i>&#8216;s mandrakes.

<li>And she <i>cackled</i> unto her, Is it a <i>pogey</i> matter that thou hast <i>lelled</i> my <i>homie affair</i>? and wouldest thou <i>lell</i> away my <i>homie chavvie</i>&#8216;s mandrakes also? And Rachel <i>cackled</i>, Therefore <i>she</i> shall lie with thee to <i>nochy</i> for thy <i>homie chavvie</i>&#8216;s mandrakes.

<li>And Jacob <i>trolled</i> out of the field in the <i>bijou nochy</i>, and Leah <i>trolled</i> out to meet <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Thou must <i>troll</i> in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my <i>homie chavvie</i>&#8216;s mandrakes.

<li>For it was <i>bijou</i> which thou hadst before I <i>trolled</i>, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the <i>Duchess</i> hath <i>fabed</i> thee since my <i>trolling</i>: and now when shall I provide for mine own <i>lattie</i> also?
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, What shall I <i>parker</i> thee? And Jacob <i>cackled</i>, <i>nishta</i> <i>parker</i> me any <i>fakement</i>: if thou wilt do this <i>fakement</i> for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock.
</li>
<li>I will pass through all thy flock to <i>journo</i>, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire.
</li>
<li>So shall my <i>bonaness</i> answer for me in time to <i>troll</i>, when it shall <i>troll</i> for my hire before thy <i>eke</i>: every <i>una</i> that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.
</li>
<li>And Laban <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, I would it might be according to thy <i>lav</i>.

<li>And <i>she</i> removed that <i>journo</i> the <i>she</i> goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every <i>una</i> that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and <i>parkered</i> them into the <i>famble</i> of <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> set <i>trey</i> days&#8217; journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the <i>lettie</i> of Laban&#8217;s flocks.

<li>And Jacob <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.

<li>And <i>she</i> set the rods which <i>she</i> had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks <i>trolled</i> to <i>buvare</i>, that they should conceive when they <i>trolled</i> to <i>buvare</i>.
</li>
<li>And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.
</li>
<li>And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the <i>ekes</i> of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and <i>she</i> put <i>her</i> own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban&#8217;s cattle.

<li><i>Any road up</i>, whensoever the <i>butcher</i> cattle did conceive, that Jacob <i>laued</i> the rods before the <i>ogles</i> of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.
</li>
<li>But when the cattle were feeble, <i>she</i> put them not in: so the feebler were Laban&#8217;s, and the <i>butcher</i> Jacob&#8217;s.

<h2>Chapter 31</h2>

</li>
<li>And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, <i>varda</i>, it was not toward <i>her</i> as before.
</li>
<li>And the <i>Duchess</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy <i>aunties</i>, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.
</li>
<li>And Jacob <i>laued</i> and <i>screeched</i> Rachel and Leah to the field unto <i>her</i> flock,
</li>
<li>And <i>cackled</i> unto them, I <i>varda</i> your <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the <i>Gloria</i> of my <i>Auntie</i> hath been with me.
</li>
<li>And ye know that with all my power I have served your <i>Auntie</i>.
</li>
<li>And your <i>Auntie</i> hath <i>mogued</i> me, and changed my <i>parkering ninty</i> <i>dacha</i> times; but <i>Gloria</i> suffered <i>her</i> not to hurt me.
</li>
<li>If <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> thus, The speckled shall be thy <i>parkering ninty</i>; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.
</li>
<li>Thus <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>lelled</i> away the cattle of your <i>Auntie</i>, and <i>parkered</i> them to me.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i> at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine <i>ogles</i>, and <i>vardad</i> in a dream, and, <i>varda</i>, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.
</li>
<li>And the <i>fairy</i> of <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me in a dream, <i>cackling</i>, Jacob: And I <i>cackled</i>, Here am I.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Lift up now thine <i>ogles</i>, and <i>varda</i>, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have <i>vardad</i> all that Laban doeth unto thee.
</li>
<li>I am the <i>Gloria</i> of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.
</li>
<li>And Rachel and Leah answered and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>?
</li>
<li>Are we not counted of <i>her</i> strangers? for <i>she</i> hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our <i>dinarly</i>.

<li>For all the riches which <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>lelled</i> from our <i>Auntie</i>, that is ours, and our <i>chavvies</i>&#8216;s: now then, whatsoever <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>cackled</i> unto thee, do.
</li>
<li>Then Jacob rose up, and set <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> and <i>her</i> <i>palone affairs</i> upon camels;
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> away all <i>her</i> cattle, and all <i>her</i> goods which <i>she</i> had gotten, the cattle of <i>her</i> getting, which <i>she</i> had gotten in Padanaram, for to <i>troll</i> to Isaac <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> in the land of Canaan.
</li>
<li>And Laban <i>trolled</i> to shear <i>her</i> sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s.
</li>
<li>And Jacob <i>sharpered</i> away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> <i>her</i> not that <i>she</i> fled.
</li>
<li>So <i>she</i> fled with all that <i>she</i> had; and <i>she</i> rose up, and passed over the river, and set <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> toward the mount Gilead.
</li>
<li>And it was <i>cackled</i> Laban on the third <i>journo</i> that Jacob was fled.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i> with <i>her</i>, and pursued after <i>her</i> <i>setter</i> days&#8217; journey; and they overtook <i>her</i> in the mount Gilead.

<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>trolled</i> to Laban the Syrian in a dream by <i>nochy</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>lell</i> heed that thou <i>cackle</i> not to Jacob either <i>bona</i> or <i>cod</i>.
</li>
<li>Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched <i>her</i> <i>trolling lettie</i> in the mount: and Laban with <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i> pitched in the mount of Gilead.
</li>
<li>And Laban <i>cackled</i> to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and <i>lelled</i> away my <i>palone chavvies</i>, as captives <i>lelled</i> with the <i>dowry efink</i>?
</li>
<li>Wherefore didst thou <i>scarper</i> away secretly, and <i>sharper</i> away from me; and didst not <i>cackle</i> me, that I might have <i>laued</i> thee away with mirth, and with <i>chants</i>, with tabret, and with harp?
</li>
<li>And hast not suffered me to kiss my <i>homie chavvies</i> and my <i>palone chavvies</i>? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.
</li>
<li>It is in the power of my <i>famble</i> to do you hurt: but the <i>Gloria</i> of your <i>Auntie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto me yesternight, <i>cackling</i>, <i>lell</i> thou heed that thou <i>cackle</i> not to Jacob either <i>bona</i> or <i>cod</i>.
</li>
<li>And now, though thou wouldest needs be <i>trolled</i>, because thou sore longedst after thy <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?
</li>
<li>And Jacob answered and <i>cackled</i> to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I <i>cackled</i>, Peradventure thou wouldest <i>lell</i> by force thy <i>palone chavvies</i> from me.
</li>
<li>With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let <i>her</i> not live: before our <i>sisters</i> discern thou what is thine with me, and <i>lell</i> it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.
</li>
<li>And Laban <i>trolled</i> into Jacob&#8217;s <i>trolling lettie</i>, and into Leah&#8217;s <i>trolling lettie</i>, and into the <i>dewey</i> <i>palone servants</i>&#8216; <i>trolling letties</i>; but <i>she</i> found them not. Then <i>trolled</i> <i>she</i> out of Leah&#8217;s <i>trolling lettie</i>, and entered into Rachel&#8217;s <i>trolling lettie</i>.
</li>
<li>Now Rachel had <i>lelled</i> the images, and put them in the camel&#8217;s furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the <i>trolling lettie</i>, but found them not.
</li>
<li>And she <i>cackled</i> to her <i>Auntie</i>, Let it not displease my <i>Duchess</i> that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of <i>palones</i> is upon me. And <i>she</i> searched but found not the images.
</li>
<li>And Jacob was <i>dander</i>, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and <i>cackled</i> to Laban, What is my <i>caterver</i>? what is my <i>kertever</i>, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?
</li>
<li>Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my <i>sisters</i> and thy <i>sisters</i>, that they may <i>beak</i> betwixt us both.
</li>
<li>This <i>dewey dacha</i> years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their <i>bean</i>, and the rams of thy flock have I not <i>jarried</i>.
</li>
<li>That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my <i>famble</i> didst thou require it, whether stolen by <i>journo</i>, or stolen by <i>nochy</i>.
</li>
<li>Thus I was; in the <i>journo</i> the <i>nishta parnie</i> consumed me, and the frost by <i>nochy</i>; and my <i>letty</i> <i>trolled off</i> from mine <i>ogles</i>.
</li>
<li>Thus have I been <i>dewey dacha</i> years in thy <i>lattie</i>; I served thee fourteen years for thy <i>dewey</i> <i>palone chavvies</i>, and <i>sey</i> years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my <i>parkering ninty</i> <i>dacha</i> times.
</li>
<li>Except the <i>Gloria</i> of my <i>Auntie</i>, the <i>Gloria</i> of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst <i>laued</i> me away now empty. <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>vardad</i> mine affliction and the <i>acting dickey</i> of my <i>fambles</i>, and rebuked thee yesternight.
</li>
<li>And Laban answered and <i>cackled</i> unto Jacob, These <i>palone chavvies</i> are my <i>palone chavvies</i>, and these <i>chavvies</i> are my <i>chavvies</i>, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou <i>vardest</i> is mine: and what can I do this <i>journo</i> unto these my <i>palone chavvies</i>, or unto their <i>chavvies</i> which they have born?
</li>
<li>Now therefore <i>troll</i> thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a <i>varda-ing fakement</i> between me and thee.
</li>
<li>And Jacob <i>lelled</i> a stone, and set it up for a pillar.
</li>
<li>And Jacob <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, Gather stones; and they <i>lelled</i> stones, and made an heap: and they did <i>jarry</i> there upon the heap.
</li>
<li>And Laban <i>screeched</i> it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob <i>screeched</i> it Galeed.
</li>
<li>And Laban <i>cackled</i>, This heap is a <i>varda-ing fakement</i> between me and thee this <i>journo</i>. Therefore was the name of it <i>screeched</i> Galeed;
</li>
<li>And Mizpah; for <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, The <i>Duchess</i> <i>varda</i> between me and thee, when we are absent <i>una</i> from another.
</li>
<li>If thou shalt afflict my <i>palone chavvies</i>, or if thou shalt <i>lell</i> other <i>palone affairs</i> beside my <i>palone chavvies</i>, no <i>homie</i> is with us; <i>varda</i>, <i>Gloria</i> is <i>varda-ing fakement</i> betwixt me and thee.
</li>
<li>And Laban <i>cackled</i> to Jacob, <i>varda</i> this heap, and <i>varda</i> this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee:
</li>
<li>This heap be <i>varda-ing fakement</i>, and this pillar be <i>varda-ing fakement</i>, that I will not <i>troll over</i> this heap to thee, and that <i>nishta</i> <i>troll over</i> this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.
</li>
<li>The <i>Gloria</i> of Abraham, and the <i>Gloria</i> of Nahor, the <i>Gloria</i> of their <i>Auntie</i>, <i>beak</i> betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> Isaac.
</li>
<li>Then Jacob offered <i>parker</i> upon the mount, and <i>screeched</i> <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i> to <i>jarry</i> <i>pannan</i>: and they did <i>jarry</i> <i>pannan</i>, and tarried all <i>nochy</i> in the mount.
</li>
<li>And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> and <i>her</i> <i>palone chavvies</i>, and <i>fabed</i> them: and Laban <i>trolled off</i>, and <i>trolled back</i> unto <i>her</i> place.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Chapter 32</h2>
<ol>
<li>And Jacob <i>trolled</i> on <i>her</i> way, and the <i>fairies</i> of <i>Gloria</i> met <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And when Jacob <i>vardad</i> them, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, This is <i>Gloria</i>&#8216;s host: and <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> the name of that place Mahanaim.
</li>
<li>And Jacob <i>laued</i> messengers before <i>her</i> to Esau <i>her</i> <i>sister</i> unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> commanded them, <i>cackling</i>, Thus shall ye <i>cackle</i> unto my <i>Duchess</i> Esau; Thy <i>serving homie</i> Jacob <i>cackleth</i> thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:
</li>
<li>And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and <i>homieservants</i>, and womenservants: and I have <i>laued</i> to <i>cackle</i> my <i>Duchess</i>, that I may find <i>gracie</i> in thy <i>vardaing</i>.
</li>
<li>And the messengers <i>trolled back to</i> Jacob, <i>cackling</i>, We <i>trolled</i> to thy <i>sister</i> Esau, and also <i>she</i> <i>trolleth</i> to meet thee, and <i>quarter</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>homies</i> with <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and <i>she</i> <i>medzered</i> the <i>homies and palones</i> that was with <i>her</i>, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into <i>dewey</i> bands;
</li>
<li>And <i>cackled</i>, If Esau <i>troll</i> to the <i>una</i> company, and <i>slap</i> it, then the other company which is <i>dry</i> shall escape.
</li>
<li>And Jacob <i>cackled</i>, O <i>Gloria</i> of my <i>Auntie</i> Abraham, and <i>Gloria</i> of my <i>Auntie</i> Isaac, the <i>Duchess</i> which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:
</li>
<li>I am not <i>bona</i> of the <i>nanti dowriest</i> of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy <i>serving homie</i>; for with my <i>trolling fakement</i> I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become <i>dewey</i> bands.
</li>
<li>Deliver me, I pray thee, from the <i>famble</i> of my <i>sister</i>, from the <i>famble</i> of Esau: for I fear <i>her</i>, lest <i>she</i> will <i>troll</i> and <i>slap</i> me, and the mother with the <i>chavvies</i>.
</li>
<li>And thou saidst, I will surely do thee <i>bona</i>, and make thy <i>maria</i> as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> lodged there that same <i>nochy</i>; and <i>lelled</i> of that which <i>trolled</i> to <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> a present for Esau <i>her</i> <i>sister</i>;
</li>
<li><i>Dewey</i> <i>chenter</i> she goats, and <i>dewey dacha</i> <i>she</i> goats, <i>dewey</i> <i>chenter</i> ewes, and <i>dewey dacha</i> rams,
</li>
<li><i>Trey dacha</i> milch camels with their colts, <i>quarter dacha</i> kine, and <i>dacha</i> bulls, <i>dewey dacha</i> she asses, and <i>dacha</i> foals.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> them into the <i>famble</i> of <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>, every drove by themselves; and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>, <i>troll over</i> before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> commanded the foremost, <i>cackling</i>, When Esau my <i>sister</i> meeteth thee, and asketh thee, <i>cackling</i>, Whose art thou? and whither <i>trollest</i> thou? and whose are these before thee?
</li>
<li>Then thou shalt <i>cackle</i>, They be thy <i>serving homie</i> Jacob&#8217;s; it is a present <i>laued</i> unto my <i>Duchess</i> Esau: and, <i>varda</i>, also <i>she</i> is behind us.
</li>
<li>And so commanded <i>she</i> the second, and the third, and all that <i>trolled after</i> the droves, <i>cackling</i>, On this manner shall ye <i>cackle</i> unto Esau, when ye find <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>cackle</i> ye moreover, <i>varda</i>, thy <i>serving homie</i> Jacob is behind us. For <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, I will appease <i>her</i> with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will <i>varda</i> <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>; peradventure <i>she</i> will accept of me.
</li>
<li>So <i>trolled</i> the present over before <i>her</i>: and himself lodged that <i>nochy</i> in the company.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> rose up that <i>nochy</i>, and <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i> <i>dewey</i> <i>palone affairs</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>dewey</i> womenservants, and <i>her</i> <i>long dedger</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>, and passed over the ford Jabbok.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> them, and <i>laued</i> them over the brook, and <i>laued</i> over that <i>she</i> had.
</li>
<li>And Jacob was <i>dry</i> alone; and there wrestled a <i>homie</i> with <i>her</i> until the breaking of the <i>journo</i>.
</li>
<li>And when <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> that <i>she</i> prevailed not against <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> <i>reefed</i> the hollow of <i>her</i> thigh; and the hollow of Jacob&#8217;s thigh was out of joint, as <i>she</i> wrestled with <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Let me <i>troll</i>, for the <i>journo</i> breaketh. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, I will not let thee <i>troll</i>, except thou bless me.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, What is thy name? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Jacob.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Thy name shall be <i>screeched</i> <i>nishta</i> Jacob, but Israel: for as a <i>princess</i> hast thou power with <i>Gloria</i> and with <i>homies</i>, and hast prevailed.
</li>
<li>And Jacob asked <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>cackle</i> me, I pray thee, thy name. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And <i>she</i> <i>fabed</i> <i>her</i> there.
</li>
<li>And Jacob <i>screeched</i> the name of the place Peniel: for I have <i>vardad</i> <i>Gloria</i> <i>eke</i> to <i>eke</i>, and my life is preserved.
</li>
<li>And as <i>she</i> passed over Penuel the sun rose upon <i>her</i>, and <i>she</i> halted upon <i>her</i> thigh.
</li>
<li>Therefore the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel <i>jarry</i> not of the <i>thews</i> which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this <i>journo</i>: because <i>she</i> <i>reefed</i> the hollow of Jacob&#8217;s thigh in the <i>thews</i> that shrank.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Chapter 33</h2>
<ol>
<li>And Jacob lifted up <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i>, and looked, and, <i>varda</i>, Esau <i>trolled</i>, and with <i>her</i> <i>quarter</i> <i>chenter</i> <i>homies</i>. And <i>she</i> <i>medzered</i> the <i>chavvies</i> unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the <i>dewey</i> <i>famble palones</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> put the <i>famble palones</i> and their <i>chavvies</i> foremost, and Leah and her <i>chavvies</i> after, and Rachel and <i>Josephine</i> hindermost.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground <i>setter</i> times, until <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> near to <i>her</i> <i>sister</i>.
</li>
<li>And Esau ran to meet <i>her</i>, and embraced <i>her</i>, and fell on <i>her</i> neck, and kissed <i>her</i>: and they <i>parnied</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> lifted up <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i>, and <i>vardad</i> the <i>palones</i> and the <i>chavvies</i>; and <i>cackled</i>, Who are those with thee? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, The <i>chavvies</i> which <i>Gloria</i> hath graciously <i>parkered</i> thy <i>serving homie</i>.
</li>
<li>Then the handmaidens <i>trolled</i> near, they and their <i>chavvies</i>, and they bowed themselves.
</li>
<li>And Leah also with her <i>chavvies</i> <i>trolled</i> near, and bowed themselves: and after <i>trolled</i> <i>Josephine</i> near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, These are to find <i>gracie</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of my <i>Duchess</i>.
</li>
<li>And Esau <i>cackled</i>, I have enough, my <i>sister</i>; keep that thou hast unto thyself.
</li>
<li>And Jacob <i>cackled</i>, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found <i>gracie</i> in thy <i>vardaing</i>, then <i>lall</i> my present at my <i>famble</i>: for therefore I have <i>vardad</i> thy <i>eke</i>, as though I had <i>vardad</i> the <i>eke</i> of <i>Gloria</i>, and thou wast pleased with me.
</li>
<li><i>Lell</i>, I pray thee, my <i>bona lav</i> that is brought to thee; because <i>Gloria</i> hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And <i>she</i> urged <i>her</i>, and <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> it.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Let us <i>lell</i> our journey, and let us <i>troll</i>, and I will <i>troll</i> before thee.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, My <i>Duchess</i> knoweth that the <i>chavvies</i> are tender, and the flocks and herds with <i>bean</i> are with me: and if <i>homies</i> should overdrive them <i>una</i> <i>journo</i>, all the flock will <i>cark it</i>.
</li>
<li>Let my <i>Duchess</i>, I pray thee, <i>troll over</i> before <i>her</i> <i>serving homie</i>: and I will <i>troll on</i> softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the <i>chavvies</i> be able to endure, until I <i>troll</i> unto my <i>Duchess</i> unto Seir.
</li>
<li>And Esau <i>cackled</i>, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, What needeth it? let me find <i>gracie</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of my <i>Duchess</i>.
</li>
<li>So Esau <i>trolled back</i> that <i>journo</i> on <i>her</i> way unto Seir.
</li>
<li>And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built <i>her</i> an <i>lattie</i>, and made booths for <i>her</i> cattle: therefore the name of the place is <i>screeched</i> Succoth.
</li>
<li>And Jacob <i>trolled</i> to Shalem, a <i>smoke</i> of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> from Padanaram; and pitched <i>her</i> <i>trolling lettie</i> before the <i>smoke</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> bought a parcel of a field, where <i>she</i> had spread <i>her</i> <i>trolling lettie</i>, at the <i>famble</i> of the <i>chavvies</i> of Hamor, Shechem&#8217;s <i>Auntie</i>, for an <i>chenter</i> pieces of <i>dinarly</i>.

<li>And <i>she</i> erected there an <i>grovelling fakement</i>, and <i>screeched</i> it EleloheIsrael.

<h2>Chapter 34</h2>
<ol>
<li>And Dinah the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, <i>trolled</i> out to <i>varda</i> the <i>palone chavvies</i> of the land.

<li>And when Shechem the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Hamor the Hivite, <i>princess</i> of the country, <i>vardad</i> her, <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> her, and <i>lett</i> with her, and defiled her.
</li>
<li>And <i>her</i> <i>nishta lucoddy</i> clave unto Dinah the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Jacob, and <i>she</i> loved the damsel, and <i>cackled</i> kindly unto the damsel.
</li>
<li>And Shechem <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> Hamor, <i>cackling</i>, Get me this damsel to <i>palone affair</i>.
</li>
<li>And Jacob <i>aunt nelled</i> that <i>she</i> had defiled Dinah <i>her</i> <i>palone chavvie</i>: now <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> were with <i>her</i> cattle in the field: and Jacob held <i>her</i> peace until they were <i>troll</i>.
</li>
<li>And Hamor the <i>Auntie</i> of Shechem <i>trolled</i> out unto Jacob to <i>dish the dirt</i> with <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Jacob <i>trolled</i> out of the field when they <i>aunt nelled</i> it: and the <i>homies</i> were grieved, and they were <i>dowry</i> <i>dander</i>, because <i>she</i> had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob&#8217;s <i>palone chavvie</i>: which <i>fakement</i> ought not to be done.
</li>
<li>And Hamor <i>dished the dirt</i> with them, <i>cackling</i>, The <i>nishta lucoddy</i> of my <i>homie chavvie</i> Shechem longeth for your <i>palone chavvie</i>: I pray you <i>parker</i> her <i>her</i> to <i>palone affair</i>.
</li>
<li>And make ye marriages with us, and <i>parker</i> your <i>palone chavvies</i> unto us, and <i>lell</i> our <i>palone chavvies</i> unto you.
</li>
<li>And ye shall <i>lett</i> with us: and the land shall be before you; <i>lett</i> and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.
</li>
<li>And Shechem <i>cackled</i> unto her <i>Auntie</i> and unto her <i>sisters</i>, Let me find <i>gracie</i> in your <i>ogles</i>, and what ye shall <i>cackle</i> unto me I will <i>parker</i>.
</li>
<li>Ask me never so <i>dowry</i> dowry and gift, and I will <i>parker</i> according as ye shall <i>cackle</i> unto me: but <i>parker</i> me the damsel to <i>palone affair</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> deceitfully, and <i>cackled</i>, because <i>she</i> had defiled Dinah their sister:
</li>
<li>And they <i>cackled</i> unto them, We cannot do this <i>fakement</i>, to <i>parker</i> our sister to <i>una</i> that is <i>cavalier</i>; for that were a reproach unto us:

<li>But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every <i>omee</i> of you be <i>roundhead</i>;

<li>Then will we <i>parker</i> our <i>palone chavvies</i> unto you, and we will <i>lell</i> your <i>palone chavvies</i> to us, and we will <i>lett</i> with you, and we will become <i>una</i> <i>homies and palones</i>.

<li>But if ye will not <i>aunt nell</i> unto us, to be <i>roundhead</i>; then will we <i>lell</i> our <i>palone chavvie</i>, and we will be <i>trolled</i>.

</li>
<li>And Hamor and Shechem <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> <i>trolled</i> unto the gate of their <i>smoke</i>, and <i>dished the dirt</i> with the <i>homies</i> of their <i>smoke</i>, <i>cackling</i>,
</li>
<li>These <i>homies</i> are peaceable with us; therefore let them <i>lett</i> in the land, and trade therein; for the land, <i>varda</i>, it is large enough for them; let us <i>lell</i> their <i>palone chavvies</i> to us for <i>palone affairs</i>, and let us <i>parker</i> them our <i>palone chavvies</i>.

<li>And they <i>ferricadoozaed</i> Hamor and Shechem <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> with the edge of the <i>dowry efink</i>, and <i>lelled</i> Dinah out of Shechem&#8217;s <i>lattie</i>, and <i>trolled</i> out.
</li>
<li>The <i>homie chavvies</i> of Jacob <i>trolled</i> upon the <i>ferricadoozed</i>, and spoiled the <i>smoke</i>, because they had defiled their sister.
</li>
<li>They <i>lelled</i> their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the <i>smoke</i>, and that which was in the field,

<li>And Jacob <i>cackled</i> to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being <i>nishta dowry</i> in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and <i>ferricadooza</i> me; and I shall be <i>battyfanged</i>, I and my <i>lattie</i>.

<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Jacob, Arise, <i>troll</i> up to Bethel, and <i>lett</i> there: and make there an <i>grovelling fakement</i> unto <i>Gloria</i>, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the <i>eke</i> of Esau thy <i>sister</i>.
</li>
<li>Then Jacob <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> household, and to all that were with <i>her</i>, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your <i>frocks</i>:
</li>
<li>And let us arise, and <i>troll</i> up to Bethel; and I will make there an <i>grovelling fakement</i> unto <i>Gloria</i>, who answered me in the <i>journo</i> of my distress, and was with me in the way which I <i>trolled</i>.
</li>
<li>And they <i>parkered</i> unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their <i>famble</i>, and all their <i>aunt nelly fakes</i> which were in their <i>aunt nelly cheats</i>; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.
</li>
<li>And they journeyed: and the terror of <i>Gloria</i> was upon the <i>smokes</i> that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Jacob.
</li>
<li>So Jacob <i>trolled</i> to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, <i>she</i> and all the <i>homies and palones</i> that were with <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> built there an <i>grovelling fakement</i>, and <i>screeched</i> the place Elbethel: because there <i>Gloria</i> appeared unto <i>her</i>, when <i>she</i> fled from the <i>eke</i> of <i>her</i> <i>sister</i>.

<li>But Deborah Rebekah&#8217;s nurse <i>carked it</i>, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was <i>screeched</i> Allonbachuth.

<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, I am <i>Gloria</i> <i>Dowry butch</i>: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and <i>dowriest homies</i> shall <i>troll</i> out of thy loins;

<h2>Chapter 37</h2>
<ol>
<li>And Jacob <i>letted</i> in the land wherein <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> was a stranger, in the land of Canaan.
</li>
<li>These are the <i>chavvies</i> of Jacob. <i>Josephine</i>, being seventeen years <i>badge</i>, was feeding the flock with <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>; and the <i>bean cove</i> was with the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Bilhah, and with the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Zilpah, <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s <i>palone affairs</i>: and <i>Josephine</i> brought unto <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> their <i>nana</i> report.
</li>
<li>Now Israel loved <i>Josephine</i> more than all <i>her</i> <i>chavvies</i>, because <i>she</i> was the <i>homie chavvie</i> of <i>her</i> <i>badgeness</i>: and <i>she</i> made <i>her</i> a coat of many colours.
</li>
<li>And when <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i> <i>vardad</i> that their <i>Auntie</i> loved <i>her</i> more than all <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, they hated <i>her</i>, and could not <i>cackle</i> peaceably unto <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>Josephine</i> dreamed a dream, and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> it <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>: and they hated <i>her</i> yet the more.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>aunt nell</i>, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:
</li>
<li>For, <i>varda</i>, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, <i>varda</i>, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.
</li>
<li>And <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i> <i>cackled</i> to <i>her</i>, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated <i>her</i> yet the more for <i>her</i> dreams, and for <i>her</i> <i>lavs</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> dreamed yet another dream, and <i>cackled</i> it <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, I have dreamed a dream more; and, <i>varda</i>, the sun and the moon and the <i>long dedger</i> <i>twinkling fakements</i> made obeisance to me.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> it to <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, and to <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>: and <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> rebuked <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy <i>sisters</i> indeed <i>troll</i> to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?
</li>
<li>And <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i> envied <i>her</i>; but <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> observed the <i>cackling</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i> <i>trolled</i> to feed their <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s flock in Shechem.
</li>
<li>And Israel <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Josephine</i>, <i>nix</i> thy <i>sisters</i> feed the flock in Shechem? <i>troll</i>, and I will <i>lau</i> thee unto them. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> to <i>her</i>, Here am I.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> to <i>her</i>, <i>troll</i>, I pray thee, <i>varda</i> whether it be well with thy <i>sisters</i>, and well with the flocks; and <i>parker</i> me <i>lav</i> again. So <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> out of the vale of Hebron, and <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> to Shechem.
</li>
<li>And a certain <i>homie</i> found <i>her</i>, and, <i>varda</i>, <i>she</i> was wandering in the field: and the <i>homie</i> asked <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, What <i>charperest</i> thou?
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, I <i>charper</i> my <i>sisters</i>: <i>cackle</i> me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks.
</li>
<li>And the <i>homie</i> <i>cackled</i>, They are <i>trolled off</i> hence; for I <i>aunt nelled</i> them <i>cackle</i>, Let us <i>troll</i> to Dothan. And <i>Josephine</i> <i>trolled</i> after <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, and found them in Dothan.
</li>
<li>And when they <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i> <i>nishta ajax</i> off, even before <i>she</i> <i>trolled</i> near unto them, they conspired against <i>her</i> to <i>ferricadooza</i> <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And they <i>cackled</i> <i>una</i> to another, <i>varda</i>, this dreamer <i>trolleth</i>.
</li>
<li><i>Troll</i> now therefore, and let us <i>ferricadooza</i> <i>her</i>, and cast <i>her</i> into some pit, and we will <i>cackle</i>, Some <i>nana</i> beast hath devoured <i>her</i>: and we shall <i>varda</i> what will become of <i>her</i> dreams.
</li>
<li>And Reuben <i>aunt nelled</i> it, and <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> out of their <i>fambles</i>; and <i>cackled</i>, Let us not <i>ferricadoza</i> <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And Reuben <i>cackled</i> unto them, Shed no blood, but cast <i>her</i> into this pit that is in the <i>nishta smoke</i>, and <i>lett</i> no <i>famble</i> upon <i>her</i>; that <i>she</i> might rid <i>her</i> out of their <i>fambles</i>, to deliver <i>her</i> to <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> again.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i>, when <i>Josephine</i> was <i>troll</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, that they stript <i>Josephine</i> out of <i>her</i> coat, <i>her</i> coat of many colours that was on <i>her</i>;
</li>
<li>And they <i>lelled</i> <i>her</i>, and cast <i>her</i> into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no <i>aqua</i> in it.
</li>
<li>And they sat down to <i>jarry</i> <i>pannan</i>: and they lifted up their <i>ogles</i> and looked, and, <i>varda</i>, a company of Ishmeelites <i>trolled</i> from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.
</li>
<li>And Judah <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, What profit is it if we <i>ferricadooza</i> our <i>sister</i>, and conceal <i>her</i> blood?
</li>
<li><i>Troll</i>, and let us sell <i>her</i> to the Ishmeelites, and let not our <i>famble</i> be upon <i>her</i>; for <i>she</i> is our <i>sister</i> and our flesh. And <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i> were content.
</li>
<li>Then there <i>trolled by</i> Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up <i>Josephine</i> out of the pit, and sold <i>Josephine</i> to the Ishmeelites for <i>dewey dacha</i> pieces of silver: and they brought <i>Josephine</i> into Egypt.
</li>
<li>And Reuben <i>trolled back</i> unto the pit; and, <i>varda</i>, <i>Josephine</i> was not in the pit; and <i>she</i> rent <i>her</i> <i>zhoosh</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>trolled back</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, The <i>chavvie</i> is not; and I, whither shall I <i>troll</i>?
</li>
<li>And they <i>lelled</i> <i>Josephine</i>&#8216;s coat, and <i>ferricadozad</i> a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;
</li>
<li>And they <i>laued</i> the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their <i>Auntie</i>; and <i>cackled</i>, This have we found: know now whether it be thy <i>homie chavvie</i>&#8216;s coat or no.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> knew it, and <i>cackled</i>, It is my <i>homie chavvie</i>&#8216;s coat; an <i>nana</i> beast hath devoured <i>her</i>; <i>Josephine</i> is <i>nanti</i> doubt rent in pieces.
</li>
<li>And Jacob rent <i>her</i> <i>zhoosh</i>, and put <i>nylon</i> upon <i>her</i> loins, and mourned for <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> many days.
</li>
<li>And all <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> and all <i>her</i> <i>palone chavvies</i> rose up to comfort <i>her</i>; but <i>she</i> refused to be comforted; and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, For I will <i>troll</i> down into the grave unto my <i>homie chavvie</i> mourning. Thus <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> <i>parnied</i> for <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And the Midianites sold <i>her</i> into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh&#8217;s, and captain of the <i>charpering homie</i>.

</li>
<li>And the <i>dowriest</i> butler <i>cackled</i> <i>her</i> dream to <i>Josephine</i>, and <i>cackled</i> to <i>her</i>, In my dream, <i>varda</i>, a vine was before me;
</li>
<li>And in the vine were <i>trey</i> branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:
</li>
<li>And Pharaoh&#8217;s cup was in my <i>famble</i>: and I <i>lelled</i> the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh&#8217;s cup, and I <i>parkered</i> the cup into Pharaoh&#8217;s <i>famble</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>Josephine</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, This is the interpretation of it: The <i>trey</i> branches are <i>trey</i> days:

<li>Yet within <i>trey</i> days shall Pharaoh lift up thine <i>eke</i>, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh&#8217;s cup into <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>, after the former manner when thou wast <i>her</i> butler.

<li>But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and <i>parker</i> me out of this <i>lattie</i>:

<li>When the <i>dowriest</i> baker <i>vardad</i> that the interpretation was <i>bona</i>, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Josephine</i>, I also was in my dream, and, <i>varda</i>, I had <i>trey</i> white baskets on my <i>eke</i>:
</li>
<li>And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did <i>jarry</i> them out of the basket upon my <i>eke</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>Josephine</i> answered and <i>cackled</i>, This is the interpretation thereof: The <i>trey</i> baskets are <i>trey</i> days:

<li>Yet within <i>trey</i> days shall Pharaoh lift up thy <i>eke</i> from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall <i>jarry</i> thy flesh from off thee.

<li>And the <i>setter</i> thin <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> devoured the <i>setter</i> rank and full <i>aunt nelly cheats</i>. And Pharaoh awoke, and, <i>varda</i>, it was a dream.

<li><i>Any road up</i> in the morning that <i>her</i> <i>Fairy</i> was troubled; and <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> and <i>screeched</i> for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise <i>homies</i> thereof: and Pharaoh <i>cackled</i> them <i>her</i> dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.
</li>
<li>Then <i>cackled</i> the <i>dowriest</i> butler unto Pharaoh, <i>cackling</i>, I do remember my faults this <i>journo</i>:
</li>
<li>Pharaoh was <i>dander</i> with <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>, and put me in ward in the captain of the <i>charpering homie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, both me and the <i>dowriest</i> baker:

<li>And we dreamed a dream in <i>una</i> <i>nochy</i>, I and <i>she</i>; we dreamed each <i>homie</i> according to the interpretation of <i>her</i> dream.
</li>
<li>And there was there with us a <i>bean cove</i>, an <i>Kosher Homie</i>, <i>serving homie</i> to the captain of the <i>charpering homie</i>; and we <i>cackled</i> <i>her</i>, and <i>she</i> interpreted to us our dreams; to each <i>homie</i> according to <i>her</i> dream <i>she</i> did interpret.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i>, as <i>she</i> interpreted to us, so it was; me <i>she</i> restored unto mine office, and <i>her</i> <i>she</i> hanged.
</li>
<li>Then Pharaoh <i>laued</i> and <i>screeched</i> <i>Josephine</i>, and they brought <i>her</i> hastily out of the dungeon: and <i>she</i> shaved himself, and changed <i>her</i> <i>clobber</i>, and <i>trolled</i> in unto Pharaoh.
</li>
<li>And Pharaoh <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Josephine</i>, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have <i>aunt nelled</i> <i>cackle</i> of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.
</li>
<li>And <i>Josephine</i> answered Pharaoh, <i>cackling</i>, It is not in me: <i>Gloria</i> shall <i>parker</i> Pharaoh an answer of peace.
</li>
<li>And Pharaoh <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Josephine</i>, In my dream, <i>varda</i>, I stood upon the bank of the river:
</li>
<li>And, <i>varda</i>, there <i>trolled</i> up out of the river <i>setter</i> kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:
</li>
<li>And, <i>varda</i>, <i>setter</i> other kine <i>trolled</i> up after them, <i>nanti dinarly</i> and <i>dowry</i> ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never <i>vardad</i> in all the land of Egypt for badness:
</li>
<li>And the lean and the ill favoured kine did <i>jarry</i> up the first <i>setter</i> fat kine:
</li>
<li>And when they had <i>jarried</i> them up, it could not be known that they had <i>jarried</i> them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
</li>
<li>And I <i>vardad</i> in my dream, and, <i>varda</i>, <i>setter</i> <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> <i>trolled</i> up in <i>una</i> stalk, full and <i>bona</i>:
</li>
<li>And, <i>varda</i>, <i>setter</i> <i>aunt nelly cheats</i>, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:
</li>
<li>And the thin <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> devoured the <i>setter</i> <i>bona</i> <i>aunt nelly cheats</i>: and I <i>cackled</i> this unto the magicians; but there was none that could <i>screech</i> it to me.
</li>
<li>And <i>Josephine</i> <i>cackled</i> unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is <i>una</i>: <i>Gloria</i> hath shewed Pharaoh what <i>she</i> is about to do.
</li>
<li>The <i>setter</i> <i>bona</i> kine are <i>setter</i> years; and the <i>setter</i> <i>bona</i> <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> are <i>setter</i> years: the dream is <i>una</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>setter</i> thin and ill favoured kine that <i>trolled</i> up after them are <i>setter</i> years; and the <i>setter</i> empty <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> blasted with the east wind shall be <i>setter</i> years of <i>nix munjarlee</i>.
</li>
<li>This is the <i>fakement</i> which I have <i>cackled</i> unto Pharaoh: What <i>Gloria</i> is about to do <i>she</i> sheweth unto Pharaoh.
</li>
<li><i>Varda</i>, there <i>troll</i> <i>setter</i> years of <i>dowry</i> plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:
</li>
<li>And there shall arise after them <i>setter</i> years of <i>nix munjarlee</i>; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the <i>nix munjarlee</i> shall consume the land;
</li>
<li>And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that <i>nix munjarlee</i> following; for it shall be <i>dowry</i> <i>naff</i>.
</li>
<li>And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the <i>fakement</i> is established by <i>Gloria</i>, and <i>Gloria</i> will shortly <i>parker</i> it to pass.
</li>
<li>Now therefore let Pharaoh <i>varda</i> out a <i>homie</i> discreet and wise, and set <i>her</i> over the land of Egypt.
</li>
<li>Let Pharaoh do this, and let <i>her</i> appoint <i>hilda handcuffs</i> over the land, and <i>lell</i> up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the <i>setter</i> plenteous years.
</li>
<li>And let them gather all the <i>manjarry</i> of those <i>bona</i> years that <i>troll</i>, and <i>lett</i> up corn under the <i>famble</i> of Pharaoh, and let them keep <i>manjarry</i> in the <i>smokes</i>.
</li>
<li>And that <i>manjarry</i> shall be for store to the land against the <i>setter</i> years of <i>nix munjarlee</i>, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the <i>nix munjarlee</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>fakement</i> was <i>bona</i> in the <i>ogles</i> of Pharaoh, and in the <i>ogles</i> of all <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>.
</li>
<li>And Pharaoh <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>, Can we find such a <i>una</i> as this is, a <i>homie</i> in whom the <i>Fairy</i> of <i>Gloria</i> is?
</li>
<li>And Pharaoh <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Josephine</i>, Forasmuch as <i>Gloria</i> hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:
</li>
<li>Thou shalt be over my <i>lattie</i>, and according unto thy <i>lav</i> shall all my <i>homies and palones</i> be ruled: only in the throne will I be <i>dowrier</i> than thou.
</li>
<li>And Pharaoh <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Josephine</i>, <i>varda</i>, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.
</li>
<li>And Pharaoh <i>lelled</i> off <i>her</i> <i>famble cheat</i> from <i>her</i> <i>famble</i>, and put it upon <i>Josephine</i>&#8216;s <i>famble</i>, and arrayed <i>her</i> in vestures of <i>bona</i> <i>lycra</i>, and put a <i>gelt</i> chain about <i>her</i> neck;
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> made <i>her</i> to ride in the second <i>trundling cheat</i> which <i>she</i> had; and they <i>screeched</i> before <i>her</i>, Bow the knee: and <i>she</i> made <i>her</i> ruler over all the land of Egypt.
</li>
<li>And Pharaoh <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Josephine</i>, I am Pharaoh, and <i>nanti</i> thee shall no <i>homie</i> lift up <i>her</i> <i>famble</i> or <i>plate</i> in all the land of Egypt.
</li>
<li>And Pharaoh <i>screeched</i> <i>Josephine</i>&#8216;s name Zaphnathpaaneah; and <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> <i>her</i> to <i>palone affair</i> Asenath the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Potipherah <i>godly homie</i> of On. And <i>Josephine</i> <i>trolled</i> out over all the land of Egypt.

<li>And in the <i>setter</i> plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> gathered up all the <i>manjarry</i> of the <i>setter</i> years, which were in the land of Egypt, and <i>laued</i> up the <i>manjarry</i> in the <i>smokes</i>: the <i>manjarry</i> of the field, which was round about every <i>smoke</i>, <i>laued</i> <i>she</i> up in the same.
</li>
<li>And <i>Josephine</i> gathered corn as the sand of the sea, <i>dowry</i> <i>dowry</i>, until <i>she</i> <i>dry</i> numbering; for it was <i>nanti</i> number.

<li>And unto <i>Josephine</i> were born <i>dewey</i> <i>homie chavvies</i> before the years of <i>nix munjarlee</i> <i>trolled</i>, which Asenath the <i>palone chavvie</i> of Potipherah <i>godly homie</i> of On bare unto <i>her</i>.

<li>And the name of the second <i>screeched</i> <i>she</i> Ephraim: For <i>Gloria</i> hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.

<li>And the <i>setter</i> years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.
</li>
<li>And the <i>setter</i> years of dearth began to <i>troll</i>, according as <i>Josephine</i> had <i>cackled</i>: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was <i>pannan</i>.
</li>
<li>And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the <i>homies and palones</i> <i>screeched</i> to Pharaoh for <i>pannan</i>: and Pharaoh <i>cackled</i> unto all the Egyptians, <i>troll</i> unto <i>Josephine</i>; what <i>she</i> <i>cackleth</i> to you, do.
</li>
<li>And the <i>nix munjarlee</i> was over all the <i>eke</i> of the earth: and <i>Josephine</i> opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the <i>nix munjarlee</i> waxed sore in the land of Egypt.

<h2>Chapter 42</h2>

<li>And <i>Josephine</i>&#8216;s <i>dacha</i> <i>sisters</i> <i>trolled</i> down to buy corn in Egypt.

<li>And the <i>homie chavvies</i> of Israel <i>trolled</i> to buy corn among those that <i>trolled</i>: for the <i>nix munjarlee</i> was in the land of Canaan.

<li>And <i>Josephine</i> knew <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, but they knew not <i>her</i>.

<li>And Reuben answered them, <i>cackling</i>, <i>cackled</i> I not unto you, <i>cackling</i>, <i>nix</i> <i>kertever</i> against the <i>chavvie</i>; and ye would not <i>aunt nell</i>? therefore, <i>varda</i>, also <i>her</i> blood is required.

<li>And as <i>una</i> of them opened <i>her</i> <i>handbag</i> to <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> ass provender in the inn, <i>she</i> espied <i>her</i> <i>dinarly</i>; for, <i>varda</i>, it was in <i>her</i> <i>handbag</i>&#8216;s <i>screech</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, My <i>dinarly</i> is restored; and, lo, it is even in my <i>handbag</i>: and their <i>thumping cheat</i> failed them, and they were afraid, <i>cackling</i> <i>una</i> to another, What is this that <i>Gloria</i> hath done unto us?
</li>
<li>And they <i>trolled</i> unto Jacob their <i>Auntie</i> unto the land of Canaan, and <i>cackled</i> <i>her</i> all that befell unto them; <i>cackling</i>,
</li>
<li>The <i>homie</i>, who is the <i>Duchess</i> of the land, <i>cackled</i> roughly to us, and <i>lelled</i> us for spies of the country.
</li>
<li>And we <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, We are true <i>homies</i>; we are no spies:
</li>
<li>We be <i>kenza</i> <i>sisters</i>, <i>homie chavvies</i> of our <i>Auntie</i>; <i>una</i> is not, and the youngest is this <i>journo</i> with our <i>Auntie</i> in the land of Canaan.
</li>
<li>And the <i>homie</i>, the <i>Duchess</i> of the country, <i>cackled</i> unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true <i>homies</i>; leave <i>una</i> of your <i>sisters</i> here with me, and <i>lell</i> <i>manjarry</i> for the <i>nix munjarlee</i> of your households, and be <i>trolled</i>:
</li>
<li>And <i>parker</i> your youngest <i>sister</i> unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true <i>homies</i>: so will I deliver you your <i>sister</i>, and ye shall traffick in the land.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i> as they emptied their sacks, that, <i>varda</i>, every <i>homie</i>&#8216;s bundle of <i>dinarly</i> was in <i>her</i> <i>handbag</i>: and when both they and their <i>Auntie</i> <i>vardad</i> the bundles of <i>dinarly</i>, they were afraid.
</li>
<li>And Jacob their <i>Auntie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my <i>chavvies</i>: <i>Josephine</i> is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will <i>lell</i> Benjamin away: all these <i>fakements</i> are against me.
</li>
<li>And Reuben <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>ferricadooza</i> my <i>dewey</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>, if I <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> not to thee: deliver <i>her</i> into my <i>famble</i>, and I will <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> to thee again.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, My <i>homie chavvie</i> shall not <i>troll</i> down with you; for <i>her</i> <i>sister</i> is <i>stiff</i>, and <i>she</i> is <i>dry</i> alone: if mischief befall <i>her</i> by the way in the which ye <i>troll</i>, then shall ye <i>parker</i> down my gray <i>riah</i> with <i>sharda</i> to the grave.

<li>And the <i>nix munjarlee</i> was sore in the land.

<li><i>Any road up</i>, when they had <i>jarried</i> up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their <i>Auntie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>troll</i> again, buy us a <i>bijou</i> <i>manjarry</i>.

<li>And Judah <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, <i>cackling</i>, The <i>homie</i> did solemnly protest unto us, <i>cackling</i>, <i>nanti</i> <i>varda</i> my <i>eke</i>, except your <i>sister</i> be with you.
</li>
<li>If thou wilt <i>lau</i> our <i>sister</i> with us, we will <i>troll</i> down and buy thee <i>manjarry</i>:

<li>But if thou wilt not <i>lau</i> <i>her</i>, we will not <i>troll</i> down: for the <i>homie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto us, <i>nanti</i> <i>varda</i> my <i>eke</i>, except your <i>sister</i> be with you.
</li>
<li>And Israel <i>cackled</i>, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to <i>cackle</i> the <i>homie</i> whether ye had yet a <i>sister</i>?
</li>
<li>And they <i>cackled</i>, The <i>homie</i> asked us <i>hettily</i> of our state, and of our kindred, <i>cackling</i>, Is your <i>Auntie</i> yet alive? have ye another <i>sister</i>? and we <i>cackled</i> <i>her</i> according to the tenor of these <i>lavs</i>: could we <i>mais oui</i> know that <i>she</i> would <i>cackle</i>, <i>parker</i> your <i>sister</i> down?
</li>
<li>And Judah <i>cackled</i> unto Israel <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, <i>lau</i> the <i>bean cove</i> with me, and we will arise and <i>troll</i>; that we may live, and not <i>cark it</i>, both we, and thou, and also our <i>bijou</i> ones.
</li>
<li>I will be surety for <i>her</i>; of my <i>famble</i> shalt thou require <i>her</i>: if I <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> not unto thee, and set <i>her</i> before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:
</li>
<li>For except we had lingered, surely now we had <i>trolled back</i> this second time.
</li>
<li>And their <i>Auntie</i> Israel <i>cackled</i> unto them, If it must be so now, do this; <i>lell</i> of the best fruits in the land in your <i>fakements</i>, and carry down the <i>homie</i> a present, a <i>bijou</i> balm, and a <i>bijou</i> honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:
</li>
<li>And <i>lell</i> double <i>dinarly</i> in your <i>famble</i>; and the <i>dinarly</i> that was brought again in the <i>screech</i> of your sacks, carry it again in your <i>famble</i>; peradventure it was an oversight:
</li>
<li><i>Lell</i> also your <i>sister</i>, and arise, <i>troll</i> again unto the <i>homie</i>:
</li>
<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>Dowry butch</i> <i>parker</i> you mercy before the <i>homie</i>, that <i>she</i> may <i>lau</i> away your other <i>sister</i>, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my <i>chavvies</i>, I am bereaved.
</li>
<li>And the <i>homies</i> <i>lelled</i> that present, and they <i>lelled</i> double <i>dinarly</i> in their <i>famble</i> and Benjamin; and rose up, and <i>trolled</i> down to Egypt, and stood before <i>Josephine</i>.
</li>
<li>And when <i>Josephine</i> <i>vardad</i> Benjamin with them, <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> to the ruler of <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>, <i>parker</i> these <i>homies</i> home, and <i>ferricadooza</i>, and make ready; for these <i>homies</i> shall dine with me at noon.
</li>
<li>And the <i>homie</i> did as <i>Josephine</i> bade; and the <i>homie</i> brought the <i>homies</i> into <i>Josephine</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>.
</li>
<li>And the <i>homies</i> were afraid, because they were brought into <i>Josephine</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>; and they <i>cackled</i>, Because of the <i>dinarly</i> that was <i>trolled back</i> in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that <i>she</i> may <i>charper</i> occasion against us, and fall upon us, and <i>lell</i> us for bondmen, and our asses.
</li>
<li>And they <i>trolled</i> near to the steward of <i>Josephine</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, and they <i>dished the dirt</i> with <i>her</i> at the door of the <i>lattie</i>,
</li>
<li>And <i>cackled</i>, O sir, we <i>trolled</i> indeed down at the first time to buy <i>manjarry</i>:
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i>, when we <i>trolled</i> to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, <i>varda</i>, every <i>homie</i>&#8216;s <i>dinarly</i> was in the <i>screech</i> of <i>her</i> <i>handbag</i>, our <i>dinarly</i> in full weight: and we have brought it again in our <i>famble</i>.
</li>
<li>And other <i>dinarly</i> have we brought down in our <i>fambles</i> to buy <i>manjarry</i>: we cannot <i>cackle</i> who put our <i>dinarly</i> in our sacks.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Peace be to you, fear not: your <i>Gloria</i>, and the <i>Gloria</i> of your <i>Auntie</i>, hath <i>parkered</i> you <i>gelt</i> in your sacks: I had your <i>dinarly</i>. And <i>she</i> brought Simeon out unto them.
</li>
<li>And the <i>homie</i> brought the <i>homies</i> into <i>Josephine</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>, and <i>parkered</i> them <i>aqua</i>, and they <i>dhobied</i> their <i>plates</i>; and <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> their asses provender.
</li>
<li>And they made ready the present against <i>Josephine</i> <i>trolled</i> at noon: for they <i>aunt nelled</i> that they should <i>jarry</i> <i>pannan</i> there.
</li>
<li>And when <i>Josephine</i> <i>trolled</i> home, they brought <i>her</i> the present which was in their <i>famble</i> into the <i>lattie</i>, and bowed themselves to <i>her</i> to the earth.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> asked them of their welfare, and <i>cackled</i>, Is your <i>Auntie</i> well, the <i>badge cove</i> of whom ye <i>cackled</i>? Is <i>she</i> yet alive?
</li>
<li>And they answered, Thy <i>serving homie</i> our <i>Auntie</i> is in <i>bona</i> health, <i>she</i> is yet alive. And they bowed down their <i>ekes</i>, and made obeisance.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> lifted up <i>her</i> <i>ogles</i>, and <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i> <i>sister</i> Benjamin, <i>her</i> mother&#8217;s <i>homie chavvie</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Is this your younger <i>sister</i>, of whom ye <i>cackled</i> unto me? And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>Gloria</i> be <i>bona</i> unto thee, my <i>homie chavvie</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>Josephine</i> made haste; for <i>her</i> <i>chutney locker</i> did yearn upon <i>her</i> <i>sister</i>: and <i>she</i> sought where to <i>parnie</i>; and <i>she</i> entered into <i>her</i> <i>booth</i>, and <i>parnied</i> there.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>dhobied</i> <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>, and <i>trolled</i> out, and refrained himself, and <i>cackled</i>, Set on <i>pannan</i>.
</li>
<li>And they set on for <i>her</i> by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did <i>jarry</i> with <i>her</i>, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not <i>jarry</i> <i>pannan</i> with the <i>Kosher Homies and Palones</i>; for that is <i>a dowriest cod</i> unto the Egyptians.
</li>
<li>And they sat before <i>her</i>, the firstborn according to <i>her</i> birthright, and the youngest according to <i>her</i> <i>beandom</i>: and the <i>homies</i> marvelled <i>una</i> at another.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> and <i>laued</i> messes unto them from before <i>her</i>: but Benjamin&#8217;s mess was <i>chinker</i> times so <i>dowry</i> as any of their&#8217;s. And they drank, and were merry with <i>her</i>.

</ol>
<h2>Chapter 44</h2>
<ol>
<li>And <i>she</i> commanded the steward of <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Fill the <i>homies</i>&#8216;s sacks with <i>manjarry</i>, as <i>dowry</i> as they can carry, and put every <i>homie</i>&#8216;s <i>dinarly</i> in <i>her</i> <i>handbag</i>&#8216;s <i>screech</i>.
</li>
<li>And put my cup, the silver cup, in the <i>handbag</i>&#8216;s <i>screech</i> of the youngest, and <i>her</i> corn <i>dinarly</i>. And <i>she</i> did according to the <i>lav</i> that <i>Josephine</i> had <i>cackled</i>.
</li>
<li>As soon as the morning was <i>sparkle</i>, the <i>homies</i> were <i>laued</i> away, they and their asses.
</li>
<li>And when they were <i>trolled</i> out of the <i>smoke</i>, and not yet far off, <i>Josephine</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> steward, Up, <i>troll after</i> after the <i>homies</i>; and when thou dost overtake them, <i>cackle</i> unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded <i>nana</i> for <i>bona</i>?
</li>
<li>Is not this it in which my <i>Duchess</i> <i>buvareth</i>, and whereby indeed <i>she</i> divineth? ye have done <i>nana</i> in so doing.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> overtook them, and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them these same <i>lavs</i>.
</li>
<li>And they <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, Wherefore <i>cackleth</i> my <i>Duchess</i> these <i>lavs</i>? <i>Gloria</i> forbid that thy <i>serving homies</i> should do according to this <i>fakement</i>:
</li>
<li><i>Varda</i>, the <i>dinarly</i>, which we found in our sacks&#8217; <i>screeches</i>, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we <i>sharper</i> out of thy <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i> silver or <i>gelt</i>?
</li>
<li>With whomsoever of thy <i>serving homies</i> it be found, both let <i>her</i> <i>cark it</i>, and we also will be my <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s bondmen.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Now also let it be according unto your <i>lavs</i>: <i>she</i> with whom it is found shall be my <i>serving homie</i>; and ye shall be blameless.
</li>
<li>Then they speedily <i>lelled</i> down every <i>homie</i> <i>her</i> <i>handbag</i> to the ground, and opened every <i>homie</i> <i>her</i> <i>handbag</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> searched, and began at the eldest, and <i>dry</i> at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin&#8217;s <i>handbag</i>.
</li>
<li>Then they rent their <i>zhoosh</i>, and laded every <i>homie</i> <i>her</i> ass, and <i>trolled back to</i> the <i>smoke</i>.
</li>
<li>And Judah and <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i> <i>trolled</i> to <i>Josephine</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>; for <i>she</i> was yet there: and they fell before <i>her</i> on the ground.
</li>
<li>And <i>Josephine</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a <i>homie</i> as I can <i>mais oui</i> divine?
</li>
<li>And Judah <i>cackled</i>, What shall we <i>cackle</i> unto my <i>Duchess</i>? what shall we <i>cackle</i>? or how shall we clear ourselves? <i>Gloria</i> hath found out the <i>codness</i> of thy <i>serving homies</i>: <i>varda</i>, we are my <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s <i>serving homies</i>, both we, and <i>she</i> also with whom the cup is found.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>Gloria</i> forbid that I should do so: but the <i>homie</i> in whose <i>famble</i> the cup is found, <i>she</i> shall be my <i>serving homie</i>; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your <i>Auntie</i>.
</li>
<li>Then Judah <i>trolled</i> near unto <i>her</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Oh my <i>Duchess</i>, let thy <i>serving homie</i>, I pray thee, <i>cackle</i> a <i>lav</i> in my <i>Duchess</i>&#8216;s <i>aunt nelly cheats</i>, and let not thine <i>wild</i> burn against thy <i>serving homie</i>: for thou art even as Pharaoh.
</li>
<li>My <i>Duchess</i> asked <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Have ye a <i>Auntie</i>, or a <i>sister</i>?
</li>
<li>And we <i>cackled</i> unto my <i>Duchess</i>, We have a <i>Auntie</i>, an <i>badge cove</i>, and a <i>chavvie</i> of <i>her</i> <i>badgeness</i>, a <i>bijou</i> <i>una</i>; and <i>her</i> <i>sister</i> is <i>stiff</i>, and <i>she</i> alone is <i>dry</i> of <i>her</i> mother, and <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> loveth <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And thou saidst unto thy <i>serving homies</i>, <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> down unto me, that I may set mine <i>ogles</i> upon <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And we <i>cackled</i> unto my <i>Duchess</i>, The <i>bean cove</i> cannot leave <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>: for if <i>she</i> should leave <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> would <i>cark it</i>.
</li>
<li>And thou saidst unto thy <i>serving homies</i>, Except your youngest <i>sister</i> <i>troll</i> down with you, ye shall <i>varda</i> my <i>eke</i> <i>nishta</i>.
</li>
<li><i>Any road up</i> when we <i>trolled</i> up unto thy <i>serving homie</i> my <i>Auntie</i>, we <i>cackled</i> <i>her</i> the <i>lavs</i> of my <i>Duchess</i>.
</li>
<li>And our <i>Auntie</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>troll</i> again, and buy us a <i>bijou</i> <i>manjarry</i>.
</li>
<li>And we <i>cackled</i>, We cannot <i>troll</i> down: if our youngest <i>sister</i> be with us, then will we <i>troll</i> down: for we may not <i>varda</i> the <i>homie</i>&#8216;s <i>eke</i>, except our youngest <i>sister</i> be with us.
</li>
<li>And thy <i>serving homie</i> my <i>Auntie</i> <i>cackled</i> unto us, Ye know that my <i>palone affair</i> bare me <i>dewey</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>:
</li>
<li>And the <i>una</i> <i>trolled</i> out from me, and I <i>cackled</i>, Surely <i>she</i> is torn in pieces; and I <i>vardad</i> <i>her</i> not since:
</li>
<li>And if ye <i>lell</i> this also from me, and mischief befall <i>her</i>, ye shall <i>parker</i> down my gray <i>riah</i> with <i>sharda</i> to the grave.
</li>
<li>Now therefore when I <i>troll</i> to thy <i>serving homie</i> my <i>Auntie</i>, and the <i>bean cove</i> be not with us; <i>vardaing</i> that <i>her</i> life is bound up in the <i>bean cove</i>&#8216;s life;
</li>
<li>It shall <i>troll</i> to pass, when <i>she</i> <i>vardaeth</i> that the <i>bean cove</i> is not with us, that <i>she</i> will <i>cark it</i>: and thy <i>serving homies</i> shall <i>parker</i> down the gray <i>riah</i> of thy <i>serving homie</i> our <i>Auntie</i> with <i>sharda</i> to the grave.
</li>
<li>For thy <i>serving homie</i> became surety for the <i>bean cove</i> unto my <i>Auntie</i>, <i>cackling</i>, If I <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my <i>Auntie</i> for ever.
</li>
<li>Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy <i>serving homie</i> <i>lett</i> instead of the <i>bean cove</i> a <i>bond homie</i> to my <i>Duchess</i>; and let the <i>bean cove</i> <i>troll</i> up with <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>.
</li>
<li>For how shall I <i>troll</i> up to my <i>Auntie</i>, and the <i>bean cove</i> be not with me? lest peradventure I <i>varda</i> the <i>nana</i> that shall <i>troll</i> on my <i>Auntie</i>.

<h2>Chapter 45</h2>

<li>Then <i>Josephine</i> could not refrain himself before all them that stood by <i>her</i>; and <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i>, Cause every <i>homie</i> to <i>troll out</i> from me. And there stood no <i>homie</i> with <i>her</i>, while <i>Josephine</i> made himself known unto <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>.

<li>And <i>she</i> <i>parnied</i> aloud: and the Egyptians and the <i>lattie</i> of Pharaoh <i>aunt nelled</i>.

<li>And <i>Josephine</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, I am <i>Josephine</i>; doth my <i>Auntie</i> yet live? And <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i> could not answer <i>her</i>; for they were troubled at <i>her</i> presence.
</li>
<li>And <i>Josephine</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, <i>troll</i> near to me, I pray you. And they <i>trolled</i> near. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, I am <i>Josephine</i> your <i>sister</i>, whom ye sold into Egypt.
</li>
<li>Now therefore be not grieved, <i>nishta</i> angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for <i>Gloria</i> did <i>lau</i> me before you to preserve life.
</li>
<li>For these <i>dewey</i> years hath the <i>nix munjarlee</i> been in the land: and yet there are <i>chinker</i> years, in the which there shall <i>nishta</i> be earing <i>nishta</i> harvest.

<li>And <i>Gloria</i> <i>laued</i> me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a <i>dowry</i> deliverance.
</li>
<li>So now it was not you that <i>laued</i> me hither, but <i>Gloria</i>: and <i>she</i> hath made me a <i>Auntie</i> to Pharaoh, and <i>Duchess</i> of all <i>her</i> <i>lattie</i>, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.
</li>
<li>Haste ye, and <i>troll</i> up to my <i>Auntie</i>, and <i>cackle</i> unto <i>her</i>, Thus <i>cackleth</i> thy <i>homie chavvie</i> <i>Josephine</i>, <i>Gloria</i> hath made me <i>Duchess</i> of all Egypt: <i>troll</i> down unto me, tarry not:

<li>And thou shalt <i>lett</i> in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy <i>chavvies</i>, and thy <i>chavvies</i>&#8216;s <i>chavvies</i>, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:

<li>And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are <i>chinker</i> years of <i>nix munjarlee</i>; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, <i>troll</i> to <i>nishta dinarly</i>.
</li>
<li>And, <i>varda</i>, your <i>ogles</i> <i>varda</i>, and the <i>ogles</i> of my <i>sister</i> Benjamin, that it is my <i>screech</i> that <i>cackleth</i> unto you.
</li>
<li>And ye shall <i>cackle</i> my <i>Auntie</i> of all my <i>fabeness</i> in Egypt, and of all that ye have <i>vardad</i>; and ye shall haste and <i>parker</i> down my <i>Auntie</i> hither.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> fell upon <i>her</i> <i>sister</i> Benjamin&#8217;s neck, and <i>parnied</i>; and Benjamin <i>parnied</i> upon <i>her</i> neck.
</li>
<li>Moreover <i>she</i> kissed all <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, and <i>parnied</i> upon them: and after that <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i> talked with <i>her</i>.

<li>And the fame thereof was <i>aunt nelled</i> in Pharaoh&#8217;s <i>lattie</i>, <i>cackling</i>, <i>Josephine</i>&#8216;s <i>sisters</i> are <i>troll</i>: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and <i>her</i> <i>serving homies</i>.

<li>And Pharaoh <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Josephine</i>, <i>cackle</i> unto thy <i>sisters</i>, This do ye; lade your beasts, and <i>troll</i>, get you unto the land of Canaan;

<li>And <i>lell</i> your <i>Auntie</i> and your households, and <i>troll</i> unto me: and I will <i>parker</i> you the <i>bona</i> of the land of Egypt, and ye shall <i>jarry</i> the fat of the land.

<li>Now thou art commanded, this do ye; <i>lell</i> you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your <i>bijou</i> ones, and for your <i>palone affairs</i>, and <i>parker</i> your <i>Auntie</i>, and <i>troll</i>.
</li>
<li>Also regard not your stuff; for the <i>bona</i> of all the land of Egypt is your&#8217;s.
</li>
<li>And the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel did so: and <i>Josephine</i> <i>parkered</i> them wagons, according to the <i>butch lav</i> of Pharaoh, and <i>parkered</i> them provision for the way.
</li>
<li>To all of them <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> each <i>homie</i> changes of <i>clobber</i>; but to Benjamin <i>she</i> <i>parkered</i> <i>trey</i> <i>chenter</i> pieces of silver, and <i>chinker</i> changes of <i>clobber</i>.

<li>And to <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> after this manner; <i>dacha</i> asses laden with the <i>bona</i> <i>fakements</i> of Egypt, and <i>dacha</i> she asses laden with corn and <i>pannan</i> and <i>carnish</i> for <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> by the way.

<li>So <i>she</i> <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i> away, and they <i>trolled off</i>: and <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, <i>varda</i> that ye fall not out by the way.

</li>
<li>And they <i>cackled</i> <i>her</i> all the <i>lavs</i> of <i>Josephine</i>, which <i>she</i> had <i>cackled</i> unto them: and when <i>she</i> <i>vardad</i> the wagons which <i>Josephine</i> had <i>laued</i> to carry <i>her</i>, the <i>Fairy</i> of Jacob their <i>Auntie</i> revived:

<li>And Israel <i>cackled</i>, It is enough; <i>Josephine</i> my <i>homie chavvie</i> is yet alive: I will <i>troll</i> and <i>varda</i> <i>her</i> before I <i>cark it</i>.

<h2>Chapter 47</h2>
<ol>
<li>Then <i>Josephine</i> <i>trolled</i> and <i>cackled</i> Pharaoh, and <i>cackled</i>, My <i>Auntie</i> and my <i>sisters</i>, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are <i>troll</i> out of the land of Canaan; and, <i>varda</i>, they are in the land of Goshen.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> some of <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, even <i>chinker</i> <i>homies</i>, and presented them unto Pharaoh.
</li>
<li>And Pharaoh <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, What is your occupation? And they <i>cackled</i> unto Pharaoh, Thy <i>serving homies</i> are shepherds, both we, and also our <i>aunties</i>.
</li>
<li>They <i>cackled</i> morever unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we <i>troll</i>; for thy <i>serving homies</i> have no pasture for their flocks; for the <i>nix munjarlee</i> is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy <i>serving homies</i> <i>lett</i> in the land of Goshen.
</li>
<li>And Pharaoh <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Josephine</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Thy <i>Auntie</i> and thy <i>sisters</i> are <i>troll</i> unto thee:
</li>
<li>The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy <i>Auntie</i> and <i>sisters</i> to <i>lett</i>; in the land of Goshen let them <i>lett</i>: and if thou knowest any <i>homies</i> of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.
</li>
<li>And <i>Josephine</i> brought in Jacob <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, and set <i>her</i> before Pharaoh: and Jacob <i>fabed</i> Pharaoh.
</li>
<li>And Pharaoh <i>cackled</i> unto Jacob, How <i>badge</i> art thou?
</li>
<li>And Jacob <i>cackled</i> unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an <i>chenter</i> and <i>trey dacha</i> years: <i>nishta dowry</i> and <i>nana</i> have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my <i>aunties</i> in the days of their pilgrimage.
</li>
<li>And Jacob <i>fabed</i> Pharaoh, and <i>trolled</i> out from before Pharaoh.
</li>
<li>And <i>Josephine</i> placed <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> and <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, and <i>parkered</i> them a <i>fakement</i> in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
</li>
<li>And <i>Josephine</i> nourished <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, and all <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s household, with <i>pannan</i>, according to their families.
</li>
<li>And there was no <i>pannan</i> in all the land; for the <i>nix munjarlee</i> was <i>dowry</i> sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the <i>nix munjarlee</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>Josephine</i> gathered up all the <i>dinarly</i> that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and <i>Josephine</i> brought the <i>dinarly</i> into Pharaoh&#8217;s <i>lattie</i>.
</li>
<li>And when <i>dinarly</i> failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians <i>trolled</i> unto <i>Josephine</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>parker</i> us <i>pannan</i>: for why should we <i>cark it</i> in thy presence? for the <i>dinarly</i> faileth.
</li>
<li>And <i>Josephine</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>parker</i> your cattle; and I will <i>parker</i> you for your cattle, if <i>dinarly</i> fail.
</li>
<li>And they brought their cattle unto <i>Josephine</i>: and <i>Josephine</i> <i>parkered</i> them <i>pannan</i> in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and <i>she</i> fed them with <i>pannan</i> for all their cattle for that year.
</li>
<li>When that year was ended, they <i>trolled</i> unto <i>her</i> the second year, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, We will not hide it from my <i>Duchess</i>, how that our <i>dinarly</i> is spent; my <i>Duchess</i> also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought <i>dry</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of my <i>Duchess</i>, but our bodies, and our lands:
</li>
<li>Wherefore shall we <i>cark it</i> before thine <i>ogles</i>, both we and our land? buy us and our land for <i>pannan</i>, and we and our land will be <i>serving homies</i> unto Pharaoh: and <i>parker</i> us <i>maria</i>, that we may live, and not <i>cark it</i>, that the land be not desolate.
</li>
<li>And <i>Josephine</i> bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every <i>homie</i> <i>her</i> field, because the <i>nix munjarlee</i> prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh&#8217;s.
</li>
<li>And as for the <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>she</i> removed them to <i>smokes</i> from <i>una</i> end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.
</li>
<li>Only the land of the <i>godly homies</i> bought <i>she</i> not; for the <i>godly homies</i> had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did <i>jarry</i> their portion which Pharaoh <i>parkered</i> them: wherefore they sold not their lands.
</li>
<li>Then <i>Josephine</i> <i>cackled</i> unto the <i>homies and palones</i>, <i>varda</i>, I have bought you this <i>journo</i> and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is <i>maria</i> for you, and ye shall sow the land.
</li>
<li>And it shall <i>troll</i> to pass in the increase, that ye shall <i>parker</i> the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and <i>quarter</i> parts shall be your own, for <i>maria</i> of the field, and for your <i>manjarry</i>, and for them of your households, and for <i>manjarry</i> for your <i>bijou</i> ones.
</li>
<li>And they <i>cackled</i>, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find <i>gracie</i> in the <i>vardaing</i> of my <i>Duchess</i>, and we will be Pharaoh&#8217;s <i>serving homies</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>Josephine</i> made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this <i>journo</i>, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of the <i>godly homies</i> only, which became not Pharaoh&#8217;s.
</li>
<li>And Israel <i>letted</i> in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.
</li>
<li>And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was an <i>chenter</i> <i>quarter dacha</i> and <i>setter</i> years.
</li>
<li>And the time drew <i>ajax</i> that Israel must <i>cark it</i>: and <i>she</i> <i>screeched</i> <i>her</i> <i>homie chavvie</i> <i>Josephine</i>, and <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>, If now I have found <i>gracie</i> in thy <i>vardaing</i>, put, I pray thee, thy <i>famble</i> under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:
</li>
<li>But I will lie with my <i>aunties</i>, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, I will do as thou hast <i>cackled</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, Swear unto me. And <i>she</i> sware unto <i>her</i>. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed&#8217;s <i>eke</i>.

<li><i>Any road up</i> after these <i>fakements</i>, that <i>una</i> <i>cackled</i> <i>Josephine</i>, <i>varda</i>, thy <i>Auntie</i> is sick: and <i>she</i> <i>lelled</i> with <i>her</i> <i>her</i> <i>dewey</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>, Manasseh and Ephraim.
</li>
<li>And <i>una</i> <i>cackled</i> Jacob, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, thy <i>homie chavvie</i> <i>Josephine</i> <i>trolleth</i> unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.
</li>
<li>And Jacob <i>cackled</i> unto <i>Josephine</i>, <i>Gloria</i> <i>Dowry butch</i> appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and <i>fabed</i> me,
</li>
<li>And <i>cackled</i> unto me, <i>varda</i>, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of <i>homies and palones</i>; and will <i>parker</i> this land to thy <i>maria</i> after thee for an everlasting <i>fakement</i>.
</li>
<li>And now thy <i>dewey</i> <i>homie chavvies</i>, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I <i>trolled</i> unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.

<li>And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be <i>screeched</i> after the name of their <i>sisters</i> in their inheritance.

<li>And as for me, when I <i>trolled</i> from Padan, Rachel <i>carked it</i> by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a <i>bijou</i> way to <i>troll</i> unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.
</li>
<li>And Israel beheld <i>Josephine</i>&#8216;s <i>homie chavvies</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, Who are these?
</li>
<li>And <i>Josephine</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, They are my <i>homie chavvies</i>, whom <i>Gloria</i> hath <i>parkered</i> me in this place. And <i>she</i> <i>cackled</i>, <i>parker</i> them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.
</li>
<li>Now the <i>ogles</i> of Israel were dim for age, so that <i>she</i> could not <i>varda</i>. And <i>she</i> brought them near unto <i>her</i>; and <i>she</i> kissed them, and embraced them.

<li>And <i>Josephine</i> brought them out from between <i>her</i> knees, and <i>she</i> bowed himself with <i>her</i> <i>eke</i> to the earth.

<li>And <i>she</i> <i>fabed</i> <i>Josephine</i>, and <i>cackled</i>, <i>Gloria</i>, before whom my <i>aunties</i> Abraham and Isaac did <i>mince</i>, the <i>Gloria</i> which fed me all my life long unto this <i>journo</i>,

<li>The <i>fairy</i> which redeemed me from all <i>nana</i>, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my <i>aunties</i> Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.

<li>And when <i>Josephine</i> <i>vardad</i> that <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> <i>laued</i> <i>her</i> <i>sweet martini</i> upon the <i>eke</i> of Ephraim, it displeased <i>her</i>: and <i>she</i> held up <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s <i>famble</i>, to remove it from Ephraim&#8217;s <i>eke</i> unto Manasseh&#8217;s <i>eke</i>.

<li>And <i>Josephine</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, Not so, my <i>Auntie</i>: for this is the firstborn; put thy <i>sweet martini</i> upon <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i> refused, and <i>cackled</i>, I know it, my <i>homie chavvie</i>, I know it: <i>she</i> also shall become a <i>homies and palones</i>, and <i>she</i> also shall be <i>dowry</i>: but truly <i>her</i> younger <i>sister</i> shall be <i>dowrier</i> than <i>she</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>maria</i> shall become a multitude of nations.

<li>And <i>Josephine</i> <i>trolled back</i> into Egypt, <i>she</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, and all that <i>trolled</i> up with <i>her</i> to bury <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>, after <i>she</i> had buried <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>.
</li>
<li>And when <i>Josephine</i>&#8216;s <i>sisters</i> <i>vardad</i> that their <i>Auntie</i> was <i>stiff</i>, they <i>cackled</i>, <i>Josephine</i> will peradventure hate us, and will <i>mais oui</i> requite us all the <i>nana</i> which we did unto <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And they <i>laued</i> a messenger unto <i>Josephine</i>, <i>cackling</i>, Thy <i>Auntie</i> did command before <i>she</i> <i>carked it</i>, <i>cackling</i>,
</li>
<li>So shall ye <i>cackle</i> unto <i>Josephine</i>, Forgive, I pray thee now, the <i>caterver</i> of thy <i>sisters</i>, and their <i>kertever</i>; for they did unto thee <i>nana</i>: and now, we pray thee, forgive the <i>caterver</i> of the <i>serving homies</i> of the <i>Gloria</i> of thy <i>Auntie</i>. And <i>Josephine</i> <i>parnied</i> when they <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i> also <i>trolled</i> and fell down before <i>her</i> <i>eke</i>; and they <i>cackled</i>, <i>varda</i>, we be thy <i>serving homies</i>.
</li>
<li>And <i>Josephine</i> <i>cackled</i> unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of <i>Gloria</i>?
</li>
<li>But as for you, ye thought <i>nana</i> against me; but <i>Gloria</i> meant it unto <i>bona</i>, to <i>parker</i> to pass, as it is this <i>journo</i>, to save <i>dowry</i> <i>homies and palones</i> alive.
</li>
<li>Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your <i>bijou</i> ones. And <i>she</i> comforted them, and <i>cackled</i> kindly unto them.
</li>
<li>And <i>Josephine</i> <i>letted</i> in Egypt, <i>she</i>, and <i>her</i> <i>Auntie</i>&#8216;s <i>lattie</i>: and <i>Josephine</i> lived an <i>chenter</i> and <i>dacha</i> years.
</li>
<li>And <i>Josephine</i> <i>vardad</i> Ephraim&#8217;s <i>chavvies</i> of the third generation: the <i>chavvies</i> also of Machir the <i>homie chavvie</i> of Manasseh were brought up upon <i>Josephine</i>&#8216;s knees.
</li>
<li>And <i>Josephine</i> <i>cackled</i> unto <i>her</i> <i>sisters</i>, I <i>cark it</i>: and <i>Gloria</i> will surely visit you, and <i>parker</i> you out of this land unto the land which <i>she</i> sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
</li>
<li>And <i>Josephine</i> <i>lelled</i> an oath of the <i>chavvies</i> of Israel, <i>cackling</i>, <i>Gloria</i> will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.
</li>
<li>So <i>Josephine</i> <i>carked it</i>, being an <i>chenter</i> and <i>dacha</i> years <i>badge</i>: and they embalmed <i>her</i>, and <i>she</i> was put in a coffin in Egypt.
