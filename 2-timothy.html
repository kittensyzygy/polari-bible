    <h1>2 Timothy</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Pauline</i>, an apostle of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> by the will of <i>Gloria</i>, according to the promise of life which is in <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i>,
    </li>
    <li>To Timothy, my dearly beloved <i>homie chavvie</i>: <i>gracie</i>, mercy, and peace, from <i>Gloria</i> the <i>Auntie</i> and <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i> our <i>Duchess</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I thank <i>Gloria</i>, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that <i>nanti</i> ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my <i>meshigener mutterings</i> <i>nochy</i> and <i>journo</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Greatly desiring to <i>varda</i> thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;
    </li>
    <li>When I <i>screech</i> to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which <i>letted</i> first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.
    </li>
    <li>Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of <i>Gloria</i>, which is in thee by the putting on of my <i>fambles</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>Gloria</i> hath not <i>parkered</i> us the <i>Fairy</i> of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.
    </li>
    <li>Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our <i>Duchess</i>, <i>nishta</i> of me <i>her</i> prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the <i>gossip</i> according to the power of <i>Gloria</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Who hath saved us, and <i>screeched</i> us with an <i>fabulosa</i> calling, not according to our works, but according to <i>her</i> own purpose and <i>gracie</i>, which was <i>parkered</i> us in <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i> before the world began,
    </li>
    <li>But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, who hath abolished <i>carking it</i>, and hath brought life and immortality to <i>sparkle</i> through the <i>gossip</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Whereunto I am appointed a <i>cackling homie</i>, and an apostle, and a teacher of the <i>nishta kosher homies</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For the which cause I also suffer these <i>fakements</i>: <i>any road up</i> I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that <i>she</i> is able to keep that which I have committed unto <i>her</i> against that <i>journo</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Hold <i>nishta manjarry</i> the form of sound <i>lavs</i>, which thou hast <i>aunt nelled</i> of me, in faith and love which is in <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>That <i>bona</i> <i>fakement</i> which was committed unto thee keep by the <i>Fantabulosa Fairy</i> which <i>letteth</i> in us.
    </li>
    <li>This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> <i>parker</i> mercy unto the <i>lattie</i> of Onesiphorus; for <i>she</i> oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:
    </li>
    <li>But, when <i>she</i> was in Rome, <i>she</i> sought me out <i>dowry</i> diligently, and found me.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> grant unto <i>her</i> that <i>she</i> may find mercy of the <i>Duchess</i> in that <i>journo</i>: and in how many <i>fakements</i> <i>she</i> ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest <i>dowry</i> well.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Thou therefore, my <i>homie chavvie</i>, be <i>butch</i> in the <i>gracie</i> that is in <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>fakements</i> that thou hast <i>aunt nelled</i> of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to <i>fabulous</i> <i>homies</i>, who shall be able to teach others also.
    </li>
    <li>Thou therefore endure hardness, as a <i>bona</i> <i>butch homie</i> of <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>.
    </li>
    <li>No <i>homie</i> that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that <i>she</i> may please <i>her</i> who hath chosen <i>her</i> to be a <i>butch homie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>And if a <i>homie</i> also strive for masteries, yet is <i>she</i> not crowned, except <i>she</i> strive lawfully.
    </li>
    <li>The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.
    </li>
    <li>Consider what I <i>cackle</i>; and the <i>Duchess</i> <i>parker</i> thee understanding in all <i>fakements</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Remember that <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> of the <i>maria</i> of <i>Davina</i> was raised from the <i>stiff</i> according to my <i>gossip</i>:
    </li>
    <li>Wherein I suffer trouble, as an <i>nana</i> doer, even unto bonds; but the <i>lav</i> of <i>Gloria</i> is not bound.
    </li>
    <li>Therefore I endure all <i>fakements</i> for the elect&#8217;s sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i> with eternal <i>fabeness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>It is a <i>fabulous</i> <i>cackling</i>: For if we be <i>stiff</i> with <i>her</i>, we shall also live with <i>her</i>:
    </li>
    <li>If we suffer, we shall also reign with <i>her</i>: if we deny <i>her</i>, <i>she</i> also will deny us:
    </li>
    <li>If we believe not, yet <i>she</i> <i>letteth</i> <i>fabulous</i>: <i>she</i> cannot deny himself.
    </li>
    <li>Of these <i>fakements</i> put them in remembrance, charging them before the <i>Duchess</i> that they strive not about <i>lavs</i> to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.
    </li>
    <li>Study to shew thyself approved unto <i>Gloria</i>, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the <i>lav</i> of truth.
    </li>
    <li>But shun <i>billingsgate</i> and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.
    </li>
    <li>And their <i>lav</i> will <i>jarry</i> as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;
    </li>
    <li>Who concerning the truth have erred, <i>cackling</i> that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i> the foundation of <i>Gloria</i> standeth sure, having this seal, The <i>Duchess</i> knoweth them that are <i>her</i>. And, Let every <i>una</i> that nameth the name of <i>Crystal</i> <i>troll off</i> from <i>codness</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But in a <i>dowry</i> <i>lattie</i> there are not only <i>fakements</i> of <i>gelt</i> and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.
    </li>
    <li>If a <i>homie</i> therefore purge himself from these, <i>she</i> shall be a <i>fakement</i> unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master&#8217;s use, and prepared unto every <i>bona</i> <i>acting dickey</i>.
    </li>
    <li><i>Scarper</i> also youthful lusts: but <i>troll after</i> <i>bonaness</i>, faith, charity, peace, with them that <i>screech</i> on the <i>Duchess</i> out of a pure <i>thumping cheat</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>dizzy</i> and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>serving homie</i> of the <i>Duchess</i> must not strive; but be gentle unto all <i>homies</i>, apt to teach, patient,
    </li>
    <li>In <i>campness</i> instructing those that oppose themselves; if <i>Gloria</i> peradventure will <i>parker</i> them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;
    </li>
    <li>And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are <i>lelled</i> captive by <i>her</i> at <i>her</i> will.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall <i>troll</i>.
    </li>
    <li>For <i>homies</i> shall be <i>affairs</i> of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, <i>nanna</i>,
    </li>
    <li><i>Nanti</i> natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are <i>bona</i>,
    </li>
    <li>Traitors, heady, highminded, <i>affairs</i> of pleasures more than <i>affairs</i> of <i>Gloria</i>;
    </li>
    <li>Having a form of <i>fabeness</i>, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.
    </li>
    <li>For of this sort are they which creep into <i>latties</i>, and lead captive silly <i>palones</i> laden with <i>kertervers</i>, led away with divers lusts,
    </li>
    <li>Ever learning, and never able to <i>troll</i> to the knowledge of the truth.
    </li>
    <li>Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood <i>Maureen</i>, so do these also resist the truth: <i>homies</i> of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.
    </li>
    <li>But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all <i>homies</i>, as their&#8217;s also was.
    </li>
    <li>But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,
    </li>
    <li>Persecutions, afflictions, which <i>trolled</i> unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the <i>Duchess</i> <i>laued</i> me.
    </li>
    <li><i>Any road up</i>, and all that will live <i>fabe</i> in <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i> shall suffer <i>chivvying</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>nana</i> <i>homies</i> and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being <i>mogued</i>.
    </li>
    <li>But continue thou in the <i>fakements</i> which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;
    </li>
    <li>And that from a <i>chavvie</i> thou hast known the <i>fabulosa</i> <i>glossies</i>, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in <i>Crystal</i> <i>Josie</i>.
    </li>
    <li>All <i>glossy</i> is <i>parkered</i> by inspiration of <i>Gloria</i>, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in <i>bonaness</i>:
    </li>
    <li>That the <i>homie</i> of <i>Gloria</i> may be <i>absolutely fantabulosa</i>, throughly furnished unto all <i>bona</i> works.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>I charge thee therefore before <i>Gloria</i>, and the <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i>, who shall <i>beak</i> the quick and the <i>stiff</i> at <i>her</i> appearing and <i>her</i> kingdom;
    </li>
    <li><i>Cackle</i> the <i>lav</i>; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.
    </li>
    <li>For the time will <i>troll</i> when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching <i>aunt nelly cheats</i>;
    </li>
    <li>And they shall turn away their <i>aunt nelly cheats</i> from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.
    </li>
    <li>But <i>varda</i> thou in all <i>fakements</i>, endure afflictions, do the <i>acting dickey</i> of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.
    </li>
    <li>For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at <i>famble</i>.
    </li>
    <li>I have <i>palavered</i> a <i>bona</i> <i>palaver</i>, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:
    </li>
    <li>Henceforth there is <i>laued</i> up for me a <i>mudge</i> of <i>bonaness</i>, which the <i>Duchess</i>, the <i>bona</i> <i>beak</i>, shall <i>parker</i> me at that <i>journo</i>: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love <i>her</i> appearing.
    </li>
    <li>Do thy diligence to <i>troll</i> shortly unto me:
    </li>
    <li>For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is <i>trolled off</i> unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.
    </li>
    <li>Only <i>Lucille</i> is with me. <i>Lell</i> <i>Marcia</i>, and <i>parker</i> <i>her</i> with thee: for <i>she</i> is profitable to me for the ministry.
    </li>
    <li>And Tychicus have I <i>laued</i> to Ephesus.
    </li>
    <li>The cloke that I <i>dry</i> at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, <i>parker</i> with thee, and the <i>glossies</i>, but especially the parchments.
    </li>
    <li>Alexander the coppersmith did me <i>dowry</i> <i>nana</i>: the <i>Duchess</i> <i>parkering</i> <i>her</i> according to <i>her</i> works:
    </li>
    <li>Of whom be thou ware also; for <i>she</i> hath greatly withstood our <i>lavs</i>.
    </li>
    <li>At my first answer no <i>homie</i> stood with me, but all <i>homies</i> forsook me: I pray <i>Gloria</i> that it may not be <i>laued</i> to their charge.
    </li>
    <li>Notwithstanding the <i>Duchess</i> stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the <i>cackling</i> might be fully known, and that all the <i>nishta kosher homies</i> might <i>aunt nell</i>: and I was <i>laued</i> out of the <i>screech</i> of the lion.
    </li>
    <li>And the <i>Duchess</i> shall deliver me from every <i>nana</i> <i>acting dickey</i>, and will preserve me unto <i>her</i> heavenly kingdom: to whom be <i>fabeness</i> for ever and ever. <i>Larlou</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.
    </li>
    <li>Erastus <i>letted</i> at Corinth: but Trophimus have I <i>dry</i> at Miletum sick.
    </li>
    <li>Do thy diligence to <i>troll</i> before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the <i>sisters</i>.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>Duchess</i> <i>Josie</i> <i>Crystal</i> be with thy <i>Fairy</i>. <i>Gracie</i> be with you. <i>Larlou</i>.
